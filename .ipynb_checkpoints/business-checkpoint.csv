business	Lebanese business people back protesters' call for change		"Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, driven by widespread anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed the country for decades. The protesters are now demanding that they go.So what are the views of Lebanon's business community, both in the country itself and abroad?The Lebanese diaspora is playing a key part in the protests, organising vigils across the world, and its economic influence is very significant - remittances to Lebanon last year were more than $7bn (£5.4bn).Dana Trometer is in her 40s, and runs a London production company. Although she's been in the UK since the 1990s, she is fully involved in the events that have been rumbling through Lebanon since mid-October, when a proposed tax on WhatsApp voice calls helped trigger wider protests over economic mismanagement, corruption, unemployment, and poor public services.Also at our breakfast meeting in a London cafe are fellow UK-based Lebanese business leaders, Mohammad Koussa and Danny Hakim. They both have strong commercial and family links to Lebanon, and their own ideas on how they want it to change. Mohammad runs a food wholesaler in Lebanon and another business in the UK, while Danny is an ex-banker who owns a tech start-up.Danny is very excited about the protests: ""I remember seeing Instagram just blow up in 90 plus cities in 35 different countries within 24 hours, that unity has never been felt before. I think this is a revolution of the young ,and the women, and love, really.""Dana is a more cautious; she remembers Lebanon's bitter civil war between 1975 and 1990. Her parents' generation went on the streets and protested, she says, ""hoping that they wouldn't have a civil war, and then they did"".But even she agrees that ""this time it is different"" and that the Lebanese are not going to accept the status quo any more, ""there's no way, there's no return"".All are immensely proud of the non-sectarian nature of the protest - and in Lebanon that matters hugely. The country has a complex communal make-up, with Shia and Sunni Muslims, and Maronite Christians the three biggest religious communities.This is institutionalised in its political organisation; parliament's seats are divided evenly between Christians and Muslims, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the president a Maronite Christian, and the speaker of parliament a Shia. Critics say this keeps the ruling caste in power and allows politicians to put their interests above those of the state.The economy and falling living standards have been at the heart of anger bubbling up among the Lebanese. Mohammad Koussa says that when he started running his business seven years ago Lebanon was planning to have a duty free arrangement with the EU.""Imagine what that gave me as a business,"" he says. ""I was looking for products to bring from Europe, and planning on that to sustain. Now they say there's a trade deficit [and] 'we need to stop this'. They want to close the country towards trade. How does that make sense? There is no economic policy vision.""Danny Hakim agrees, citing his own experience. The government wanted to boost Lebanon's tech sector and bring back experiences expats, but there are problems with that, he says.""In the UK to incorporate a company, it costs £10 and takes two hours. In Lebanon the cost is in the thousands, and there are 10 different sign-offs you need. How am I going to justify that?""In Lebanon itself, there is a similar feeling of frustration with the country's economic mismanagement.Aya Issa is one of the owners of fuel importer Issa Petrol Trade. Since the protests some banks have been imposing limits on sending US dollars abroad, a real issue for her as she works with international suppliers. She says these informal capital controls are ""really dangerous"" because they are not regulated by the central bank.The protests themselves started following a currency crisis in the country. This was caused by a shortage of US dollars in the country's commercial banks. When the importers of wheat and fuel demanded to be paid in dollars, bakeries and petrol station unions called strikes.Former financial journalist and founder of Triangle Development consultancy, Sami Halabi, says there is a ""conflict of interest"" as key politicians ""own banks which hold a large portion of the public debt"". He adds: ""The ruling class sneaks in indirect taxes on things like utility bills and the infamous WhatsApp tax. The economic structure works against people's interests.""He is not the only one criticising the banks' role in Lebanon's economic crisis. Many protesters have staged sit-ins in front of the central bank and major private sector ones. Yet Nassim Ghobril, chief economist at Lebanon's third largest bank, Byblos, feels that the sector has been unfairly picked on.Lebanon's banks, he says, have been ""assuming the responsibility, for the past 25 years, for the currency, stability of the economy, and therefore social stability,"" He says he would love to see the political class do the same - finally.With Lebanon's official unemployment rate for under-35s now 37%, it's no surprise that young people have been at the centre of the protests, Sami Halabi says as an employer he is inundated with applications from overqualified jobseekers""The country only creates about 3,000-4,000 proper high knowledge, high value added jobs. As a young person today, you are extremely angry because your ambitions far exceed what is available in the market.""Back in London, I ask Dana, Mohammad and Danny where they think Lebanon will be in a year's time.""I think that we're in a vicious loop, where we think the economy is crashing and therefore our behaviour would actually speed that up,"" says Mohammad.He thinks many would make different financial decisions if they believed that trustworthy politicians were governing, and that would get the economy moving.Politicians, people, banks, savers must stop the blame game, he says. ""After such a beautiful revolution of unity and innocence, if hope is broken it is going to be dramatic.""""Are we going to be crushed again?"" is a question on Dana's mind, but she goes on to say that ""we have broken already the big stigma - the political affiliation. The unity has been stronger.""Danny's focus is on the role the Lebanese abroad can play. ""If we play our hands right we will have a stronger economy supported by the diaspora, sending money back, investing.""Twenty-four hour electricity and a faster internet will just unlock the economic potential of Lebanon,"" he says. ""I'm hopeful. I think we can have a stronger economy if we all just work together and continue as one bloc."""
business	'I founded my business while living on the street'	Strategy by day, shelter by night	"From sleeping in a phone box to founding a six-figure business teaching martial arts, it's been an eventful two years for Gavin Eastham.In February last year, he found himself being pelted with hailstones on his first night on the streets.The 36 year-old's marriage had broken down and, having suffered a back injury, he wasn't able to work.""Because I'm not originally from north Wales, it meant I had no contacts. I had nowhere else to go,"" he said.His ex-wife thought he had somewhere else to stay but he didn't.He decided to go to the local library, initially to stay warm, but he felt time-pressured to turn things around.""I thought the minute I was homeless, I'd look homeless and if I look homeless people are going to look at me in a certain way,"" he told the BBC's Wake Up to Money.After spending a few days there, the local librarian became suspicious. He told her he had plans to set up his own business.""I thought I need to make a positive change, I need to do something,"" he said.He was also using the library for something more pressing: ""I was actually researching how to survive being homeless. I'm a bit of a city boy so I did a bit of research reading blogs and forums about how to survive on the streets.""While at night he'd focus on finding shelter, by day he was reading books on business strategy.""This sounds crazy but the only thing I've ever been good or half decent at was martial arts. How could I turn that into an opportunity to secure my future?""He started researching and came up with a company name and logo, wrote a syllabus and bought a domain name for £1.58.""I thought - if I've got a domain name I've got to keep going.""""This dream I thought that I might one day fulfil was giving me the energy I needed to survive.""After three weeks on the streets, he managed to secure temporary housing and then, in May last year, launched his martial arts school Cobra Life in Flintshire, Wales.Now he says he has a ""thriving business, turning over six figures.""With plans to franchise, he's looking to hire a full-time instructor: ""That is going to give me chance to get off the dance floor and onto the balcony, to strategise and expand,"" he said.He said the teachings of martial arts gave him the strength to continue: ""Those essential skills have been instilled since a child so even though times were tough I knew I had to persevere and focus on my goals which were simply dreams written down!"""
business	Entrepreneurs back Prince Andrew's business scheme	'Incredible connections''Important programme'	"Entrepreneurs have come out in support of Prince Andrew's business scheme for start-up firms as fears grow it may not continue amid the current controversy.Will King, founder of King of Shaves, said it was ""really sad"" the Pitch@Palace initiative had ""been affected by the personal issues around the Duke of York.""The scheme provides start-up firms with advice and contacts, but no funding.A source close to Prince Andrew said he would continue to be involved.This is despite his stepping back from public duties for the foreseeable future.There has been ongoing controversy over the prince's ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Mr King, a founding member of Pitch@Palace suggested Prince Andrew could be ""rotated out of his captaincy of the ship"" for the business initiative.He said there were plenty of royals who could take his place, including William and Kate, as well as Harry and Meghan.""If you're going to continue the Pitch@Palace in the royal environment, where you have an infrastructure that is paid for - I think, in part - by the taxpayer it would be an extraordinary shame that the palace don't see the opportunity in continuing this initiative.""He said the scheme had created £1bn of economic activity and noted that 97% of the companies who used it were still going.But asked if it can continue with Prince Andrew at the helm, he said: ""I don't know, I don't know.""Mr King said he had been invited in 2013 to a breakfast chaired by the prince's personal secretary Amanda Thirsk ""with the idea of trying to develop a UK entrepreneurial eco-system"".It was this idea which became Pitch@Palace, he said.Nick Mason, co-founder of digital identity tool Zaka, said Pitch@Palace was ""a fantastic programme for young entrepreneurs that offers valuable opportunities to learn from and connect with leaders of industry.""""The Duke of York and his team were a constant source of encouragement throughout the impeccably-run programme and are clearly passionate about empowering the wonderful ventures that participate,"" Mr Mason said.Alex Redston, co-founder of of Prison Voicemail, was one of the first people involved in the event.He said the event had put him in contact with ""one gentleman worth billions... who had incredible connections in telecoms and was interested in social impact"".""An amazing contact to make,"" Mr Redston said. ""And other people who have helped us. Because we were so early stage we didn't quite understand the absolute rocket fuel that was there at the time.""James Talbot, chief executive of audio products firm Damson, said Prince Andrew retiring from public duties ""would represent an absolute disaster for the start-up community"".""The Duke of York has provided an excellent platform for businesses, like Damson, to benefit from the network of connections and associates [to which] his status gives him access,"" Mr Talbot said.Rajeeb Dey, the chief executive of training software firm Learnerbly, said: ""Pitch@Palace has provided hundreds of entrepreneurs with unparalleled access to leading investors and influencers in the world of business.""Business giants KPMG and Standard Chartered revealed they had severed ties with the Duke of York's mentoring initiative this week.These revelations came after a BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew which critics described as a ""car crash"".Sources have told the BBC the KPMG and Standard Chartered decisions were taken before the BBC interview. Several businesses and universities are reviewing their association with Prince Andrew following the interview.Despite the prince's stepping back from royal duties, he will still continue to be involved in the entrepreneur event, a source close to Prince Andrew told the BBC.The source said Prince Andrew was integral to Pitch@Palace.""If you talk to any of the entrepreneurs you'll hear this,"" the source said, adding: ""I see it [Pitch@Palace] continuing, absolutely.""The source said none of Pitch@Palace's partners had mentioned the prince standing down, seemingly contradicting a report in the Financial Times.Pitch@Palace was aware six months ago that Standard Chartered and KPMG would not be extending their sponsorship, but other sponsors were ""steady as they go"", the source said.""People believe in the programme. It's huge and important to the economy so as long as we are finding and developing great entrepreneurs - that's why the partners are involved. They know that's important to their business,"" the source added."
business	EasyJet relaunches package holiday business	'You get a better price booking directly''Cautiously optimistic'	"EasyJet is relaunching its package holiday business as the airline looks to fill the gap in the industry left by Thomas Cook's demise earlier this year.About 20 million people fly with EasyJet to Europe annually but only 500,000 book accommodation through it.The news came as the carrier reported a 26% fall in pre-tax profits to £427m for the year to 30 September.EasyJet also said it would become the world's first major net zero carbon airline by offsetting carbon emissions.Chief executive Johan Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme: ""This is not a long-term solution, offsetting is not perfect.""I don't think it's greenwashing, everyone recognises that it works, but this is in addition to the fact that since 2000, we've reduced our carbon emissions by 30%.""He said that the company would take on the £25m cost and added: ""That's not something we're adding on to ticket prices, which makes us one of the largest carbon emissions offsetting companies in the world.""Explaining the decision to relaunch its package holidays, EasyJet said: ""The total European package holidays market is worth around £61bn per year. The UK alone is a £13bn market and has grown by 6% annually.""The way that customers are taking holidays is changing and we know customers want holidays with various durations and not the traditional seven and 14 nights.Not everyone thinks Easyjet's bet on the package holiday market is a good idea. Philip Petty says he has been booking holiday and flights separately ""for years"".""Not only can I choose what time I want to fly, I like to hand-pick where I stay,"" he says. ""You can get a better price when you book directly with a hotel.""Mr Petty was on a package holiday in Greece and slipped on a wet floor at a hotel, breaking his leg.He felt he and his wife had little support from the reps, which led him to start looking at independent holidays.""EasyJet is excited about the opportunity to build a major player in the holidays market for a low up-front investment and with limited risk.""The airline said it had conducted research which showed its customers wanted flexibility in flights and tailored holidays, and it had designed its business to respond to this.EasyJet's results showed that annual revenues rose 8.3% to £6.4bn, as it increased capacity, but total revenue per seat fell 1.8% to £60.81 due to ""some weakness in consumer confidence"".Passenger numbers for the year rose 8.6% to 96.1 million.Julie Palmer, regional partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said EasyJet was ""taking advantage of the current climate sweeping across the industry"".She added: ""EasyJet has been picking at the bones of other airlines who have suffered at the hands of falling demand, including Air Berlin's assets at Tegel Airport and Thomas Cook's runway slots at Gatwick and Bristol airports.""With Brexit continuing to drag, EasyJet will be strapping itself in for further turbulence but will be cautiously optimistic for the future and hoping for an upwards trajectory.""However, last week the boss of rival budget airline Wizz Air, Jozesf Varadi, said he was ""surprised"" to hear of EasyJet's package holiday plans.He told the Telegraph: ""I don't think this packaged holiday industry is going to flourish, I think that the model is outdated, Why should customers pay a premium for pretty much nothing?""EasyJet's shift into package holidays is hardly a Pauline conversion. It already sells about half a million packages a year, and the demise of Thomas Cook has left a gap in the market that cannot have been lost on the airline's chief executive Johann Lundgren, a former employee of Tui, Thomas Cook's main rival.It plans to roughly double its package holiday sales, which will still make it a small player besides the likes of Tui (which has a Civil Aviation Authority licence to carry 5.6 million people a year) and putting it just above British Airways' in-house holiday operation, which is licensed for just under one million people.Mr Lundgren could undoubtedly do more - EasyJet is after all probably the biggest carrier of UK customers to traditional sunshine destinations in the Mediterranean - but he will be mindful that investors tend to be nervous about successful low-cost airlines that stray away from their core business.More eye-catching perhaps is the airline's pledge to offset all its carbon emissions. Environmental campaigners will be sceptical, and the real value of offsetting schemes, which see polluters pay for trees to be planted or for low-carbon energy generation schemes, are open to question.But Mr Lundgren and the EasyJet board realise that their passengers are becoming acutely sensitive to the environmental impact of flying, and that making them feel more comfortable with an EasyJet flight makes commercial sense. It is in any event only an interim step, Mr Lundgren says, until genuinely carbon-free methods of aircraft propulsion can be found."
business	Business rates: 'We might as well hand back the keys'	'Lack of consistency''It's not easy'	"James O'Hara has spent £120,000 converting a disused public toilet in Sheffield into a popular cocktail bar.But after a more than seven-fold increase in business rates, he says he ""might as well hand back the keys"".It's stories like Mr O'Hara's that elevated the subject of business rates to take centre stage at the CBI conference on Monday.Boris Johnson pledged to review the system and Jeremy Corbyn announced plans to reform business rates, which have been blamed for helping create the challenging High Street environment that has led to store closures across the country. The Liberal Democrats have said they would scrap business rates entirely.Mr O'Hara says his bar, Public, was ""literally a toilet"" when he rented it two years ago. It is now a 24-seater cocktail bar with a turnover of about £300,000 a year.But that transformation has not escaped the attention of the government's Valuation Office Agency (VOA), which sets the value on which business rates are based.Mr O'Hara's investment has increased the so-called rateable value of the bar from £3,250 a year to £23,750. That's the rent that the VOA thinks Public should be paying.As a small business, the bar has to pay 49.1% of that rateable value in business rates.Last year, the bar paid £560 in rates, so Mr O'Hara was shocked to open this year's bill for £7,760.The businessman, who runs a number of bars in Sheffield, says there is a ""complete lack of consistency"" in the way that rates are set.He says Public, a cosy underground cocktail bar, now has the same rateable value as another one of his other premises, the Great Gatsby, a much larger pub over four floors, which banks around £1.2m a year.Mr O'Hara says he will appeal against the new rates, and he expects to win. But in the meantime, he could face a court summons if he refuses to pay the higher bill.He says the difference is ""make or break money"" for a small business.That will sound familiar to Rowena Howie - who runs Revival Retro - a boutique in London.Her neighbours shut up shop the same day that an increase in rates was announced in 2017.Ms Howie hopes she won't have to do the same with her store, but she says that her £55,000 rates valuation makes it ""exceptionally hard"" to survive as a bricks and mortar retailer.For her, headline election pledges are of no interest unless the politicians make good on them.""I'm sick and tired of empty promises,"" she says.She says small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy and she warns that it is getting harder to survive on the High Street.Sean Hughes, who runs The Boot in St Albans, knows the impact of business rate increases all too well.He comes from a family of publicans who have turned the city centre pub around since they took it on in 2004.But the extra money the pub now brings in has pushed up the rateable value, which is currently £103,000, well above the £70,000 they pay in rent for the 600-year-old property.That puts the business rates bill at about £53,000, a more than three-fold increase on the £17,000 he paid in 2017 when rates were recalculated.And Mr Hughes complains that he doesn't get much for his money.He says there are fewer police in St Albans after the local police station was closed, and he pays £9,000 a year to have his bins collected.Not only that, but his dad now has to spend more hours behind the bar because, since the rates increase, they cannot afford to replace their bar manager who left.""It does make you question whether it's worth it,"" says Mr Hughes, who works 70 hours a week and has a hand in managing three pubs in St Albans.He does it because he enjoys working in a social environment and wants to be a part of the local community.But Mr Hughes says some days he feels more like a tax collector, responsible for paying VAT, national insurance, pension contributions and, now, higher business rates, as well as calculating income tax for employees.""We're paying all of this for not very much at the end of the year,"" he says.That has forced the pub to increase the price of a pint by 50p and Mr Hughes says the price will go up again.But it is not just The Boot that is suffering.Mr Hughes says that 15% of pubs in St Albans have closed in the past three years alone - and he knows of another eight of the remaining 49 that are at risk of closure.And those kinds of statistics have attracted the attention of party leaders, who have made business rates a focus of their campaigns ahead of the forthcoming general election.Speaking at the CBI conference on Monday, Boris Johnson promised a ""big review"" of business rates and pledged to cut them further, especially for smaller businesses.Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would also reform rates ""because we know the damage they're currently doing to our High Streets and communities"".Jo Swinson pitched her party, the Liberal Democrats, as the ""natural party of business"", because of its opposition to Brexit.She also promised that a Lib Dem government would focus on small businesses, and replace business rates with a levy on commercial landlords.Business owners like Ms Howie will hope these are more than just empty promises."
business	A sweet idea that created a $40m business	Sugar-free or not?	"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Tara Bosch, the founder and chief executive of low-sugar sweets business Smart Sweets.Tara Bosch describes herself as a former ""sugar addict"".""I would be the person at the 7-11 every day, buying the penny candy,"" says the 25-year-old. ""But as I got older, I realised how much sugar was affecting my body image, my self-esteem, and just how I felt about myself.""So four years ago, fed up with how unhappy and unhealthy she was feeling, Tara stopped eating sugar. She says that she very quickly felt much better, but missing her sweets she decided to have a go at making her own no-added sugar alternatives in her kitchen in Vancouver, Canada.Testing recipes in the summer of 2015, she described it as ""going on a quest"". Eventually she was so pleased with her results that she thought there might be a business opportunity.That autumn she decided to take a leap of faith, and put this to the test. Tara dropped out of the third year of an arts degree at the University of British Columbia, so she could get the product off the ground.Just 21 at the time, she had limited credit history, and her only asset was a six-year-old small Honda car. But armed with samples and confidence, she managed to secure 105,000 Canadian dollars of funding.Today, her Vancouver-based company, Smart Sweets, is on track to see its 2019 revenues exceed CA$50m ($40m; £30m). Its range of products are market leaders in the fast-growing low-sugar sweets sector in both Canada and the US.""This year we are helping people kick more than one billion grams of sugar,"" she says.To secure the initial investment Tara had to write an intensive business plan, with detailed two-year growth forecasting. And somewhat unnervingly, she had to take out life insurance. ""One of the terms of the parties involved was life insurance, and they had to be the beneficiary,"" she says.If you're looking to cut down on your sugar intake but have a sweet tooth, then sugar-free sweets can be better than the regular sweets, say dieticians. But they may still contain carbohydrates, and some can contain significant calories and be high in saturated or trans-fats.""Keep in mind that just because a product is 'sugar free' it doesn't always mean that it's healthy,"" says the American Heart Association.Some studies also suggest that certain zero-calorie sweeteners may also stimulate appetite, which can be counterproductive for those trying to limit their calorie intake.With the funded secured, Tara searched on the internet for potential suppliers and manufacturers, and worked on finalising her recipes.""It soon became a trial and error of taking every single iteration that didn't work, and applying a new hypothesis, and then testing it again."" she says.Tara settled on using plant-based fibres, and the natural sweetener stevia, to mimic the taste and texture of traditional sugared sweets.Then to secure her first customers she used a mixture of emailing, telephoning, showing up in person, and, she says, ""Linkedin-ing"". The first retailer to sign up was Vancouver-based Choices Market, and Tara remembers that she was incredibly nervous ahead of the first meeting.""I had called and emailed with persistence, until they finally said stop by,"" she says. ""And when I arrived out front, I was so nervous that I drove away.""Then I drove back, had the meeting, and they became the first retailer to take a chance on Smart Sweets.""A few other small Canadian chains followed shortly afterwards. ""Like I said, it's about persistence,"" she says. ""I would email and show up until a business would say yes to a conversation, and from there I leveraged the success.""Tara secured her first American customers in 2018, and the US now accounts for 80% of Smart Sweets' sales. The manufacturing of the sweets also takes place in the US through contract suppliers.More The Boss features:US food entrepreneur and strategist Scott Semel says he is impressed by Tara's ""passion"".""An annual revenue of CA$50m is very successful,"" says Mr Semel, who in 2016 sold his best-selling confectionary brand Bark Thins to US giant Hershey.""Just getting to $5m isn't easy, and confectionary is dominated by a few big players. I think what's even more impressive about doing CA$50m in 2019 is the time frame in which she has achieved it.""Tara has a great feel for the market... she thinks far ahead.""Now with 47 employees, Tara plans to start exporting Smart Sweets outside of North America. She says that the success of the company has come through hard work and determination.""For me growing up, I wasn't that smart or athletic,"" she says. ""I didn't really have any talents in particular, but I always had an innate sense of urgency, resourcefulness, and the ability to make something happen if I decided I wanted to make it happen.""Smart Sweets was the first time I realised the power of those three things combined."""
business	'Brexit uncertainty is harming my business'	More time for scrutiny'Desperate for clarity''Damaging debate'	"""If you were trying to design a way to close businesses like mine, you'd behave exactly as the government has done"".Rob Tanner is on the cusp of winding up his 19-year-old business, SEA Oxford. He takes parties of Europeans - mainly teachers - sightseeing to some of the UK's most popular tourist hotspots such as Stonehenge and Bath.He says the European Union funds the teachers and that trickles down to his business.Rob has seen the number of people taking his tours drop by a fifth in the past few years, he says, which is not only affecting him, but the coach companies and host families he works with. He can't go on any longer.""At some point the uncertainty will level out - but we just don't know when that will be and if it does recover we don't know if EU visitors will return to the levels that they were at,"" he said.Frustration underpins his every word. Like many small business people, he wanted a decision to be made, and quickly. But it's all come too late for his business.He says the uncertainty is sending customers elsewhere.""People are going to Malta and Ireland now to learn English because none of the details have been ironed out,"" he said.The Federation of Small Businesses says ""the prolonged period of uncertainty"" caused by the political stalemate has left small businesses like his ""in limbo, with investment plans on hold and confidence low"".In many ways, the debate going on in the business world is the same as in Parliament's.A snap poll carried out by the Institute of Directors (IoD) indicated business leaders were split on the issue of whether politicians should vote Boris Johnson's deal through.In the survey of 655 people conducted between 17 and 19 October, a small majority (55%) thought MPs should approve the deal, as opposed to 41% who thought the Commons should vote against it.The IoD poll suggests that businesses want to avoid a no-deal and move towards either another referendum (30%) or a general election (24%).The Food and Drink Federation - which is concerned about the impact of possible delays on the UK's borders to fresh produce - welcomed the delay.Chief executive Ian Wright said it wanted the extra time to scrutinise the deal, which was only published on Thursday.""We shouldn't allow the fact that the nation is exhausted to mean we sleepwalk into mistakes that will haunt the UK economy for a generation,"" he said.Most business groups say they want the threat of leaving the European Union at the end of the month with no agreement in place to go away.The British Chambers of Commerce says they'd like to see an ""iron-clad guarantee"" on that front.However, there are also those who say they just want a decision to be made - whatever the terms. A recent survey of clients by the accountancy firm EY found the majority believe Brexit is inevitable and ""are desperate for clarity to the extent they're now willing to accept no deal if that is what it takes"".According to Stephen Welton, chief executive of the Business Growth Fund which funds high growth start-ups, businesses don't have much time left to play with.""At the moment we are stuck in increasingly circular and damaging debate,"" he said. ""One consequence is that business investment is slowing. We urgently need to redress that and a deal will be the catalyst to that.""Mark Essex, director of public policy for KPMG, agrees the impact of a continued delay will mean damage to the UK's economy - and frustration for companies.He said: ""There's a pent up level of investment to be unleashed on things like infrastructure - decarbonisation - digital connectivity - retail. People aren't sure what regulatory environment is going to be - would you make a big bet on that environment?""Whatever the specific feelings about Saturday's vote - there's no doubt that three years on from the referendum - businesses still feel paralysed by Parliament.A desire to see an end to uncertainty has been a unifying force over the past three years - and many still don't see any clarity on the way forward."
business	Peacocks set to rescue Bonmarché from collapse	Talks continue	"Bonmarché, the womenswear retailer that fell into administration in October, is set to be rescued by rival Peacocks.Peacocks has been named the ""preferred bidder"" for the business, although further negotiations are needed before the deal is secured.However, 30 Bonmarché stores will now be closed by 11 December, the administrators said, putting up to 240 jobs at risk.Bonmarché's 285 remaining stores will continue to trade.The administrators said the ""vast majority"" of these were expected to be bought by Peacocks.However, they added: ""The future of all remaining stores cannot be assured at this time and remain subject to negotiation between any future purchaser and landlords given the period of historical market difficulty on the High Street.Administrators FRP Advisory said 25 posts have already been made redundant in a number of head office and middle management roles.A spokesperson for Peacocks said: ""We are working very hard to reach a deal that secures the future of the company and the greatest number of jobs. But given the unprecedented pressures the business continues to face, it is also important to recognise this cannot be assured at this time.""We will now enter a period of advanced negotiations with the administrator and landlords to find a way forward that provides a sustainable, long-term future for the business.""Tony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, said: ""There is still a lot more work to do before we can secure the future of the business.""Whilst we are optimistic that a transaction can be completed, ultimately, it will depend on ongoing negotiations between our preferred bidder and landlords on market rents and there remains a risk that the business could cease to trade.""Peacocks has about 500 stores in the UK and was founded by Albert Frank Peacock in Warrington in 1884 as a penny bazaar, selling ""anything and everything"", according to its website.In 1940, the business moved to Cardiff, and from the 1990s it focused on clothing.It was bought out of administration itself in 2012 by Edinburgh Woollen Mill.News of the latest potential deal comes after a previous offer was rejected in April. Bonmarché told its shareholders that an offer made by Peacock's billionaire owner, Philip Day, undervalued the business and its future prospects.But Bonmarché entered administration last month, wiping out a stake Mr Day had already built up in the company.Bonmarché is among a number of High Street retailers to have fallen on hard times in recent years. The sector has been hit by a combination of growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as rising business rates and the minimum wage.Research by PwC and the Local Data Company found that a net 1,234 stores closed on the UK's top 500 High Streets in the first half of the year, with fashion retailers seeing the biggest declines.The figure was up from 1,123 in the same period a year earlier and was the highest since the survey began in 2010."
business	UK 'has particularly extreme form of capitalism'	Business shake-upProfit motive'Whatever it takes'Do the right thing?	"The UK has one of the most extreme forms of capitalism in the world and we urgently need to rethink the role of business in society. That's according to Prof Colin Mayer, author of a new report on the future of the corporation for the British Academy.Prof Mayer says that global crises such as the environment and growing inequality are forcing a reassessment of what business is for.""The corporation has failed to deliver benefit beyond shareholders, to its stakeholders and its wider community,"" he said.""At the moment, how we conceptualise business is, it's there to make money. But instead, we should think about it as an incredibly powerful tool for solving our problems in the world.""He said the ownership structure of companies had made the UK one of the worst examples of responsible capitalism.""The UK has a particularly extreme form of capitalism and ownership,"" he said.""Most ownership in the UK is in the hands of a large number of institutional investors, none of which have a significant controlling shareholding in our largest companies. That is quite unlike virtually any other country in the world, including the United States.""This heavily dispersed form of ownership means none of the owners is providing a genuinely long-term perspective on how to achieve goals while also making money.Established in 1902, the British Academy is the UK's national academy for the humanities and the social sciences. In Principles for Purposeful Business, it proposes a new formula for corporate purpose: ""to profitably solve problems of people and planet, and not profit from causing problems.""The Academy's report comes a week after the Labour Party manifesto proposed the biggest shake-up of how business is owned and run in decades. It included the nationalisation of water, rail, energy, mail, broadband and the forced transfer of company shares to employees.Prof Mayer agreed that the Labour manifesto was bold in its ambition, but said it was too traditional and old-fashioned in its way of achieving its aims.""It's very much focused on one particular means of delivery, that is through the state,"" he said.""Now, the state has an important part to play. But we should think about the state in a more imaginative way, as to how it can promote successful business, how it can reform the nature of business in society. That's what we're really looking for.""One thing on which he did agree with the Labour Party was the need to rewrite the Companies Act to specifically enshrine directors' duties to other stakeholders in law. Currently, the Act says that other stakeholders interests are subordinate to shareholders.Where he doesn't agree is in the demonisation of billionaires: ""It's not obscene to make a lot of money in the process of creating real solutions to the problems of the world.""But he hoped that such wealth would be recycled through foundations, for example, which could be the kind of long-term owners needed for the next generation of problem-solving companies.Not everyone agrees, of course, that the pursuit of profit, within the confines of the law and social norms, is bad. Matthew Lesh, from the Adam Smith Institute, says we should be cautious before we dismantle a mechanism that has produced innovation and a rise in absolute living standards.""The profit motive has raised literally billions of people out of poverty by encouraging innovation and ensuring our finite resources are used exceedingly productively,"" he said.""Mandating alternative purposes for business raises more issues than it solves. It removes the essential accountability between shareholders, whose investments are at risk, and corporate executives.""Some of these are age-old arguments between the Left and Right, but there is plenty of evidence that something fundamental is changing deep in the heart of capitalist economies.Since 1978, the American Business Roundtable of top chief executives has periodically issued Principles of Corporate Governance. For the last 40 years, all of them have reiterated the orthodoxy that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders. Until now.In August it issued a new Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, signed by 181 chief executives who committed to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders - customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.Even the famously private family that owns Mars has recently popped its head over the parapet to talk openly about the way it runs the chocolate-to-pet-food giant with annual sales of $35bn.Mars chairman Stephen Badger admits things are different now.""We've never felt the need to be public but times have changed,"" he said.""The talent [employees] really want to know what the company they work for, stands for.""Equally important is that the magnitude of the challenges facing the world - climate change, poverty, biodiversity loss - these are issues that we care deeply about.""We've got less than 10 years to get this right - incremental change is not enough. We are prepared to spend serious money on this and if that means lower profits, so be it. Whatever it takes to get the job done,""The challenge to companies is threefold. Staff who want to believe in the company they work for, consumers who may boycott the products of companies that don't get it and, of course, politicians who may legislate, tax or nationalise them out of existence.But we should be cautious about announcing the death of shareholder power.Unilever - the Anglo-Dutch makers of Marmite, PG Tips and 400 other consumer brands - has long been admired for its enlightened approach to its societal impact. In 2017, it received a surprise takeover bid from Kraft Heinz.Its response was to accelerate the sale of some businesses, increase its dividend, cut costs by 12%, raise the amount of debt in the company and give a further €5bn to shareholders through share buybacks. Steps the then chief executive, Paul Polman, now says he would rather not have taken.""Feel free to be responsible - but don't be complacent about the interests of your owners"" was the clear message and lesson learned.Alan Jope, the current Unilever chief executive, told the BBC that its focus on doing right by society and the environment was not out of fear of nationalisation, taxation or regulation, but out of fear that its products would be shunned by a new generation of consumers unless they got this stuff right.Is that doing the right thing for the wrong reason? Not really. Does it matter if it is? Probably not.Unilever's Mr Jope did have a supportive message for the Labour Party. When asked if he supported company law changes to discourage firms from placing shareholders above others, he gave a clipped and clear response: ""Yep.""One thing is certain. No matter who wins the UK election, you can expect to hear the word ""purpose"" a lot in the next few years."
business	How selling citizenship is now big business	How much does it cost to buy a passport?Global Trade	"You can be born into it, you can earn it, and you can lose it. Increasingly, you can also invest your way into it.The ""it"" is citizenship of a particular country, and it is a more fluid concept than ever before. Go back 50 years, and it was uncommon for countries to allow dual citizenship, but it is now almost universal.More than half of the world's nations now have citizenship-through-investment programmes. According to one expert, Swiss lawyer Christian Kalin, it is now a global industry worth $25bn (£20bn) a year.Mr Kalin, who has been dubbed ""Mr Passport"", is the chairman of Henley & Partners, one of the world's biggest players in this rapidly growing market. His global business helps wealthy individuals and their families acquire residency or citizenship in other countries.He says that our traditional notions of citizenship are ""outdated"". ""This is one of the few things left in the world that is tied to blood lines, or where you are born,"" he says. He argues that a rethink is very much due.""It's super unfair,"" he says, explaining that where we are born is by no means down to our own skill or talent, but instead ""pure luck"". ""What is wrong with regarding citizenship like a membership,"" he adds. ""And what is wrong with admitting talented people who will contribute?""There are those who support his argument. But for many, the idea that passports, so tied to identity, are in some way a commodity, doesn't sit well.We followed the citizenship trail to the tiny Pacific island nation of Vanuatu. Since the country introduced its new citizenship scheme four years ago, it's seen an explosion of interest. Passports now provide the biggest source of its government's revenues.For many aspiring Vanuatu passport holders, the biggest draw is visa-free travel throughout Europe.Most foreign recipients of Vanuatu passports never even step foot in the country. Instead they apply for their citizenship in offices overseas, like the licensed Vanuatu citizenship broker PRG Consulting, based in Hong Kong.Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest citizenship marketplaces. In a cafe at Hong Kong airport, we met the citizenship agent MJ, a private businessman who helps an increasing number of mainland Chinese obtain a second or even third passport.""They don't feel safe [in China],"" he says of his clients. ""They want access to Europe to open a bank account, to buy property or to start businesses.""Citizenship is a competitive global market, and for many small and island nations, notably in the Caribbean - the price for a passport is around $150,000. The cost of a Vanuatu passport is said to be around the same level.A Vanuatu passport, MJ explains, is ""so fast"" to arrange (you can get one in just 30 days), and that helps make it a popular choice. But Mr Kalin and others caution that Vanuatu has a reputation for corruption. As a result, Henley & Partners and others do not deal with the Vanuatu citizenship programme.However, this doesn't stop the interest from China. A few years ago Hong Kong television channels aired catchy TV advertisements promoting Vanuatu citizenship, aimed at the territory's steady flow of visitors from the mainland.So how many Chinese clients actually visit Vanuatu, after receiving citizenship? Maybe one in 10, guesses MJ.Port Vila is the capital of Vanuatu, and a city of contrasts. The roads are often flooded and scarred with potholes. There's not a single set of traffic lights, but congestion is worsening thanks to the growing number of shiny four-wheel drives.It's a tax haven, and recently rejoined the EU's ""blacklist"" of countries, over transparency and corruption issues.The country's people - known as Ni Vanuatu - were only officially recognised as citizens themselves in 1980, when the country achieved independence. Previously it was an Anglo-French condominium called the New Hebrides, and the people are scattered over a daisy chain of more than 80 islands.Less than 40 years ago, they were stateless. A fact not lost on former Prime Minister Barak Sope.""I didn't have a passport until 1980,"" he says, sitting in a hotel and casino on Port Vila's main road. ""I had to travel with a piece of paper the British and the French gave to me. It was humiliating.""Mr Sope says it is a ""betrayal"" for Vanuatu to sell its citizenship, and points to the flood of Chinese investment in the region. ""The Chinese have so much more money than us,"" he says exasperated.The Chinese investment is criticised by locals such as Mr Sope, who complain that the Chinese companies keep all the money, and only employ Chinese labour.Vanuatu's all male government, one of only three countries in the world where women are entirely excluded from politics, was not keen to speak to us about its citizenship scheme. But we tracked down a government appointed citizenship agent, Bill Bani, who explains his take on the initiative.""We have to look at Vanuatu on a global scale,"" he says. ""Other countries sell passports to make their living, we don't have a lot of natural resources. It's bringing in a lot of money to Vanuatu.""But for the mainly rural population the policy has been highly controversial since its inception in 2015.Anne Pakoa, a community leader, shows us around a typical village made up of corrugated iron shacks. It's just 10 minutes' drive down a dirt road from the shops and restaurants of the capital but feels a world away.Anne says that local communities aren't seeing the money from the passport sales, despite promises that the scheme would rebuild infrastructure and homes after the devastating Cyclone Pam in 2015.""Our ancestors died for our freedom. Now people are carrying the same green passport I carry? For $150,000? Where is the money? I think this has to stop,"" she says.Susan, another woman from the same village, shows us a dirty well. ""I want the government to provide a running tap, so that the children can have a shower, and drink clean and safe water,"" she says.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:With demand from the Chinese market booming, Dan McGarry, who runs the local newspaper, says it will be hard to imagine a change in policy anytime soon.Passport sales now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue, according to Dan. ""For a tiny country like ours this is a big deal. But we have to ask ourselves, is this what we fought for? Is this right? Is it right to sell our hard won sovereignty to the highest bidder?""It's a question that many countries, not just Vanuatu, will have to grapple with in an increasingly globalised world. But as Mr Kalin, from Henley & Partners, says: ""Citizenship through investment, and investment migration programmes, are nothing but a reflection of a world where everything has become more fluid.""Two radio documentaries that accompany this story are available on the BBC World Service - How To Buy Your Own Country and Passport To Paradise."
business	Will Johnson's Brexit plan work for business?		"Quite naturally the response to the Prime Minister's new Brexit offer to the European Union has focused on the impact in Ireland and Northern Ireland.But set behind the important complexities of Irish regulatory alignment and the PM's reference to ""de minimis"" customs checks in Ireland is a more fundamental shift about the overall shape of a future relationship with the European Union.It is a substantial change from the deal negotiated by Theresa May that would have seen the UK, in Boris Johnson's words, as ""closely integrated"" with EU custom arrangements and ""aligned with EU law in many areas"".The PM wrote to Jean Claude Juncker: ""That proposed future relationship is not the goal of the current UK Government"".That is why he says the backstop is a ""bridge to nowhere"". But in overall economic terms it is vitally important in and of itself.The new plan means we will no longer be closely integrated or aligned with EU law in many areas, and that is therefore of significant consequence to those industries dependent on existing frictionless trading arrangements.In the notes accompanying the PM's proposal it says there is ""no need for the extensive level playing field arrangements envisaged in the previous Protocol"".The 25 pages of such arrangements covering taxation, environmental protection, labour standards, state aid and competition have been deleted from the legal text handed to the EU.In fact, for many Eurosceptic rebel MPs this is the very reason they now back these proposals.But the level playing field commitments were also a key part of the Political Declaration agreed by Mrs May too that envisaged ""comprehensive arrangements [that] will create a free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation, underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition"".Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, the PM admitted that the political declaration would be amended. Again this is to the delight of Eurosceptic MPs, who anticipate the unfettered ability to do trade deals around the world.But the reason Mrs May tried to negotiate these points was because she wanted to leave open a path to continuing frictionless trade with the European Union for those sectors that wish for it, require it, and indeed have been built up in the UK on this basis.For example, Mr Johnson has himself said that he can negotiate a deal with the EU that avoids the need for ""rules of origin"" checks, required to verify that enough parts in a car or an engine come from the UK or Europe.This was explicitly in the original Political Declaration, but only as a result of building on the single customs territory, the level playing field, and ultimately the backstop.Likewise the promise of a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement with the EU was explicitly linked to level playing field commitments. The previous Political Declaration also prioritised continued access to key EU agencies.All these factors were crucial to the backing by manufacturing industry and others for the first version of the deal.They offered long-term protection for their complicated ""just in time"" supply chains. It has not gone unnoticed by international advanced manufacturers. As one carmaker told the BBC: ""A simple free trade agreement might work for selling cars, but not for making cars"".Also, many Labour MPs were asking for more level playing field commitments, not fewer or even none. On the other hand, Eurosceptics have welcomed the extra freedoms on trade negotiations this move offers.But this is a trade-off between protecting existing ways of manufacturing, and facilities, that have prospered within the European Union, its customs union and single market, and the ability to strike deeper trade deals with the likes of the US by being open to recognition of its regulatory standards.The answer to this may revolve around an argument that once a withdrawal deal is passed, the actual shape of a future relationship then becomes a matter for a new government given a general election mandate.The overall package agreed by Mrs May was, by design, consistent with a ""spectrum of outcomes"".The question for businesses, MPs and the country about this notable change in approach, is the extent to which a new legally binding withdrawal treaty predetermines a more distant relationship with the EU."
business	Npower to axe up to 4,500 jobs under closure plan	Size matters for energy companies'Cruel blow'	"Energy firm Npower is to cut up to 4,500 UK jobs as part of a plan to make it more profitable.Three call centres are under threat of closure, at Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, an office in Hull and one in Worcester.Unions called the action a ""cruel blow"" for the company's workers in the run-up to Christmas.Under the restructuring, Npower's owner E.On will merge computer systems to save money.""The UK market is currently particularly challenging,"" said Johannes Teyssen, E.On chief executive.""We've emphasised repeatedly that we'll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability.""The company said reports from unions of 4,500 job cuts were of the correct ""order of magnitude"", but that the final figure would not be announced while it is still consulting with unions.There are around 2,500 jobs at Houghton-le-Spring, and more than 600 at each of the Hull and Worcester offices.Npower's other sites in the UK are at Leeds, Birmingham, Swindon, Solihull and Oldbury.The restructuring plan - which is set to cost Npower £500m - would see small businesses and consumers served by the same computer systems and customer service teams. Large industrial customers would still be served separately.This is a Goldilocks moment in the energy sector. Businesses do not want to be too big or too small to be just right.The biggest suppliers have pointed to the pressures they face on their domestic business from the energy price cap, although this has been to the benefit of millions of consumers. Legacy IT systems also cost a lot.Meanwhile, 16 small energy companies have collapsed since the beginning of last year. Many had grown too quickly, leading to terrible customer service. Their size also meant they struggled to cope with price changes on the wholesale markets.So, that leaves those in the middle, some of which have been successfully picking up domestic customers through switches and serving them through more nimble IT systems.Analysts Cornwall Insight say challenger brands now hold a 30% share of the household energy market, up from 18% two years ago. In four years, it says there could be a 50/50 split between the big six and the challengers. Npower's announcement adds some weight to that prediction.Germany-based E.On said profit for the first nine months of its financial year fell 27% to €2.3bn (£2bn).The firm said its division serving households would effectively be merged into E.On's. The government-imposed price cap had eroded profits, as it had at competitors, it said.Its division serving other businesses ""is a profitable very good business,"" it said, and would keep the Npower brand name.The GMB union said the announcement would be a ""body blow"" to Npower workers.""Government has to urgently wake up to the impact that the price cap is having on good and reasonably well-paid jobs in UK energy companies.""Npower is a poorly managed company with significant losses in the UK but it's always the workers that face the brunt of poor management coupled with regulation that sends work overseas whilst sacking energy workers in the UK.""Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said the news was a ""cruel blow"" for workers.""They've been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas.""The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse. If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties,"" he said, urging the government to take ownership of the retail businesses of the six largest providers.Npower, one of the big six energy providers in the UK, announced plans in January to cut 900 jobs in another attempt to save costs.The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap, which began at the start of January.If you are an employee for Npower have you been given news about your job?

business	Downloading: 'People said it would end record labels'		"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to UK music industry veteran Jeremy Lascelles, the co-founder and chief executive of Blue Raincoat Music.Jeremy Lascelles says there was ""total and utter panic"" across the entire record industry when illegal music file sharing took off.""People were saying it was the end of record labels, and that we had better close everything down, and sue absolutely everyone who was illegally downloading music. Everyone was taking the view that we were finished.""Speaking at his office in central London, he says the explosion of illegal downloading in 2000 terrified record labels. ""It was such an obvious threat to our business model. And for probably the next 15 years the record industry did indeed go into a tailspin.""At the time Jeremy was on the council of the BPI, the UK record industry's trade body. He was also the chief executive of music publisher Chrysalis Music.While most of his colleagues at the BPI wanted to sue illegal downloaders, he argued against it. ""The general view was to sue everyone, you know, even some granny in Swansea because her grandson had used her computer.""I thought this was just insane, that the PR would be catastrophic and the genie was out of the bottle anyway,"" he says. ""I didn't know what the solution was myself, but I knew that threatening people was not the way to solve things.""Born in London in 1955, Jeremy says he became obsessed with music from about the age of seven. ""I had two older brothers, and we'd pool our pocket money to buy the latest singles or albums. You could get three singles for a quid.""In his late teens he dropped out of school to manage a band formed by one of his brothers. ""The name of the group was the Global Village Trucking Company,"" he says. ""I was tasked with booking them gigs. So I took a big bag of two pence pieces, went to the local phone box, and just started calling up pubs that had live music.""Jeremy then spent most of the 1970s as a tour manager for bands including Curved Air, whose drummer - Steward Copeland - went on to form The Police.In 1979 he was offered a job in the A&R department at Sir Richard Branson's Virgin, where he stayed for the next 13 years, rising to head that division. A&R stands for ""artists and repertoire"", and involves both finding new talent, and looking after the development of a label's existing artists.Looking back, he says the 1980s was ""a great period for British pop music, a different world to today"". During the decade record sales soared, further fuelled by the introduction of the compact disc, which meant that many music lovers bought CD versions of albums they already owned on vinyl or cassette.During his time at Virgin, he worked with acts such as Phil Collins, Culture Club, the Human League, and Simple Minds.""I worked very closely with Phil Collins in particular, and I have nothing but good things to say about him, he is a lovely man,"" says Jeremy. ""Even at the height of his success he was quite insecure. He thought it could all disappear overnight.""He used to send me demos of his songs to check out, and he'd say that I was the only person who would tell him anything other than the sun shines out of his proverbial.""And Culture Club were in the office all the time. They'd just turn up unannounced, but you always knew when they were on their way, because a group of their really dedicated fans would arrive about 15 minutes beforehand, and stand outside.""In 1992 Jeremy left Virgin shortly after Sir Richard had sold up to EMI, then the UK's largest record label. He admits that he and Sir Richard had a big falling out over the sale. ""Richard had lost interest in the record label, he was obsessed with his airline by that point. We had a big, ugly row, but that's history.""After working as a consultant for a few years, in 1994 Jeremy took up the top job at Chrysalis Music.Did he think that the record industry had got complacent by the time illegal music downloads burst onto the scene in 2000? ""I don't think that we thought the good times would go on forever, but certainly we realised that they were good times.""More The Boss features:After a number of years of real pain in the industry, he says it was effectively saved by Spotify and the other streaming services. ""The record industry was incapable of thinking its way out of the trouble, and then music streaming just fell like a gift from the gods.""Streaming has its critics, but it's just a different business model to selling physical records,"" says Jeremy. ""It's a volume or nickel-and-dime business - tiny margins, but from huge streaming numbers.""You do hear arguments from artists that they are not earning a lot of money from streaming, but that is probably because they are stuck on old contracts with their record labels. But if you are an artist who does direct deals with the streaming platforms then you can make good money.""But streaming has greatly reduced the importance of the record labels, he agrees, with power mainly transferring to the artist management companies. ""An artist's manager is now at the centre of everything,"" says Jeremy.While the global record industry has seen ""a strong recovery"" over the past five years, ""we haven't yet, on a macro level, re-entered the glory years,"" says Tim Ingham, of trade website Music Business Worldwide.""Don't forget that the annual revenue of the global record industry was essentially cut in half between 1999, circa $29bn [£22bn] and 2013, just under $15bn,"" he says. Yet with worldwide industry revenues topping $19bn last year ""there's plenty of money to be made, and plenty of growth ahead,"" he says.Since 2014, Jeremy has been chief executive of London-based Blue Raincoat Music, which combines both artist management and music publishing, alongside running the Chrysalis record label.""It is a source of total, utter astonishment that I'm still working in the music industry after 47 or so years,"" he says. ""I'm still getting paid to do what is essentially my hobby. I'm a very lucky guy."""
business	Victoria Beckham fashion label makes another loss		"Victoria Beckham's fashion business has posted another annual loss as demand for the former Spice Girl's high end clothes ""plateaued"".Victoria Beckham Limited, which has not made a profit since it launched in 2008, reported a loss of £12.3m for 2018.Sales slipped 16% to £35m, amid weaker wholesale demand.Chairman Ralph Toledano said sales of clothing and accessories had levelled off after years of growth.""The performance was in line with expectations, so we were not surprised. Our goal is to reach profitability as soon as possible,"" he told trade journal Business of Fashion.Mrs Beckham launched her label in 2008 with a collection of luxury dresses, and now sells fashion and accessories in more than 400 stores around the world.But while she has received critical praise, the label has struggled financially, leading Mrs Beckham to say earlier this year that it was ""not a vanity project"".""If I want this brand to still be here in 10, 20, 30, 40 years' time, I need to break even, and then I need to be profitable,"" she told the Financial Times in March. ""We're on the right track to do that, but it's not going to happen tomorrow.""The company has been trying to improve its performance, launching its own cosmetics range, striking a partnership with Reebok, and making price cuts.But it said weaker demand from wholesale customers had hit performance in 2018.Mr Toledano said: ""I firmly believe that our destiny is in our hands. We have a great talent in Victoria and, if you take that asset with a dream team, we can do it.""Mrs Beckham controls the business with her husband and former Manchester United star David Beckham, via their company Beckham Brands Holdings.The group, which manages Mr Beckham's endorsement deals and stake in football club Inter Miami FC, also saw a sharp fall in sales in 2018.Losses at Mrs Beckham's label were partly to blame, as well as weaker income from Seven Global, a joint venture that manages some of his corporate partnerships.It helped push Beckham Brand Holdings to its first ever net loss of £1.6m in 2018, which followed a net profit of £12.3m in the previous year."
business	Black Friday: I feel guilty about how much I return	What is Black Friday?Environmental costBlack Friday boycotters	"Harriet Houghton loves shopping for clothes. There is an excitement, she says, when she discovers something fresh that she feels good in.But because Harriet shops mainly online, she often finds that what looks good on a computer is disappointing in reality, and she ends up sending most of it back.This week alone, for example, she returned £250 worth of shopping.""In person, things can be wildly unflattering,"" she says.Harriet is a so-called serial returner, someone who buys items and returns most of them, putting already struggling shops under pressure.People like her are a problem for retailers, particularly in the peak sales season around Black Friday and in the run-up to Christmas.Rebound, a technology firm that helps shops to manage returns, predicts handling the process will cost UK retailers £2.6bn over the next month.Harriet thinks it would be a good idea if retailers banned serial returners because it would encourage her to make more considered decisions.She also worries about the environmental impact of returning so many clothes.""I feel guilty about it a lot,"" she says.Reports have suggested that it can cost a retailer twice the price of delivery for a product to be returned to the supply chain.When a coat comes back to the warehouse it has to reprocessed, cleaned, repaired, repackaged and made ready for its new owner. In total, it will pass through seven pairs of hands before it is back on sale again.Rebound says online clothing firms, where the fit can be difficult to gauge, are particularly hard hit.Christmas is the worst time of year for High Street retailers because the peak shopping period means the returns process can be delayed.As a result, by the time a product makes it back onto the shelves it might be considered old and have to be sold at a discount.The day that shops promote special offers was the name given to the event when it was set up in the US.Traditionally it has always started the day after the American holiday of Thanksgiving, when shops in the US drop their prices for 24 hours.It was designed by shops and other retailers to encourage people to start splashing the cash in the run-up to Christmas.Some say it became known as Black Friday because it was the day that many stores became profitable.Increasingly, retailers are fighting back.According to a recent survey by Barclaycard, one in five has made their returns policy tougher, especially when they can tell that shoppers have used items before returning them.But it's not just the retailers that are suffering.For every item returned, there is an environmental cost to processing the return.Greenpeace is running a campaign to counter the consumerism promoted by holidays such as Black Friday and asking people to turn to home-made gifts this holiday season.""We're encouraging people to get together to make things instead of buying them, repair stuff instead of throwing it away, and share experiences instead of hoarding more gadgets, toys and clothes that will soon turn to waste,"" says Greenpeace UK's head of climate, Rosie Rogers.And not all retailers are taking part in Black Friday.Supermarket chain Asda, which was one of the first retailers to start Black Friday promotions in the UK, has said it will not take part because its year-round deals are good enough.An Asda spokesperson said: ""We don't just want to offer our customers great deals for one day of the year, which is why we keep our prices low every day.""Smaller retailers are also resisting. Yorkshire businesswoman Debbie Gillespie, who makes bespoke wedding cakes, is refusing to take part because she believes she offers good value to her customers all year round.She has built up the baking business that she runs from her kitchen in Huddersfield over the past five years.""Why should the customers I have, who want to pay the right amount of money, be disadvantaged by a quick deal? I don't think it is fair on them,"" she says.When she says that when she shops herself, she would rather pay the proper price for something, especially if it is offered by a local business.""I base my business on honesty and integrity. Dishing out Black Friday deals doesn't sit right with me."""
business	US gun laws must be stricter, say business chiefs		"The leaders of 145 US companies have sent a letter urging Congress to enact stricter gun laws as pressure builds on lawmakers to respond to gun violence.The letter calls on Congress to expand background checks and create new ways to prevent access to firearms.It follows mass shootings in California, Texas and Ohio that left dozens dead.Signatories included dozens of tech companies, such as Airbnb and Uber, as well as media and financial firms.Also signing his name was Joshua Kushner, head of Thrive Capital and brother to Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor.""Gun violence in America is not inevitable; it's preventable,"" the business chiefs wrote in the letter. ""There are steps Congress can, and must, take to prevent and reduce gun violence.""An average of 100 people a day are shot and killed in the US. Polls have shows that nearly half of all Americans expect another mass shooting to happen soon.Businesses have long avoided the controversial subject, but in recent years a spate of high-profile attacks at schools and festivals have pushed them into the debate.Retailers, including most recently Walmart, have limited or banned gun sales and asked the public not to carry weapons openly in their stores even where legally permitted.In Wednesday's letter, the business chiefs from companies such as Levi Strauss, Pinterest, Bain Capital, Gap and Brookfield Property Group, called the situation an ""urgent public health crisis"".""Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,"" they wrote.It remains unclear whether Congress will act.This week, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives took up bills that seek to remove guns from people deemed a risk, ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and prohibit people convicted of violent hate crime misdemeanors from possessing firearms.But the Senate, which has a Republican majority, has stayed quiet on the subject, and US President Donald Trump has waffled on his position."
business	Travel firm boss aims to keep it in the family		"The boss of Hays Travel, which bought Thomas Cook's High Street shops after it collapsed, has told the BBC he will not sell the enlarged business.John Hays, who owns the chain with his wife Irene, said that he received approaches to buy the Sunderland-based business ""pretty well every week"".But he had ""no intention"" to sell the business started in his mother's childrenswear shop in 1980.""We love the model that we've got,"" he saidHe told BBC's Today programme: ""My wife Irene and I own all of the company.""All the profits that we make, we can put back into the business to grow the business, create more investment more jobs and keep it going"".Mr Hays was speaking the day after Hays Travel said it would hire an extra 1,500 staff - 200 for at its head office in Sunderland, 500 to handle foreign exchange, and an apprentice for each of its 737 branches.He said the business had an ""urgent need"" for staff in January, its busiest time of year.The Thomas Cook deal has transformed Hays from a business which previously had 190 shops and 1,900 staff to one which which will have 5,700. staff after its hiring spree.It took on 2,330 former Thomas Cook staff after it agreed to buy the 555 shops run by the 178-year old tour operator, which collapsed in October.Hays decision to recruit more staff is regarded as a boost for the package holiday market, which involves buying flights and hotels in one bundle.It is a market that Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has said is ""over"", although this week EasyJet relaunched its package holiday business.Mr Hays acknowledged the market was changing, but he said: ""The traditional two weeks in the sun is still a major part... but increasing we sell cruises that have a pre-stay or post-stay.""People might want a few days in Venice, Sydney or Hong Kong, before or after cruises and additionally people are travelling much further afield, much more exotic long-haul holidays. It's a much bigger share of our business. ""Mr Hays told the Today programme that there was a need for High Street stores: ""More than half the customers who book in our stores have researched online, on our website or engaged with us by social media - that's the way people operate these days."""
business	Supermarket considers rationing small business buyers	Not the first timeDiscounters are different'Hard to pick worse date'	"A senior executive at a major food retailer has told the BBC it is considering introducing rationing.It will prevent firms that have not made their own no-deal Brexit plan from using food retailers as wholesalers.But he said he did not envisage that the limits would affect normal retail customers.""One potential problem is that businesses who are struggling with their supply chains effectively use ours,"" he said.""We would need to limit the amount restaurants or convenience stores, for example, that are short of stock could buy,"" said the executive, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.""We wouldn't use the word rationing but that is effectively what it is. Limiting the volumes small businesses can purchase so that our retail customers get a chance to get what they need.""Supermarkets already use rationing of sorts to limit the amount of items on special promotions people can buy.No-deal Brexit rationing would work in a similar way - with the limits advertised on the shelf labels and enforced at the checkout.Another boss, former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King, agreed that some bigger retailers would effectively become wholesalers as it has happened before.""It's very likely that businesses will turn to supermarkets as they have the most sophisticated supply logistics. In previous weather related hold-ups or port blockades you have quite quickly seen smaller traders going to where the last stocks can be found.""""No-one wants to use the r-word, rationing, but in a no deal scenario it will be inevitable. Suppliers are the ones who support and pay for promotions and they have access to point of sale data to make sure they are not being treated as wholesalers.""The attitude is very different at discounters like Aldi and Lidl according to a former employee. For them, selling out of an item it is not a problem in the same way as the major supermarkets.""You don't lose points for selling out - in fact it enhances the ""value"" proposition to shoppers - this was such a good deal it's now gone,"" said the BBC's discounter source. ""The truth is, a lot of market traders, restaurants and convenience stores already use discount grocery retailers as wholesalers.""Food retailers say that a no-deal Brexit date of October 31st is much more challenging that the previous deadline of March 29th. Justin King said there were two reasons.""First, retailers have started accumulating stock for Christmas, which means warehouses are full of frozen, chilled and ambient goods.""Second, the beginning of autumn sees the UK much more reliant on overseas fresh produce.""""Year-round we import nearly a third of our food from the EU. If you had to pick a time to leave the EU without a deal - it would be hard to pick a worse date than October 31"".Recently leaked government no-deal preparation documents revealed that in a worst case scenario, flows of imports after three months could still be between 50-70% of current levels. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for a no-deal scenario in exiting the EU, said this was a worst-case scenario and that Brexit planning had accelerated since Boris Johnson became PM.The government has since tried to distance itself from this analysis describing it as out of date and irrelevant. Food retailers will be hoping they are correct - because according to Justin King, ""if import levels are that low for that long we will have a major crisis"".The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We have a highly-resilient food supply chain and consumers in the UK have access to a range of sources of food. This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances.""The food industry is well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply, from adverse weather damaging crops in other countries to transport issues abroad. The UK has robust supply chains across a range of countries to provide our food, in addition to the countless domestic food producers across the UK."""
business	No-deal bill a 'chink of light' for business	Corbyn fears	"Progress in passing a bill to stop a no-deal Brexit in parliament has been a ""chink of light"" for UK business, according to the head of Confederation of British Industry (CBI).However, Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC the ""cloud has not gone away"" for companies until a deal is agreed.She said many would have to keep stockpiling, even though the bill is likely to be ready for royal assent on Monday.""The clock is still ticking,"" she said.On Thursday, the government confirmed the bill - designed to force the prime minister to seek an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline - would complete its passage through the Lords on Friday.The proposed legislation was passed by MPs on Wednesday, inflicting a defeat on Prime Minister Boris Johnson.However, the government - which wants the UK to leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal - is seeking support for an election on 15 October.As a result, Ms Fairbairn said, many businesses would continue to prepare for a potential no-deal.""So many businesses are stockpiling for 31 October in the same way they did for 29 March at enormous cost and expense,"" she said.""It's so wasteful and I think they will have to continue to do that until they know otherwise.""And I think more and more are deeply concerned about the long-term effect on their competitiveness; they are seeing a loss of market share internationally that is very hard to claw back.""The CBI has previously said leaving the EU with a deal is essential to protect the economy and jobs.And it has said that, despite spending billions on preparing for no deal, many businesses are not ready for the shock it might cause.A survey from manufacturing lobby group Make UK and the auditors BDO came to a similar conclusion. It found UK firms were less prepared for no deal than in March, while Brexit uncertainty was dragging on demand.Despite this, Ms Fairbairn said few CBI members viewed the prospect of a Labour government following a potential October election as much better than no deal, citing concerns over Jeremy Corbyn's plans to renationalise industries and hand company shares to workers.""I think this is a choice no business wants to have to make. In terms of the policies of a Corbyn government, some of them are deeply damaging.""Some politicians have argued that warnings about the potential damage of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated.Before becoming Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg said in July that quitting the EU without a deal could result in an £80bn boost for the economy.He also dismissed as ""pure silliness"" Treasury forecasts warning of a £90bn hit to the UK - projections that former chancellor Philip Hammond later described as ""terrifying""."
business	Mini-bond marketing to regular savers banned by watchdog	What is a mini-bond?Why have they been in the spotlight?'Inappropriate'	"Marketing of high-risk investments - known as mini-bonds - to regular savers is to be banned by the City regulator.Armchair investors have been tempted by the returns promised on these speculative bonds, which were often much greater than mainstream products.But they have been at the heart of scandals, such as the collapse of London Capital & Finance (LCF) when 12,000 people lost money.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) marketing ban starts in January.The ban will last initially for 12 months, while the FCA considers permanent rules.A mini-bond is described by the FCA as being a kind of IOU issued by a company to an investor. In return, the investor receives a fixed rate of interest over a set period of time. At the end of this period, the investors' money is due to be repaid.The return on investors' money entirely depends on the success and proper running of the issuer's business. If the business fails, investors may get nothing back.The ban applies to arrangements where funds raised from a mini-bond are used to lend to a third party, invest in other companies or buy properties.The FCA only has power to intervene in marketing - not in the sale of the products themselves.The regulator said they could still be marketed to ""sophisticated investors"", who could declare themselves able to understand the risks, or high net-worth individuals with an annual income of more than £100,000 or net assets of £250,000 or more.Earlier this year, people lost money on two investments involving mini-bonds.Almost 12,000 people who put a total of £236m into a high-risk bond scheme marketed as a fixed-rate ISA with London Capital & Finance (LCF), lost their money.LCF advertised itself as a low-risk ISA, but in reality the fund did not qualify as an ISA.Then last month, investors who put money into two businesses started by Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud were warned they could lose their investment.HAB Land Finance and its owner HAB Land called in liquidators after a period of ""difficult trading"".Potential investors were pitched mini-bonds with 8% returns to crowdfund two projects.Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, told the BBC's Today programme: ""This is the sixth piece of intervention we're doing this year. We are also in close discussions with the internet service companies, because we want to limit the marketing of these things through that channel.""We think it is inappropriate to market the complex versions of these instruments to retail customers, not to the high net-worth individuals, but to retail customers.""We want to see more action. I'm keen that the legislation that the government proposed on online harms - which I know addresses really important issues which are outside our world - can also include financial harms.""I also want more action from Google - I think they can play a big role because it is the major channel now and we find these things just popping up all the time.""Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, said she could understand the attraction of mini-bonds.""Savers are now in the unfortunate position where even if they can lock their money away for four years, they will only get 2%. So the prospect of lending money to a company via a mini-bond for a similar period and getting four times that amount, or more, is tempting,"" she said.""But mini-bonds are paying higher rates than bank accounts precisely because they do contain an element of risk - essentially the risk that the company could go out of business.""And it's often too difficult for customers to assess if are they paying enough to take that risk."""
business	How business is adapting to Hong Kong's new reality	'Difficult tightrope'Pressure mountsTransport shutdown	"Foreign companies face a new business reality in Hong Kong. There's a rising sense of uncertainty washing over the corporate world here, as firms confront a shifting political landscape after months of unrest.Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in pro-democracy protests that have drawn the ire of many in mainland China.Just this past weekend, thousands of people took to the streets to mark the fifth anniversary of China's government banning full democratic elections in Hong Kong, despite police outlawing the protests.And on Sunday, demonstrators aimed to block access to the airport by suspending transport links in the city.Business is counting the cost of the damage these protests have inflicted on the reputation of Hong Kong as a global financial hub, but far more worrying for companies is what many say is the strong-arming by China of companies in Hong Kong.Cathay Pacific provides the strongest example yet of how perceived missteps in Beijing's eyes can harm businesses in the territory.Dressed in black and carrying signs, hundreds of protesters gathered at a rally last week to support staff from the airline who say they lost their jobs because they supported the protests.No gas masks or tear gas here, just ordinary workers trying to make their voices heard.Many at the rally told me they were worried they could lose their jobs too - simply for thinking or saying something Beijing may not like.""It's become more like China,"" one woman told me. ""These are tactics used by Communist governments to silence people. Like allowing colleagues to tell on each other, just because they see something that is not in favour of the government. They could report that to the authorities and get that member of staff to be fired for no other reason.""It's not an unrealistic fear.Earlier this month Cathay Pacific saw the high-profile resignation of chief executive Rupert Hogg, who said he had to take responsibility for the controversy over some of his staff joining pro-democracy protests, angering Beijing.But many speculated Mr Hogg was forced out, because that's what China wanted.""I've never seen anything quite like this,"" said one prominent businessman in Hong Kong, who didn't want to be identified.""We have to walk a difficult tightrope now,"" he said. ""No multinational is leaving yet, I've not seen any evidence of capital outflows, but companies are going to have to tell their staff to be far more careful about what they say and what they do. The Cathay Pacific example was a warning from Beijing.""Many in this city don't see themselves as part of China. They value being distinct and separate.One country two systems has meant the rules have always been different here, and that's what's helped Hong Kong thrive.But the sense now is that's changing.Many in Hong Kong's crucial financial industry are reluctant to talk about how they're reacting to the political shifts, fearful of being singled out by China.But sometimes actions speak louder than words.Take, for example, the full page ads in newspapers that banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered took out to condemn the violence in Hong Kong.Analysts say for companies that make most of their revenue from China, it is now more important than ever to be seen as supportive of Beijing's position on the protests.And there's already evidence that some businesses are bowing to pressure from Beijing.Hong Kong's MTR Corp runs the subway system in the city. It's used by the majority of Hong Kongers and is seen as a world class transport service.It's also the main way protesters have been making their way around the city during the weekend demonstrations.That's led to harsh editorials in China's government mouthpieces the People's Daily and Global Times which have slammed MTR Corp for allowing them on board.Subsequently the railway operator closed down stations on two of its main lines over a weekend when protests were being held, in a move that was widely seen as giving in to China's demands - which it denied.While MTR Corp doesn't make as much money from the Chinese market as Cathay Pacific does, it does operate some lines on the mainland and saw revenues from China grow by 44% in 2018.The harsh reality is that companies will have to ""bend like bamboo"", and do what Beijing wants if they want to keep servicing the Chinese market, says Steve Vickers who runs a political risk consultancy in Hong Kong.Mr Vickers says in the future Hong Kong-based firms may have to employ government liaisons the way they have in China, to navigate the increasingly tricky political landscape.""At the end of this, I think we will see further control from Beijing,"" he told me.""Does toeing the line with Beijing now damage my [standing in the] global market?"" he said, referring to the decision businesses based in Hong Kong have to make and the difficult position they're in - whether to side with pro-democracy protesters, or against them.""Or do I kowtow now and protect my position on the mainland? That's the big decision that people are making.""But it's a contract that veterans in Hong Kong have always understood.In the city's iconic entertainment district Lan Kwai Fong, I met Allan Zeman, the man who helped to build it.Dotted with bars and restaurants, and people spilling out onto the streets enjoying the midweek revelry, you can almost forget that this is a city beset by protests.Mr Zeman told me that doing business in China means understanding the culture, and that all Beijing wants is some 'respect.'""I've been in China for more than 35 years, I've done business there for 35 years,"" he told me. ""I understand it. These are the rules. If you want to do business there abide by the rules.""It sounds simple enough, but it's at the root of the conundrum now facing Hong Kong."
business	Christmas dinner 'could cost more this year'	'Relentless' price rises	"The traditional Christmas dinner is likely to make a bigger dent in your wallet this year, because supply issues have pushed up prices.Fewer turkeys have been hatched this year after high summer temperatures reduced the number of eggs, according to business consultancy CGA.Meanwhile, wet weather and floods have hit supplies of vegetables such as Brussels sprouts and potatoes.It said the risk was supermarkets could pass on the higher costs to consumers.""Problems with production this year have accelerated inflation in the turkey market in particular,"" CGA saidIt said some former turkey producers had got out of the business altogether, preferring to rear chickens instead.""From a turkey perspective, the vast majority of sales take place over Christmas, which has caused producers to move to a more profitable alternative in chicken,"" said Fiona Speakman, CGA's client director for food and retail.""This has been compounded by bad weather impacting egg yield, meaning that turkeys are at a premium,"" she told the BBC.Christmas ham is expected to be more expensive as well, because large numbers of pigs have been culled in an effort to halt the global spread of African Swine Fever.""The pressure on supply means whole-pig prices rose by more than 10% between March and October,"" CGA said.CGA, in association with procurement firm Prestige Purchasing, monitors wholesale food prices by compiling a monthly Foodservice Price Index.It says it has seen a ""relentless"" rise in food and drink inflation over the past three years.In the past 12 months alone, it says food and drink prices have gone up by 6.77% - more than four times the official Consumer Prices Index inflation rate of 1.5%, as measured by the Office for National Statistics.The difference suggests operators and retailers have largely absorbed the higher costs.Prestige Purchasing's chief executive, Shaun Allen, said the price rises for turkey and ham could lead to a surge in demand for other meats at Christmas, such as beef.He added: ""The increasing costs on a number of traditional Christmas dinner items will be extremely unwelcome and will put pressure on margins for both operators and retailers in order to keep the costs down for customers over the festive period.""Separate research by CGA indicates that more people are eating out during the Christmas period, with 70% of consumers visiting a restaurant over December.""Set menus and Christmas promotions often add further value to meals,"" said Ms Speakman, ""not to mention the time saved on shopping, cooking and all that washing-up."""
business	SSE sale of retail business to Ovo creates new UK energy giant		"Ovo is set to become the UK's second largest energy supplier after it agreed to buy SSE's retail business for £500m.Ovo - which was created 10 years ago - is already the UK's largest independent energy supplier, with 1.5 million customers and about 2,000 employees.But it will now take on SSE's 3.5 million customers and 8,000 staff, making it second only to British Gas.SSE said it would ""do all it can to ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees"".The deal is expected to be completed in late 2019 or early 2020.SSE - one of the Big Six energy suppliers - said there would be no immediate impact on customers after completion.It added that the SSE brand would be operated by Ovo under licence for a period, ""allowing time for a phased and carefully managed migration and continued high standards of customer service"".Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said Ovo's deal to buy SSE's business ""will enhance the ever-growing competition for customers"".""The likes of Ovo, Shell, Bulb and Octopus mean there's a base of emerging suppliers who are continuing to challenge the Big Six in the domestic energy market.""SSE had announced in May that it planned to offload its energy services division after more than 500,000 households switched to a new supplier in the year to April. The company said it would sell or float its energy services arm by the second half of 2020.In November last year, a proposed merger of SSE's household supply arm with rival Npower was called off, with SSE blaming ""very challenging market conditions"".The introduction of the energy price cap by the government had led SSE and Npower to renegotiate their planned tie-up, but they failed to agree a deal.Announcing the sale of the business to Ovo, SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""We have long believed that a dedicated, focused and independent retailer will ultimately best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders - and this is an excellent opportunity to make that happen.""I'm confident that this is the best outcome for the SSE Energy Services business.""The founder and chief executive of Ovo, Stephen Fitzpatrick, described the deal as a ""significant moment for the energy industry"".""SSE and Ovo are a great fit. They share our values on sustainability and serving customers. They've built an excellent team that I'm really looking forward to working with."""
business	Loan sharks cash in on Black Friday spending spree		"She'd not borrowed a lot. And she'd more than paid it back. Six times over.But when one mother looked up from her washing-up to see the man who'd lent her a few hundred pounds standing with her two teenage daughters, she was so frightened that she continued to pay back even more.The harrowing tale is told by Cath Williams, who heads up government agency England Illegal Money Lending Team. Her team both gives support to people who have borrowed money from a loan shark, and prosecutes the illegal money lenders.""That image was what he could do if he chose to,"" she says. ""It's psychological warfare.""In other cases, loan sharks have threatened to tell neighbours or colleagues about someone's financial problems, or taken precious wedding rings to ensure further, often unnecessary repayments.But one of the most potent pieces of emotional blackmail is specific to this time of year - that desire to spend in the Black Friday sales, or the need to buy Christmas presents.""The pressures at this time of year are extraordinary. You need your heating on, the car is more likely to break down in winter,"" says Ms Williams. ""Loan sharks will prey on that, extending loans, or giving extra time of repaying, or offering more money even if you don't want it.""This week, the sales bonanza that includes Black Friday will see Brits splurge almost £8bn online alone. It's a temptation that community groups, charities and housing associations want families to try and avoid.In Bradford, the local Credit Union has joined forces with charity Artworks to create a day of distracting crafting - with the charming Yorkshire title: ""Buy Nowt Day"".About 300 people are expected through the doors, to do something fun and creative for free, like making decorations, gifts or cards - and crucially not spending a penny under pressure.""The starting gun for Christmas is being pulled back earlier,"" says the Bradford Credit Union's financial inclusion officer Ian Brewer. ""They're feeling pressure from children, they're feeling pressure from society to spend that money earlier.""Mr Brewer insists he's not anti-business, but likens the flash sale events to a sweet shop window, and wants people to think twice and spend wisely. ""By doing this now, it's not leaving any money available for later.""Trying to point a finger of blame, or even stop the sales is fruitless. Black Friday has become crucial. A lot of shops make 25% of their annual sales in November and December - according to analysts IMRG.But this year, the figures may not even add up for the retailers, with prices already slashed since summer to tempt consumers. IMRG expect sales and revenues to be near flat.So even though retailers may have mixed feeling about the event, the sales and deals are expected, even demanded, by consumers.Allana Harrison works for Bradford's biggest social landlord, Incommunities, helping residents manage bills and budgets. Having those careful plans wrecked by a Black Friday splurge has become a common theme.""When you've got things on offer, £20 or £30 off, people are not just buying one thing, but adding others things to that basket,"" she says. ""Then they can't make their priority bills. So they're borrowing just to be able to afford Christmas presents for the children.""Nationally, across England, the Illegal Lending Team has seen a real shift in who is contacting them for support. ""It's not single mums on benefits. Last year we had over 50% of the people we helped in work,"" explains Ms Williams. ""We've got the highest number of homeowners we've ever seen.""She and her team have organised victim support for thousands of Brits, many of whom have seen families break down, or been pushed close to suicide.Often loan sharks can initially seem benign, such as coming with a friendly recommendation through a neighbour, at the school gates, or even in the workplace. Crucially there's seldom paperwork, nor clarity on what must be repaid.From Shakespeare to Dickens, the money-lenders are older than literature. And the most famous of them all, Ebenezer Scrooge, saw December as a fruitful time for business. But after a series of terrifying visits, even Scrooge changed his ways. Campaigners hope it won't take that for families."

business	Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies	Windfall taxCorporation tax	"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades.Plans to nationalise the big six energy firms, the national energy grid, the rail and water industries, the Royal Mail and the broadband arm of BT would mark the biggest ownership grab by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two.Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate will also face a corporate governance revolution.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has previously said that the group with the longest-term stake in a company is usually the workers and yet their involvement in decision-making was limited.Under Labour's plan, employees will make up one-third of reformed company boards and have an enhanced share of company profits through an Inclusive Ownership Fund, into which listed companies will transfer 1% of their shares every year for the next 10 years.Any dividends on these shares derived from UK earnings will be distributed to workers, subject to a cap of £500 a year, with any additional dividends directed to a fund to train green apprenticeships.This is a less radical proposal than the original plan to take ownership of 10% of any UK-listed company, meaning UK employees (and, above the cap, the government) would have a claim on 10% of the companies' worldwide earnings. For companies such as HSBC and Shell, that could have run to many billions.Labour will exempt those companies who already have an employee profit-sharing scheme which delivers similar benefits to those above.It seems that Labour is hoping the threat of state expropriation of shares on behalf of the workers will act as a stick to encourage companies to set up their own employee ownership schemes.The oil and gas industry will fund an £11bn scheme to retrain workers in the North Sea for jobs in lower-carbon-intensive industries.This has angered some union representatives in Scotland, who fear it will accelerate job losses in an already dwindling North Sea oil industry.How this windfall tax will be designed and applied will be the subject of a consultation and Labour has promised that oil and gas workers will not be ""hung out to dry"".People who start their own business have enjoyed preferential tax treatment in the past. That will go.The existing entrepreneurs' relief, which imposes a tax of just 10% on the capital gain when you sell a business you started, instead of 28% on other capital gains, will be abolished.Along with bringing the capital gains rate into line with a person's marginal rate of income tax, that means many entrepreneurs could face a five-fold increase in the tax they pay on any business they sell.Will that demotivate people from starting their own business?Possibly. Although I don't know many entrepreneurs who started a business simply to take advantage of entrepreneurs' tax relief.The increase in corporation tax from 19% to 26%, staggered over the next three years, is the largest source of new money for Labour, and yet I suspect it will not cause the biggest howls of outrage.After all, 19% is one of the lowest rates in the EU and there was no real clamour on the part of business for it to carry on falling to the previous government's target of 17%.Indeed, the Conservatives abandoned that plan themselves on Monday.The real howl from business will come from the cumulative effect this raft of proposals will have:Above all, the concerns of business are ideological as much as practical. This is a manifesto which seems to say that business can't be trusted to do the right thing and run itself in the interests of other stakeholders apart from its owners.Collectively, the proposals represent an attempt to drive rewards away from capital owners towards the workers.The Labour Party will tell you that business only has itself to blame that this is necessary.It describes its own proposals as ""radical"". That's one thing business will have no problem agreeing with."
business	Amazon shoe 'strikingly similar' to Allbirds model		"Amazon has been accused of creating a shoe ""strikingly similar"" to one designed by environmentally-friendly footwear manufacturer Allbirds.The shoe firm's founders, Tim Brown and Joey Zwillinger, have written an open letter to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.They said Allbirds was ""flattered"" at the similarities between the products and offered to help make Amazon's shoes ""match our approach to sustainability"".Amazon has denied infringing the US firm's designs.Allbirds woollen trainers have become trendy among celebrities, with Oprah Winfrey, Matthew McConaughey, Courteney Cox and Gwyneth Paltrow all having reportedly been seen wearing them.The firm says its shoes' carbon footprint is 60% smaller than typical synthetic shoes and that it uses less material in its packaging.The shoes that sparked the row are Amazon's 206 Collective wool blend sneakers, which Allbirds says are similar to its wool runners.Allbirds' shoes are made from New Zealand merino wool, whereas Amazon's shoes - which are for sale on its US website - are about half the price and made from a mixture of wool, polyester, nylon and viscose.The BBC has contacted Amazon for a comment, but last week the e-commerce giant told Business Insider: ""Offering products inspired by the trends to which customers are responding is a common practice across the retail industry. 206 Collective's wool blend sneakers don't infringe on Allbirds' design.""This aesthetic isn't limited to Allbirds, and similar products are also offered by several other brands.""Allbirds was founded by Mr Zwillinger and Mr Brown in 2014. The firm is now reportedly valued at more than $1bn (£777m) and has entered the British market by opening a store in London's Covent Garden.In their letter to Mr Bezos, posted on the Medium website, Mr Zwillinger and Mr Brown said: ""As we've done with over 100 other brands who were interested in implementing our renewable materials into their products, including direct competitors, we want to give you the components that would make this shoe not just look like ours, but also match our approach to sustainability.""In partnership with Braskem, we successfully created the world's first green EVA - a sustainable version of the foam used on the bottoms of sneakers (including yours), and one of the industry's most ubiquitous materials.""After all this work, we decided to give it away.

business	National Grid and SSE move offshore over Labour plans	'Highly detrimental'	"Two top energy firms say they have moved ownership of their UK operations overseas to protect themselves from Labour's nationalisation plans.In recent months, National Grid has opened offshore holding companies in Hong Kong and Luxembourg, while SSE has incorporated in Switzerland.As first reported in the Sunday Times, it would not stop them being taken over but could protect investors.Labour said the ""rip-off"" move showed the grid needed to be in public hands.In its election manifesto, the party promised a radical plan to renationalise Britain's rail, mail, water and energy networks, along with broadband.But energy companies have criticised the plan, with SSE and National Grid among those running ads on Facebook warning of the potential costs.Labour has previously said its plans would be cost neutral, help decarbonise the economy faster and create jobs.But there are fears that it would try to renationalise the companies at a discount, compared to their current market value.Critics warn this would hit shareholders, including pension funds, who would be compensated with government bonds.National Grid runs the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, as well as the main gas transmission pipelines. It has a market value of £31bn.""Labour's proposals for state ownership of National Grid would be highly detrimental to millions of ordinary people who either hold shares in the company or through their pension funds - which include several local authority pension funds,"" a spokeswoman said.""To protect their holdings, and in line with our legal fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we have established holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. This has no financial benefit to the company and does not affect its day-to-day operations,"" she added.SSE said it had moved its electricity distribution business - which supplies 3.7 million homes in Scotland and England - to a Swiss holding company. It has also moved its Scottish transmission network business.The firm, which has a market value of £13.6bn, said Switzerland was party to the Energy Charter Treaty which offered better shareholder protection.""[This is] an additional safeguard, which SSE does not believe would be required in practice, should SSE's electricity networks businesses and interests... become the subject of proposed legislation for nationalisation,"" a spokesman said.""In practice, SSE expects that precedent, the principle of fairness and the need to secure future investor confidence in the UK economy means it should be possible to secure fair value from nationalisation.""According to the Sunday Times, water company Anglian has also set up an offshore holding company. Severn Trent is said to be considering a similar move.In a statement Labour said: ""The UK's energy networks are vital strategic infrastructure on which we all rely. You cannot boil a kettle, heat your home or run a business without the grid.""The idea that private owners, who have been ripping off the public, would move offshore in an attempt to prolong the rip-off illustrates just why we need the grid back in public hands."""
business	'My Instagram got hacked and I lost my business'	'We lost 7,000 followers instantly'	"Twenty-three-year-old Bree Kotomah almost gave up on a burgeoning career in fashion design when hackers compromised her business's Instagram account in November 2018.""Unfortunately, at the time I ran everything on Instagram, so when that was gone, that was the whole business gone,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.At least half of micro businesses - companies with fewer than nine employees - in the UK are victims of cyber-attacks every year, compared to just a third of other companies, according to the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE).Ms Kotomah, whose business Boresa Kotomah is based in London, had not studied fashion. She taught herself to sew and began designing clothes in 2018.Due to interest on Twitter in her fashion styles, she started an Instagram account and gained 5,000 followers in seven months, after a photo of a dress she made went viral.Interested customers would send her a direct message on Instagram enquiring about prices, and commission her to make the dresses.Ms Kotomah would invoice her customers using PayPal and mobile app Invoice2go, and her reputation grew by word of mouth and through shares of her outfits on Instagram and Twitter.But then it all stuttered to a halt.""I woke up one morning and my account was deleted. I received an email from Instagram saying I had violated some terms and I had done certain things that I know I didn't do,"" she said.""My business at that time was my livelihood. That was what I was doing full-time. I'm self-employed. So if I'm not making money from working, I'm not making money at all so I was just thinking like, 'What am I going to do?'""Ms Kotomah was so disheartened that she stopped designing for two months and considered other jobs. But then she decided to give it one more try. She started a new Instagram account, learned more about running a business, and set up a website showcasing her work that offered ready-to-wear clothing available for immediate purchase.Ms Kotomah's designs have been worn by actors, singers, social media influencers and music artistes. Her clients include the likes of Maja Jama, Nush Cope, Ebonee Davis, Chidera Eggerue, AfroB, Labrinth, Lianne La havas, Wiz Kid and Mr Eazi.In January she set up a second Instagram profile, and eight months later she has been awarded the Young Freelancer of the Year award by the IPSE.Ms Kotomah's experience is not an isolated one - it is part of a growing trend affecting people who rely heavily on social media like Instagram to promote their businesses.Clare Vaughan runs the United Colours of Benetton clothing shop in Liverpool. Although she trades under the United Colours of Benetton brand, she owns the shop, and uses an Instagram account to promote her shop.After her Instagram account was compromised, she struggled to get Instagram to take action, and feels her reputation suffered as a result.""It was awful, absolutely awful. Seven weeks of stress when they could have just closed that page down instantly. Plus, people had lost trust in me,"" she told the BBC.""We lost 7,000 followers instantly and it's taken me from October to now [to get] almost 4,000 [new] followers.""Instagram and Facebook are really, really hard to deal with because they're an American-based company.""A spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told the BBC: ""We use sophisticated measures to stop hackers before they gain access to accounts and we are continuously working to improve our recovery process.""In the few instances hacking occurs, people can recover accounts through the app and website and we notify people if we see any unauthorised changes to an account."""

business	Uber loses licence to operate in London	Why won't Uber get a new licence?'I feel safe using Uber'Is this the end of Uber in London?What does Uber say?What do others say?Where else has banned Uber?What happened in London in 2017?	"Uber will not be granted a new licence to operate in London after repeated safety failures, Transport for London (TfL) has said.The regulator said the taxi app was not ""fit and proper"" as a licence holder, despite having made a number of positive changes to its operations.Uber initially lost its licence in 2017 but was granted two extensions, the most recent of which expires on Monday.The firm will appeal and can continue to operate during that process.London is one of Uber's top five markets globally and it has about 45,000 drivers in the city. Overall, there are 126,000 licensed private hire and black cabs in the capital.If its appeal is unsuccessful, some think Uber drivers would move over to rival ride-sharing firms such as Bolt and Kapten.""There would be competition that would fill that void quite quickly,"" Fiona Cincotta, a market analyst at City Index told the BBC.TfL said it had identified a ""pattern of failures"" in London that placed passenger safety at risk.These included a change to Uber's systems which allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts.It meant there were at least 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, TfL said.The regulator also found dismissed or suspended drivers had been able to create Uber accounts and carry passengers. In one example, a driver was able to continue working for Uber, despite the fact his private hire licence had been revoked after he was cautioned for distributing indecent images of children.Helen Chapman, director of licensing at TfL, said: ""While we recognise Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured.""London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users, but their safety is the paramount concern. Regulations are there to keep Londoners safe.""Donna Stevens says her experiences of using Uber in London have ""always been positive"".In her job as a carer she often works late, so regularly uses the service. ""The drivers are friendly, courteous and professional. I can't afford to get a metered taxi.""She says that if Uber were to go, she would probably have to go back to using public transport late at night, which does not make her feel safe.However, another reader, Kay, says she would not be sad to see Uber go.""I complained a couple of months ago about a driver who made me feel so uncomfortable I abandoned the ride and walked home in the dark at 11 o'clock at night instead of staying in his cab.""She says Uber gave her a £5 credit but did not apologise. ""How is it OK to employ drivers that make women feel unsafe?"" she says.Uber lovers in London, fear not! The company's cars will not suddenly disappear from the capital's streets.Uber is going to appeal against this decision so a magistrate will have to decide whether Uber is fit to hold a licence in London, or not.A decision from a magistrates court could take weeks or months and unless the court decides otherwise, Uber will retain its licence during this period too.When TfL decided not to renew Uber's licence in 2017, the company addressed some of the issues raised by TfL back then and then a magistrate later granted Uber a new licence.On the face of it TfL is standing tough against perceived failings by Uber. But in effect it is letting the courts decide, at a later date, whether Uber should have a licence, or not.Uber said the decision was ""extraordinary and wrong"". It said it had audited every driver in London over the past two months and strengthened its processes.Boss Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted: ""We understand we're held to a high bar, as we should be. But this TfL decision is just wrong. Over the last 2 years we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London.""According to Uber, 24% of its sales come from just five cities, including London. The others are Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco and São Paulo in Brazil.In a public filing, it said: ""Any inability to operate in London, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, would adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results.""We cannot predict whether the TfL decision, or future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions, may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing licence or permit.""Business lobby group the CBI said customers valued Uber, and encouraged both sides to find a resolution.But the Unite union - which believes Uber has unfairly taken business from black cab drivers - welcomed the news.""Uber's DNA is about driving down standards and creating a race to the bottom which is not in the best interests of professional drivers or customers,"" said Jim Kelly, chair of Unite's London and Eastern cab section.Uber has faced pressure from regulators around the world over the way it treats its drivers, competition concerns, and fears about passenger safety.The US firm pulled out of Denmark in 2017 because of new taxi laws that required drivers to have fare meters and seat sensors.Bulgaria and Hungary both stripped Uber's right to operate following pressure from local taxi unions.And in May, the ride-hailing firm pulled its UberXL service in Turkey without saying why.TfL first declined to renew Uber's licence in September 2017, again over safety concerns. Back then it cited Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences.Uber's use of secret software, called ""Greyball"", which could be used to block regulators from monitoring the app, was another factor, although Uber said it had never been used in the UK.However, TfL granted Uber a 15-month licence extension - later extended by two months - conditional on it making improvements to its business.TfL can offer licences of up to five years, but it has been more stringent of late.In July, Indian ride-hailing company Ola got a 15-month agreement for its entry into the London market, while ViaVan got a three-year licence renewal."
business	Huawei: US grants more exemptions to Chinese phone ban		"The US Commerce Department said it has agreed to grant ""several"" exemptions to its ban on doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant.The ban meant that Huawei's latest smartphones launched without many of the typical apps - including Gmail.It was not immediately clear which companies had received the licences.Officials have just started to notify firms of the government's intent to deny or approve reprieves, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.He told Fox Business that about 290 companies had requested exemptions to the ban, which the US imposed citing national security concerns in May after trade talks between the US and China broke down.Microsoft and Google are among the major technology firms that have been affected by the ban, which forbids US companies from doing business with Huawei without special approval.They did not respond to requests for comment.""The department is issuing these narrow licences to authorise limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,"" a commerce department spokesman said in a statement.The move comes amid another push for the US and China to reach a trade deal.Last month, US President Donald Trump said a ""phase one"" trade deal could be signed within weeks, but optimism has waned as the negotiations have dragged on.Mr Trump on Wednesday said China was not ""stepping up to the level that I want"".While Huawei will remain on the blacklist, the exemptions to the ban are expanding.The commerce department had already granted limited ""temporary"" licences, many of which applied to rural US telecommunications network operators. It extended those exemptions for another 90 days on Monday.The new exemptions are expected to apply to Huawei suppliers.Huawei did not respond to a request for comment immediately. The company has denied that it is a threat and urged the US to remove it from the list, arguing the ban primarily harms US companies.The US has said Huawei's equipment could be used for spying and accused the firm of violating US sanctions against doing business with Iran."
business	Oil giant BP to pull out of Alaska as sells business for $5bn	Prolific Prudhoe	"BP will no longer have any operations in Alaska after it agreed to sell its entire remaining business there to a private oil and gas firm.Hilcorp will pay $5.6bn (£4.5bn) to buy all of BP's interests in the US state.The firm has faced pressure from environmental groups to stop drilling in the area, but BP said its decision was not connected to this.""We have other opportunities that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy,"" BP's chief executive said.BP said the deal is part of its plans to raise $10bn over the next two years through asset sales to further strengthen its balance sheet.The extreme cold and remoteness of some of the drilling regions of Alaska makes it expensive for firms to operate there.BP's chief executive Bob Dudley said Hilcorp had the ability to ""maximise its [the business's] value for the State of Alaska.""Mr Dudley said the funds from the sale would enable BP to ""pursue new advantaged opportunities.""BP began working in Alaska in 1959, and in the mid-1970s helped build the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline.The Prudhoe Bay oilfield in the state - in which BP has a 26% stake - is the most prolific oil field in US history, and has produced over 13 billion barrels of oil, with forecasts suggesting it has the potential to produce more than one billion further barrels.BP said about 1,600 employees were currently associated with its Alaskan business. It said it was ""committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp.""Mr Dudley said the decision to sell its Alaskan business did not diminish its commitment to drilling in the US. ""We remain very bullish on the US energy sector... and we will continue to look at further investment opportunities here,"" he said."

If you want to work and work full-time, you have to pay for childcare.""I spoke about it with some of my female colleagues with children and they're spending anywhere between £400 and £900 a month on childcare.

business	'I kept my multimillion dollar business secret'		"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive and co-founder of US antivirus software company Malwarebytes.A lot of entrepreneurs have ""a moment"". A moment that makes them realise they're on to something.For Marcin Kleczynski it came while he was discreetly working on his antivirus software business from his student digs.His start-up company Malwarebytes was less than a year old back in late 2008, but already gaining a good reputation in the cyber security world.Marcin, then only 18, was just about managing to juggle running his start-up with participating in student life at the University of Illinois when he hit a snag.""I was having some real trouble analysing the latest computer virus, when all of a sudden I get a white page on my screen that says 'you've been banned from the school network due to malicious activity on your desktop',"" he says.""They'd obviously detected that I had a virus on my computer, but didn't realise it was deliberate. So I call the university IT helpline, and they send a kid, no older than me. He sits down at my computer and looks at it and says 'boy you've really screwed this thing up'.""Then, right in front of me, he logs onto my website and downloads Malwarebytes.""I didn't say anything, I stood behind him and watched him fix my computer with my software to get me back online. He left never knowing who I was, but to this day I love that moment.""By the time Marcin graduated with a degree in computer science in 2012, he had quietly grown Malwarebytes into a business earning a few million dollars a year. All without any of his lecturers having any idea what was taking up his time, and pushing his grades down.Today the company has an annual turnover of more than $126m, and millions of customers around the world.Born in Poland in 1989, Marcin moved to the US with his family when he was three, settling in Chicago.As a gaming-obsessed teenager, he'd accidentally got a virus when he was 14, and learned everything he needed to know about computer bugs from internet forums and a ""For Dummies"" book.Formally launching Malwarebytes in January 2008 when he was just 18, it grew quickly, and he decided that starting university in September of that year would just slow him down. His mother had other thoughts.""The business was becoming real, and so I went sheepishly to my mum and said 'I don't think I'm going to go to school',"" says Marcin. ""Fifteen seconds later we were packing my stuff and I was going to school.""What made Mrs Kleczynski initially more alarmed was that her teenage son had launched the business with a man in his 30s called Bruce Harrison. Marcin and Bruce had been writing software together for more than a year, after they first started talking on anti-virus forums.""Here's this 17-year-old kid... he's this 35-year-old man. Imagine telling your mum?..."" says Marcin.More The Boss features:Marcin and Bruce hadn't actually met in person at the time. Bruce was a computer repairman in Massachusetts, and Marcin was at home in Chicago. They didn't in fact see each other in the flesh until Malwarebytes was more than 12 months old.""We didn't meet until we made our first million about a year after we launched the product,"" says Marcin. ""Even that was kind of anti-climatic. It was just, 'Hey, Bruce!' - We had a handshake and moved on.""Today Bruce, who is head of research, still lives and works on the US east coast, while Marcin is based in the head office in Silicon Valley. The company now has more than 750 employees, and overseas offices in the Republic of Ireland, Singapore and Estonia. Since 2014 it has secured $80m of investment funding.Malwarebytes says its software now performs 187 million virus scans every month for individuals and businesses, and is installed more than 247,000 times every day. Like many antivirus companies it operates a ""freemium"" business model - the basic version is free, but you can then pay for more advanced protection.While the company has consistently grown strongly, Marcin has learned some hard lessons along the way. The most difficult time was navigating the business through an almost catastrophic period in 2014 where the product glitched on a huge scale.""We had a false positive which means we detected a piece of malicious software that wasn't actually malicious at all,"" he says.""Our software ended up mistakenly bringing down hundreds of thousands of computers. We had 911 emergency centres go down, hospitals go down, it was bad. This has happened to every anti-virus company, by the way, but these mistakes can be company killing because you lose trust.""But we fixed it and got through it. Even today, the system that we created to prevent this from happening again is called 'The Malwarebytes Extinction Prevention System' - our engineers have a great sense of humour.""Carl Gottlieb, a cyber security podcaster, says that despite operating in the ""notoriously hostile"" antivirus industry ""Malwarebytes is thriving"".""With so many competing vendors, brand awareness is key, and that step [which Malwarebytes took] to offer a free product years ago is paying dividends, with so many customers knowing the name and already using it in their homes. What Marcin and his team have achieved is impressive to see.""Still only 29, Marcin says his young age has been an advantage. He encourages other budding teen entrepreneurs to start their own business.""You've heard my story, I started the company when I was living with my parents,"" he says. ""And then even at college, it was all paid for on a student loan, so I was getting fed. If you're in college now, instead of going out and getting drunk with your friends, maybe take one night a week just to see if there's anything you want to work on personally.""He admits that his university years were harder than his friends', that he barely passed his degree, and his social life no doubt suffered. However, he's glad his mum forced him to go. ""For one thing, I met my wife there,"" he says."
business	Can you charge different customers different amounts?	More things that made the modern economy:	"""To this new manufacture, the Queen was pleased to give her name and patronage, commanding it to be called 'Queen's Ware' and honouring the inventor by appointing him her majesty's potter.""At least, that was Josiah Wedgwood's story.His biographer, Brian Dolan, reckons it's more likely Queen Charlotte's ""command"" was in fact Wedgwood's suggestion, because the potter and businessman was a shrewd individual.He was perhaps the world's first management accountant. He was a pioneering early chemist, endlessly experimenting with new ways to treat and fire clay - and noting his results in a secret code lest a rival steal his notebook.His first big breakthrough was the new kind of cream-coloured pottery - ""cream-ware""- from which he had fashioned the tea service that so impressed the Queen. It was ""quite new in its appearance"", he noted modestly and ""covered with a rich and brilliant glaze"". It quickly became known as ""Queen's Ware"".Wedgwood was also a successful lobbyist.In the 1760s, North Staffordshire potters had to despatch their fragile wares over miles of bone-shaking, pot-breaking roads to reach major cities. Wedgwood roused investors and persuaded Parliament to approve a canal connecting the Trent and the Mersey.His fellow potters were delighted, until they realised Wedgwood had cannily snapped up some prime adjacent land and built his enormous new factory right on the banks of where the canal would pass.But perhaps his most impressive achievement was solving a problem in monopoly theory 200 years before it was even articulated.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.The man who put the problem into words was a Nobel-Prize-winning economist called Ronald Coase.Imagine, said Coase, you were a monopolist, you alone produced a certain thing. Many people wanted to buy it - some would pay a lot, others much less although still enough for you to turn a profit. Ideally, you would like to charge a high price to the first group, a low price to the second.But how could you get away with that? One possible answer is to launch at a high price, then lower it to widen your market.That's what Steve Jobs tried with the first iPhone, which cost $600 (£468).After two months, he cut the price to $400 (£312). Predictably - although it apparently surprised Steve Jobs - the people who had rushed to pay $600 were less than impressed.That's why Coase argued this strategy could not work.The first set of buyers would see through the trick and realise if they only waited, they could buy the thing more cheaply.This idea is called the ""Coase conjecture"", as explained in a paper published in 1972.Back in 1772, Wedgwood was putting into words the business model that had taken shape in his mind since his meeting with the Queen and his first dabbles in management accounting.He had grasped the difference between what economists now call fixed costs, such as research and development, and variable costs, such as labour and raw materials.It initially incurred a ""great price"", he mused to his business partner, to ""make the vases esteemed ornaments for palaces"".But once he had perfected the process and trained his workers, he could churn out copies cheaply. And by this time, he mused, ""the great people have had their vases in their palaces long enough for them to be seen and admired by the middling class of people"".You can almost hear the cash registers pinging as Wedgwood writes on: ""The middling people would probably buy quantities of them at a reduced price.""He had anticipated what would later become known as the ""trickle-down"" theory of fashion: people tend to emulate those they consider above them on the social scale.Why else, for example, would the jeweller Anna Hu reportedly pay the actress Gwyneth Paltrow $1m (£820,000) to wear her diamond bracelet to the Oscars? She must have hoped to recoup the cost by inspiring purchases from the ""middling people"".Before we had Hollywood royalty there was only, well, royal royalty. In the 1760s you couldn't get much higher on the social scale than Britain's Queen - and Wedgwood's Queen's Ware gambit worked spectacularly. Sales were ""really amazing"", he wrote.The range sold at twice the price of rivals' comparable goods. And Wedgwood asked himself the key question: ""How much of this general use and estimation is owing to the mode of its introduction and how much to its real utility and beauty?""From now on, he concluded, he should bestow ""as much pains and expense"" on gaining ""royal or noble"" approval for his products as on the products themselves.But what should Josiah make next? He courted the ""virtuosi"" - wealthy art collectors who brought back pieces from their Grand Tours in Europe. And the hottest new thing, he discovered, was the Etruscan pottery being excavated in Italy. Could Wedgwood make something similar?He got to work in his laboratory with bronze powder, vitriol of iron and crude antimony, and concocted a pigment that let him imitate the Etruscan style to perfection.Aristocratic clients lapped it up: you shall ""exceed the ancients"", gushed one elderly lord, ordering three vases.And Wedgwood kept experimenting. Traditionally, clay was fired and then painted or enamelled. But Wedgwood worked out how to dye the clay with metal oxides before firing it, producing an oddly translucent effect.""Jasperware"" came in a distinctive light blue, with white decorations in relief that are still associated with the Wedgwood brand.It was another huge success. But why did Wedgwood not fall foul of the Coase conjecture?After a while, his aristocratic clients must surely have worked out that whenever Wedgwood launched something they had never seen before, they could simply wait to pick it up more cheaply.But the trickle-down theory works both ways. If people are trying to emulate their social superiors, what do you do if you're already at the top of the scale? You try, of course, to look different to the people below you.Some economists now discuss fashion as an exception to the Coase conjecture. Even if you know you'll get something cheaper if you wait a while, sometimes you still want it right now.A few years after he wowed the Queen, Wedgwood observed Queen's Ware was ""now being rendered vulgar and common everywhere"". If the great people wanted to set themselves apart from the middling people, they would have to show off their wealth and good taste by buying something new.And, happily, Wedgwood always had something new to sell them.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	Greg Clark: Business Brexit fears must be resolved	Constitutional Outrage'Huge job'	"Business confidence has seen a sharp fall since March according to the business secretary Greg Clark.He said that while companies had largely kept faith in Britain in the three years since the referendum, that faith is beginning to vanish.""In the last few months, I think since 29 of March, there are more doubts being expressed in boardrooms as to whether this is ever going to be resolved, we need to prove them wrong.""And whatever happens in this leadership election, I hope whoever is prime minister will recognise the imperative to give that confidence.""In their attempts to woo the grass roots Tory members who will decide who is our next prime minister, both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have alarmed business. Most business owners and leaders think the no-deal Brexit they are prepared to contemplate is the very last thing to encourage investment in the UK.Mr Clark knows that and last week defied Conservative party orders to vote in favour of a motion in the House of Commons that could have paved the way for parliament to be shut down at the end of October, thus preventing MPs a chance to stop a no-deal Brexit.""I couldn't support the idea that we would allow the doors of Parliament to be locked against MPs at this crucially important time. I think that would be a constitutional outrage.""Mr Clark, however, said he would not be following the example of Philip Hammond by resigning before the next Prime Minister takes office but has made clear he could not serve in an administration prepared to countenance no deal. He would not, however, vote against the government in any future vote of confidence.""I have always been a loyal Conservative MP, I was elected as a conservative Member of Parliament. And I will always support a Conservative government that I've been elected to. The ballot paper had my name on it but it also had the name of the Conservative Party. That is very important.""Mr Clark's time in office has been overshadowed by Brexit uncertainty but he celebrated an early success when he persuaded Nissan to invest in its Sunderland plant shortly after the referendum.He told the BBC that he had inherited the trip to Japan from his predecessor Sajid Javid and was disturbed to find that Nissan was thinking of scaling back its Sunderland plant.""When I went there, it became apparent to me that Nissan was about to make an investment decision around Sunderland, that was set to go the wrong way, and could have resulted in thousands of jobs going because Brexit was a particular concern.""So right from the outset - on Brexit - it became a big part of my job to try and give confidence to investors in this country and around the world to keep faith.""That is becoming a much harder job according to Mr Clark with both candidates to be new leader - Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson - declaring themselves prepared to leave the EU without a deal.Mr Clark said there was a ""huge gulf"" in the minds of business between leaving with or without a deal and that promising to leave at the end of October, come what may, was a mistake.""You have to do everything you can to have a deal. And so I think that the setting of a hard deadline - even if a deal was tantalisingly within reach - I think would be the wrong thing to do.""Mr Clark admits privately he knows that his career as business secretary will be over very shortly. He still has several pots boiling on the hob. He has put in thousands of air miles trying to find a saviour for Scunthorpe-based British Steel. That mission has taken him to China, India and Turkey in the last few weeks. He seems optimistic that a buyer can be found but knows he won't be the one announcing it.Mr Clark is popular among business leaders. They recognise someone who understands how they operate and what they need. That has been important at a time when business chiefs felt the current prime minister and the favourite to succeed her have not had the same relationship with industry as previous conservative governments.Mr Clark likes being business secretary. He still talks with genuine excitement at the massive technological changes that are changing the ways we live and work and you can sense genuine passion that the UK gets its share of investment.He points out that many of the industries experiencing the most fundamental change - automotive, aerospace, life sciences, green technology - are things the UK is very good at.Mr Clark has never been a politician to set the pulse racing but he's hard working, principled and detail orientated.It is impossible to instill confidence while Brexit continues to hang over the UK. Once that is settled, what business will need most of all from the next prime minister is the sense that the government is on its side.Most industry leaders believed Mr Clark was rooting for them by railing against the possibility of leaving with no deal. A position which which made him few friends on the right of the party.Mr Clark's own assessment of his time in office would probably be something like ""I did OK - under the circumstances."""
business	SSE in talks with Ovo over sale of UK energy business	'Long-term future'Earnings hit	"Energy company SSE, which supplies almost six million UK households, says it is negotiating the sale of its energy retail business to Ovo Group.But it says no decision has been made by the two firms on finalising a deal.If a deal is reached, Ovo will become one of the UK's largest energy firms, having been founded just 10 years ago.In May, SSE announced plans to offload its energy services division after more than 500,000 households switched to a new supplier in the year to April.SSE - one of the so-called Big Six energy suppliers - said it would sell or float its energy services arm by the second half of 2020.""These discussions are continuing, however no final decisions have been taken and no agreements regarding the terms of any transaction have been entered into,"" it said.""The board remains focused on securing the best long-term future for the business, its customers and employees, and for shareholders.""Ovo declined to comment on the SSE statement.USwitch energy expert Sarah Broomfield said: ""SSE have been looking for a fresh start for their retail energy business for the best part of two years.""If this deal does materialise, Ovo may well bring a different feel to what SSE customers have traditionally been used to, as one of the companies at the forefront of new technologies such as smart meters and electric vehicles.""But households affected would likely be most concerned with the price they're paying and the service they're getting.""If a deal goes ahead it would see SSE's 5.8 million domestic customers added to Ovo's 1.5 million, making it second only to British Gas, which has 12 million domestic accounts.SSE has previously said its wider business ""fell well short"" of its expectations in 2018-19 and has warned 2019-20 earnings will also be hit.Last November a proposed merger of its household supply arm with rival Npower was called off with SSE blaming ""very challenging market conditions"".The energy firm was also fined £700,000 by Ofgem in April for missing last year's target to install gas smart meters for customers."
business	Louis Vuitton buys jeweller Tiffany for $16bn		"The world's biggest luxury goods company is buying US-based jeweller Tiffany & Co for more than $16bn (£12.5bn).The largest luxury goods deal to date gives LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault a bigger slice of one of the fastest growing upmarket sectors.He said Tiffany had an ""unparalleled heritage"" and fitted with his other brands.Tiffany has been hit by lower spending by tourists and a strong US dollar.Tiffany is something of a New York institution and its flagship store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. The company hit global fame after being featured in the 1961 Audrey Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's.Founded in 1837, it employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores - 12 of them in the UK.Mr Arnault has coveted the business since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn.""We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons [brand houses],"" he said.LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Its other brands include Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom Pérignon, Moet & Chandon, and Christian Dior.""We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come,"" Mr Arnault said.Known for its signature robin's-egg blue packaging, Tiffany rebuffed LVMH's initial advance made just five weeks ago, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.The new deal values each Tiffany share at $135 in cash and is higher than the initial offer of $120 a share - which valued the business at $14.5bn.Tiffany chairman Roger Farah said the board had concluded this deal ""provides an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates and will invest in Tiffany's unique assets and strong human capital"".The brand is associated with diamond rings but it has lost its appeal in recent years, according to Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index.She told the BBC's Today programme that there had been a ""changing of the times"".""It's not quite keeping up with millennials so it just needs a re-boost and a re-brand,"" she said.LVMH has experience of revitalising businesses. Ms Cincotta cited jeweller Bulgari, which when LVMH took it over in 2011 had operating margins of 8%. These have now widened to 25% on double the sales.""This something that LVMH appears to do very well... this is a real turnaround story,"" Ms Cincotta said.Step through the doors of the Tiffany & Co flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York and you go back in time to the 1960s.You don't quite expect Audrey Hepburn to be gazing longingly at one of the glass display cases, but the shop's atmosphere is redolent of the eponymous film that did so much to make the jewellery chain an international name.That ready association is an asset - everyone knows what Tiffany does - but is also a weakness.Millennials don't want to shop where their parents did, which is why Tiffany has been struggling in recent years and has now given up the fight to remain an independent company.LVMH is paying a decent price - $135 a share is not far off its all-time high - but it's worth bearing in mind that luxury brands are notoriously difficult to value. Tiffany's staff will be hoping that LVMH can repeat what it did with Bulgari, turning a rather old-fashioned brand into something more cutting edge, and doubling sales in the process.Investment bankers, ever eager for the sniff of a deal, will also be wondering whether this move by LVMH might trigger a reshuffle of its sprawling empire.One obvious deal - which has been touted many times but never made it off the drawing board - would be the sale of its majority holding in Moet-Hennessy to Diageo, the drinks giant that currently owns a one-third share. Diageo would be an eager buyer, but over the years LVMH has shown itself reluctant to sell.Tiffany has attempted to broaden its appeal to younger customers.Last year, actor Elle Fanning was named as the face of the brand and fronted an advertising campaign to the strains of Moon River - the theme tune to the film Breakfast at Tiffany's - but remixed and featuring the rapper A$AP Ferg.It also secured Kendall Jenner, one of the biggest ""influencers"" on Instagram with 119 million followers, as one of the models for this year's spring and summer collection.In 2018, it brought in Reed Krakoff, widely credited for transforming the US handbag brand Coach into a multi-billion dollar business, as its chief artistic officer.One of his first collections when he joined Tiffany was called ""Everyday Objects"" and features products such as a sterling silver ball of yarn for £8,750 and a set of 10 Lego-like silver and walnut building blocks which cost £1,550.Its main focus, though, is jewellery which was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018. Consultancy Bain & Co forecast that comparable sales in the $20bn global market were expected to rise by 7% this year.This has encouraged firms to expand in the sector. Luxury goods firm Kering has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci, while Switzerland's Richemont - a sector leader with labels such as Cartier - recently bought Italy's Buccellati."
business	UK banknote printer De La Rue fears for its future	What is De la Rue?'Teetering on the brink'	"De La Rue, the company that prints the UK's banknotes, has said there is a risk that the firm will collapse if its turnaround plan fails to work.The announcement came as it suspended its dividend and reported a loss in the first half of its financial year.De La Rue said its warning was based on a worst-case scenario.However, it concluded that there was ""a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the group's ability to operate as a going concern"".UK-based De La Rue prints cash for about 140 central banks and employs more than 2,500 people globally.All current Bank of England banknotes are printed by the firm at a site in Debden, Essex.It is unclear what would happen if the firm got into difficulties, but it is likely that a rival would take over its Bank of England contract. Its main competitors are all based outside the UK.The BBC understands that preparations have already been made for the launch of the new £20 note featuring artist JMW Turner, printed by De La Rue, which enters circulation on 20 February next year.Shares in De la Rue fell 20% on Tuesday morning.De La Rue has faced some big setbacks in the past two years, including the loss of the post-Brexit UK passport printing contract to a Franco-Dutch firm last year.In May last year, it had to write off £18m after Venezuela's central bank failed to pay its bills.The company is also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with ""suspected corruption"" in South Sudan.It appointed a new chief executive, Clive Vacher, in October as part of a management shake-up.Around 11% of the 171 billion banknotes issued globally in 2017 were printed by a handful of commercial printers. De La Rue is now the largest of these firms.It began producing banknotes in 1860, first for Mauritius and then elsewhere. Today it produces enough notes each week that if stacked up would reach the peak of Everest twice.Its main competitor, German company Giesecke & Devrient, produces notes for roughly 100 central banks, while the Canadian Banknote Company and US-founded Crane Currency are also major players.De La Rue reported a £12.1m pre-tax loss for the six months to 28 September, compared with a £7.1m profit in the same period last year.In its results statement, the company said it was accelerating its restructuring plan, including a reduction in overhead costs.It is also planning new banknote security feature products to bolster its position in the ""increasingly competitive"" banknote market.""De La Rue is teetering on the brink,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.""Bad management and decisions seems to be the main reason for the malaise.""Investors sometimes wonder whether a company's board of directors can, in the short term, have much sway over a company's trading.The scepticism is warranted: boards normally comprise a small number of executives and a larger number of non-executive directors, who have no involvement with day-to-day operations, and there are plenty of examples of companies going off the rails without the board suspecting anything was wrong.Today's results from De La Rue show, however, that boards are vital. The banknote and secure-printing company turned in a disastrous set of numbers - a £10m operating loss, a string of one-off charges and mounting debt - which it blamed on falling demand and too many companies chasing too few contracts.But it also admits that a period of unprecedented turmoil at the top has not helped, with the chairman, chief executive, finance director and most of the other directors changing in short order.""The board believes that significant changes in the board and executive teams, along with a restructuring of the business, has contributed to the poor performance of the business in the period,"" the results statement says.""This has contributed to a larger variance between forecasts and performance than has been experienced historically.""Management matters, and will matter even more in the next few months. The directors warn that if the revival plan put in place by (newish) chief executive Clive Vacher does not yield results, there is a threat to the company being able to continue as a going concern.In plain English, that means it will have to find more money, either by renegotiating the terms of its bank loans or by asking shareholders to stump up more cash."
business	New warning on global economic slowdown		"A leading international economic organisation has warned that risks to the global outlook have increased.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - the OECD - says in a new report that prospects have steadily deteriorated.It forecasts continued growth of around 3% but warns that the risks have increased.The report says a lack of direction on climate policy is holding back business investment.Although the OECD is not forecasting a recession, it is a decidedly downbeat report.There are calls for action from governments to address challenges, some of which have both long term and more immediate consequences.Climate change is perhaps the most striking example.The OECD says extreme weather events could lead to disruption of economic activity and could inflict long lasting damage on capital and land. They could also lead to what the report calls disorderly migration flows.Insufficient policy action could increase the frequency of such events.There is clearly a long term challenge for governments in addressing these issues, but the OECD says that there is already an impact on business investment.In many countries it is investment and trade that has been at the centre of weakening economic performance.It says governments must act quickly.""Without a clear sense of direction on carbon prices, standards and regulation, and without the necessary public investment, businesses will put off investment decisions, with dire consequences for growth and employment,"" the OECD says.The report argues that more clarity on climate policy - and also on digitalisation - would trigger a marked acceleration of investment by business.It suggests the creation of national funds to make public investments in these areas.Among the other challenges that the OECD mentions is the change in the Chinese economy, it is becoming a more services-oriented economy which means the country's demand for imported goods for its industries to process is unlikely to grow as strongly in the future.Along with the shift in the shape of the Chinese economy, there has also been a gradual slowdown in the rate of growth since the start of the decade. For the previous thirty years, the economy had grown at a rate that the Chinese government accepted could no longer be sustained.China is trying to ensure it is not too abrupt a slowdown. The possibility that it might not succeed is something the OECD identifies as a risk to the global economy."
business	Car production 'could plummet in no-deal Brexit'		"UK car production could be cut by more than a third if the UK withdraws from the EU without an ""ambitious"" trade deal, an industry body has warned.Analysis commissioned by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) predicts that falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would add £3.2bn a year to car making costs.Car prices would rise and annual output could fall to as little as one million by 2024, the data by AutoAnalysis said.The UK made 1.52 million cars in 2018.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said falling back on WTO rules for imported components and car exports would result in a level of cost increases that the industry would not be able to absorb without prices rises and production cuts.He used the body's annual dinner on Tuesday to call for an ""ambitious, world-beating Brexit trade deal to maintain the sector's competitiveness and ability to deliver innovation, productivity and prosperity for Britain"".Mr Hawes said the industry needs ""frictionless trade free of tariffs, with regulatory alignment and continued access to talent"".He went on: ""A close trading relationship is essential to unlock investment so we can deliver our goals: cleaner air, zero carbon emissions, and the ability to go on building our products and marketing them globally.""Rather than producing two million cars a year by 2020, a no trade deal, WTO tariff worst case scenario could see us making just a million,"" he said. He predicted that production of new models that would have been made in the UK could be moved ""to more competitive and welcoming production locations"".UK car manufacturing has already seen its weakest first nine months of a year since 2011, falling by 15.6% year-on-year. Honda and Ford have announced plant closures this year but both blamed factors other than Brexit.Peugeot has said a decision to keep open its Vauxhall car factory in the UK is dependent on the final terms of Brexit.Mr Hawes said automotive was one of the UK's most valuable economic assets, directly responsible for putting food on the tables of 168,000 British workers and their families.""The next government must deliver the ambition, the competitive business environment and the commitment needed to keep automotive in Britain,"" he said."
business	How social media could ruin your business	'Dropping a bomb'Stealing your good name'Planning is crucial'Employee activityPasswords and postsTake advantage of social monitoring tech	"Whether it comes from hackers, disgruntled customers, or is simply a backlash against something you post, negative social media content can destroy trust in your brand in a matter of minutes.""Social media is the most immediate threat to your company's reputation,"" says Pete Knott, digital consultant at reputation management consultancy Lansons.""If not taken seriously it can and will directly impact your company financially and culturally.""Fake news remains one of the biggest challenges - despite machine learning crackdowns by networks such as Facebook and Twitter.In May, for example, shares in the UK's Metro Bank plunged 11% before it could shake off inaccurate social media rumours that it was facing financial difficulties.And according to Ilia Kolochenko of Geneva-based internet security company Immuniweb, the consequences could potentially be much worse.""Hackers can cause huge damage if they can find a way to post fake news on social media,"" he says.""Imagine if they managed to hack into the BBC accounts and post a story about Iran dropping a nuclear bomb.""The effects could be devastating - especially if other news networks picked up the story.""Social media posts don't have to be inaccurate to damage your brand, though. Sometimes, the truth hurts too.In 2016, battery manufacturer Samsung SDI's market value plummeted by more than half a billion dollars when Tesla boss Elon Musk tweeted that the company was working with Panasonic on its next electric car.If not properly thought out, your own posts can also cause problems, as US bank Chase found out earlier this year when it was accused of ""poor shaming"". It published a post suggesting customers with low bank balances save money by avoiding taking cabs and buying coffees.Other threats include fraudsters taking your brand name in vain.""Creative crooks often exploit big companies' names to run social media scams,"" Mr Kolochenko says.""For example, they might set up an 'Amazon India Support' account on Twitter and ask customers who contact them about missing parcels to pay a customs fee.""And even posts by unknown customers can do a lot of damage if other users pick them up.""Consumers have recognised that social media is a very fast way to get a response from customer services,"" says Claire Twohill, social media director at global PR agency FleishmanHillard.""That's why social media attacks are often a direct result of a problem with the supply chain, or a change to a popular product.""But whatever the reason, you need to react fast.""Masha Maksimava, a vice president at Belorussian social monitoring company Awario, says: ""The key to online reputation management is handling negative feedback quickly to prevent it turning into crisis.""So it pays to be properly prepared.""Planning is crucial,"" says Lopa Ghosh, an associate partner at global professional services provider EY.Equally important, however, is not to overreact.""You don't need to jump on every negative tweet,"" Ms Twohill says.""Sometimes it's better to do nothing to avoid creating a crisis for no reason.""Either way, finding the right tone is key.Get it spot on, and you might even be able to turn events to your favour.""Social networks are a great place to rebuild reputation,"" Mr Knott says.""So try to think about how you can use your response to a crisis to demonstrate your company's values and show its human side.""Employee activity is one of the biggest social media pitfalls.Cyber criminals, for example, often use information gleaned from employees' social accounts to infiltrate an organisation.Richard Horne, a cyber security partner at accountants PwC, says: ""People expose a lot about themselves on social media.""So attackers could look at someone's profile, see they love skiing and email them a malware link to a cheap chalet deal in Switzerland.""It's a very common way of infecting companies' systems.""The challenge, therefore, is to manage how your employees use social media, without impinging on their rights.""You can't monitor your employees' social media accounts - that's getting into very ethically murky waters,"" says Ms Ghosh.""Instead, you have to educate them about passwords and what sort of thing they post.""It's also important to be clear about how they should respond - if at all - if the company becomes embroiled in a crisis.More Technology of BusinessEmma Harvey, founder of London-based reputation management specialist Seven Consultancy, says: ""If an incident occurs, ensure that employees understand the protocol, and are not fanning the flames themselves by trying to defend the company online.""Monitoring, or listening, tools that use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by social networks to collect and analyse data can help you to build reputation and manage crises on social media.""Setting up a social listening tool can be challenging, especially if your brand name is a common word such as Apple,"" Ms Maksimava says.""So the main three things to look for are sentiment analysis, so you can handle negative mentions first; real-time results, so you can step in immediately; and flexibility, so you can exclude irrelevant mentions even if your keywords are ambiguous.""Just be careful to avoid invading people's privacy.""There are definite benefits to using social listening tools, but it must be done in the right way,"" Mr Knott says."
business	WeWork axes 2,400 staff globally		"Office rental company WeWork is cutting about 2,400 jobs globally in an effort to staunch its growing losses.The move follows the dramatic collapse of WeWork's plans to raise money by listing shares on the stock market.WeWork called the cuts ""necessary"" in order to ""create a more efficient organisation"".The company lost nearly $1bn (£775m) in the first half of the year and had faced questions about its finances and governance.Co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as chief executive this autumn. Under his leadership, the firm had invested in projects of personal interest, including a school and a firm that makes artificial waves.WeWork's new bosses had warned staff last month to expect cuts as the firm refocused on its ""core"" business of renting office space.""As part of our renewed focus on the core WeWork business, and as we have previously shared with employees, the company is making necessary layoffs to create a more efficient organisation,"" WeWork said in a statement.WeWork said the reductions began ""weeks ago"" overseas and are now affecting the US. Globally, about 2,400 people are affected.WeWork, which rents office space to freelancers and businesses, expanded rapidly from a single office in New York to more than 500 locations around the world. It had about 12,500 employees at the end of June.Softbank, WeWork's biggest backer, valued it at nearly $47bn at the start of the year, but the Japanese investment company has since been forced write down that figure to about $8bn.The drop helped to drive Softbank to its first quarterly loss in 14 years and prompted chief executive Masayoshi Son to say that his ""judgement around WeWork was not right in many ways""."
business	Thomas Cook's new owner creates 1,500 new jobs		"Hays Travel, which bought Thomas Cook after it collapsed, has announced plans to hire an extra 1,500 staff.The travel agent has already taken on 2,330 former Thomas Cook employees.But now Hays plans to hire another 200 people at its head office in Sunderland, an extra 500 to handle foreign exchange, and an apprentice at each of its 737 branches.The move has been seen as a vote of confidence in the package holiday market.Hays took on all of Thomas Cook's 555 shops in October after the travel agent spectacularly collapsed earlier this year.Since then it has reopened 450 of those stores and hired a lot of its old staff.But now it is expanding further.John Hays, who runs the travel agent with his wife Irene, said: ""We're further increasing staffing to ensure we have the highest customer service levels across all of our stores and our head office functions.""He said applicants didn't need experience in the sector ""just an enthusiasm for travel"".The hiring spree will take Hays' workforce to 5,700 people.""The former Thomas Cook managers have said the biggest difference for them is being empowered and valued - as an independent travel agent they are not tied to certain products or scripts and they feel trusted,"" Mr Hays said.""This is a key principle of our business.""It is the latest sign of renewed confidence in the package holiday business.Earlier this week, EasyJet announced plans to relaunch its own package holiday operation in a bid to fill the gap in the market left by Thomas Cook.About 20 million people fly with EasyJet to Europe annually but only 500,000 book accommodation through it."
business	The 'monsoon' rain hitting UK business	Washout	"""We had monsoon conditions at the start"", says Nina Barbour.For many British businesses, this long spell of wet weather has been challenging and costly.Nina Barbour is director of Bolesworth Estate, where one of the country's biggest equestrian events went ahead last week - but was closed to the public.""The financial implications of this are huge,"" she tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme.""We rely on sponsorship to the tune of about £300,000, trade stands to half that value, and of course the public admission,"" she says, adding that all ticket holders and non-specialist traders had now been refunded.""Our biggest worry is keeping the animals safe and dry. We have up to 800 horses on-site, in temporary stabling,"" Ms Barbour adds.It's been a week of almost continuous rain across parts of the UK, and that's not good news for many businesses.By the middle of June, England and Wales had already had more than the average amount of monthly rainfall, and that could be affecting customer behaviour.Data from retail monitor Springboard suggests that the number of people visiting the shops is down more than 5% compared to the same time in 2018.Parts of Lincolnshire flooded this week and are still under water - nearly 600 homes have been evacuated there.But not everyone is affected. Scotland has received just over half its normal June rainfall in the first half of the month, the Met Office said.'Festival nightmare'Chaotic scenes of festival-goers caked in mud are as synonymous with the erratic British summer as strawberries and cream.Paul Reed, chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals, which represents 65 events around the UK, tells the BBC that running a festival ""is already quite a risky business model.""Add extreme weather to the mix and it becomes ""a nightmare"", he says.'Only a certain threshold for discomfort'In July 2018 Camp Bestival was cancelled because of high winds and rain, while a particularly rain-drenched Festival No.6 led to hundreds of cars getting stuck in a muddy car park and large scale compensation claims as a result.And music fans left this year's Download festival after torrential rain reduced the site to a ""mud-bath"".""People only have a certain threshold for discomfort,"" Mr Reed tells the BBC.""There's the knock-on effect of that... insurance premiums are going up, and then dealing with the fallout, with festival-goers, refunds, trying to restore public confidence.""Underwriters are getting a lot more nervous with every cancellation - understandably,"" he says.Why has it been so wet?Analysis: BBC Weather presenter Simon KingWe've got a spell of drier weather over the next few days. Looking at the short-term forecast, while there'll be some drier and warmer spells, there are no signs of any prolonged dry, warm and sunny conditions.The weather in the UK is defined by its pressure pattern.Last year we just had higher pressure consistently across the UK for three or four weeks whereas so far, this June, it's been dominated by low pressure and that brings us the wetter and cooler weather.Some places have had three times their month's worth of rainfall in the space of seven days.Small businesses have felt the effects too. But Georgia Duffy, who owns a bookshop in Harrogate, finds that while the recent rainy spell has caused a drop in customer visits - particularly from tourists - retail has other problems that ""are not just as simple as the weather"".""Sometimes, with the rain, we have people coming in for reading material because they're not going for days out,"" she said.Georgia Duffy made headlines last June when she tweeted that her business had had ""the worst day ever"" for sales.Louise Stewart from the Federation of Small Businesses said firms ""need to be more resilient"" to the wet weather.""They should be looking at having a resilience plan in place,"" she told the BBC.A resilience plan looks at the the potential impact of severe weather on different parts of a business, including its supply chain; flood risk; and flexible working options for staff.Does weather like this affect the economy?First there was the Beast from the East in 2018, then the joint hottest summer on record, and then winter temperatures in February 2019 soared to all-time highs.The Beast hit the UK's construction sector, fuel sales and high street shopping. Many of us stayed in, turned up the heating and shopped online.Retail footfall figures also fluctuate and can be affected by the weather.There was a big fall when this latest spell of wet weather started, before picking up towards the end of the week when conditions improved. Footfall last week was 1% lower than the week before when the weather was drier.On the other hand, unexpectedly hot weather may boost customer confidence, but it can be damaging too.Following the heatwave last June and July, energy company SSE warned that its first-quarter profits would be £80m lower than expected after household demand for energy fell and a lack of wind affected its turbines.And Superdry blamed poor performance at the end of 2018 on unseasonably warm weather conditions that made it harder to shift winter clothes."
business	Uber: Three views on the loss of its London licence	Rachel Wilkinson, a passengerKay, a passengerMuhammad Ali, a driver	"On Monday, London's transport authority told taxi hailing firm Uber it would not extend its licence to operate in the capital.The firm said it would appeal against Transport for London's (TfL) decision, the latest twist in two years of friction between Uber and the local government.In 2017, Uber also lost its licence, until it won an appeal. It then received a two-month licence in September, which lapsed on Sunday. Users will still be able to use the service while Uber appeals.Uber branded the move as ""extraordinary and wrong"", while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, and that ""safety is the paramount concern"".The BBC spoke to three London-based customers and drivers about their experiences with the firm.Uber ""was especially important to me when I broke my leg and relied on it to transport me everywhere. Without Uber I would not have gone out at all and would have been miserable,"" says Rachel Wilkinson, who works in business research.She says she feels for those with mobility problems who might be more permanently reliant on hiring cars, especially when the alternative is pricier private hires and black cabs. ""Uber genuinely was a lifeline,"" she said.Ms Wilkinson says she feels more pressure should be put on TfL to modernise black cabs with the same information available to Uber passengers, and to make them cheaper.""I do want to make sure I'm driving with someone secure and safe,"" she says, adding that Uber should monitor and assess drivers.The service has allowed her to ditch her car. ""Instead of wasting money on a car I only used at weekends, paying crazy parking and congestion charges and clogging up the roads, Uber allows me to use a car when I need to and not worry about it the rest of the time.""I'd have thought that given the insane congestion in London, this would a positive thing for the local government too.""Kay, who didn't want to give her surname, said her experience with Uber wasn't good. She had used the app for about five years until she had an experience that made her uncomfortable enough to abandon her ride.""I am sad for the genuine drivers who will lose their jobs,"" she said. ""But Uber itself? No.""She says that after what turned into a disagreement about the route, her driver ignored one of her directions, driving quickly past her turn, and she chose to end the ride.When she complained, Uber offered her £5. She gave the driver a one star review on the app - the worst possible - after which her driver complained about her. The company threatened to suspend her account.There were no apologies for having been made to feel so uncomfortable, she said. ""I was forced, late at night, to abandon the ride... Don't worry about banning my account [Uber]. I won't be using you again anyway. I don't think they take complaints seriously enough,"" she said.An Uber spokeswoman said: ""We take all reports of this nature very seriously and investigate thoroughly. We typically prevent drivers from using the app during investigations and if the allegations prove true, an individual would likely face permanent deactivation. We work closely with the police to assist with any investigation.""""I knew it was going to happen,"" says Muhammad Ali, who has been driving for Uber for nine months after a 19-year private hire career. He says he feels that TfL care more about drivers of London's black cabs.He says he was shocked about the news of so many unlicensed trips, but believes Uber is a good company to work for. ""I know how this business works,"" he says. ""I think they are driver-friendly.""He says not having to handle cash is a big boon for him as a driver, together with all the other things the Uber software takes care of.This includes the jobs that a human operator would normally be in charge of, such as allocating good routes.""This is the only company I work for. It is my full-time job. If Uber loses its licence I'll be out of a job,"" he says. That said, he certainly feels that Uber ""should get their house in order sort out all the issues TfL have pointed out""."
business	Manchester City investment from US breaks global sports valuation	'Premium sports content'Manchester rivalryMedia rights	"The parent company of Premier League champions Manchester City has announced a £389m investment from US private equity firm Silver Lake.The deal breaks a record in global sports valuations, making holding company City Football Group (CFG) worth £3.73bn ($4.8bn).The US private equity firm is buying around 10% of CFG's worldwide business.City are currently third in the Premier League, and have qualified for the Champions League last 16.CFG has a stake in seven football clubs across the world, including in the US, Australia, Japan and China.Group chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: ""We and Silver Lake share the strong belief in the opportunities being presented by the convergence of entertainment, sports and technology and the resulting ability for CFG to generate long-term growth and new revenue streams globally.""Silver Lake, which is best known for technology investing, said its investment would ""help drive the next phase of CFG's growth in the fast-growing premium sports and entertainment content market"".Egon Durban, managing director of Silver Lake, will represent the US backers on the CFG board as part of the deal, first reported in the FT.Earlier this year Joe Tsai, co-founder of China's online giant Alibaba, bought a controlling share in the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, which gave it a $2.35bn valuation, the highest for a US sports team.Earlier in November, Manchester City announced it had brought in a record £535.2m last season.It was City's 11th successive year of revenue growth and closed the gap on local rivals Manchester United, the Premier League's richest club.The figure is projected to rise again next year given Man City have qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League.Payments from a £45m-a-year Puma kit deal will also start to take effect.Will Walker-Arnott, senior investment manager at Charles Stanley, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""Silver Lake is a US private equity firm which is better known for investing in technology stocks such as Alibaba and Skype.""But more recently it has been getting into sports rights and got invested in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.""He says the firm has probably been drawn to Manchester City because of its lucrative media rights.""We've got a lot of large broadcasting firms like BT, Sky and Amazon all bidding for [Premier League football] rights,"" he said.There is one ""question mark"" hanging over the lofty valuation, however.""Manchester City are being investigated by Uefa for possible breaches into financial fair play, so [Silver Lake] are obviously looking over that,"" Mr Walker-Arnott said.Earlier this month the club's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) asking for Uefa's probe to be halted, was rejected.The club is at risk of being banned from the Champions League and will now face judgement from Uefa's adjudicatory chamber."
business	Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan		"This is a radical attempt to change Britain's business model, involving not just huge amounts of public spending and investment, but also an attempt to rewire the way the economy works.Labour's answer to ""can we afford this?"" is ""we can't afford not to"" - arguing that only a very active government can reshape the economy to change the fate of the country, in particular to meet the green challenge.Labour is part of a now-shared consensus across every single party, the IMF and finance ministries across the world, that currently low interest rates charged on government borrowing should be used to fund substantial investments.Labour has used this opportunity to push the radicalism of its 2017 manifesto much further with about £140bn extra in spending a year, versus for example £80bn a year from the LibDems, and tens of billions from the Conservatives.It leaves all the major parties promising voters hundreds of billions over the Parliament. At around £600bn more in spending promises over the five years Labour has put clear blue water between themselves and the extra spending of the other major parties.Is this affordable? It is more risky than more-modest spending plans.It is true that there is an appetite for cheap borrowing by governments, and that could stretch to 2-3% of GDP on investment spending implied by Labour's plans.But with a backdrop of concern from international investors on their stakes in utilities being nationalised, and new and much higher taxes on wealth, share trades, and the rich, the Labour plans risk pushing up the cheap borrowing rates they are relying on.Labour's answer: It is an even bigger risk not to borrow to invest in the transformation of the economy.The day-to-day spending plans are bigger than in 2017, at £83bn a year by the end of the Parliament, providing funding for schools, sure start, scrapping tuition fees, health and social care, and public sector pay.That is matched by tax rises on the wealthy and companies. These are huge sums which indirectly will surely be felt well beyond the super-rich and wealthy business owners.Stepping corporation tax back up to 26% is the biggest single measure, but applying income tax rates to capital gains (taxing your shares and assets) is a huge measure - raising £14bn, and catches more than just the richest 5% in its net.Labour's planned corporation tax revenues would be the highest in the developed world. The size of the state in terms of spending would be the highest outside of a crisis since the 1970s, although that also would mean it would be about the same size as Germany.So a big change for Britain, a transformation of the business model that we're used to here, but not wildly out of kilter with other developed economies that have retained a strong state."
business	Brexit uncertainty 'hitting UK business investment'	'Deteriorating outlook'	"Brexit worries will see business investment contract faster this year and recover more slowly next year than was previously thought, a report says.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says firms are putting resources into contingency plans, such as stockpiling, in a way that is ""not sustainable"".It says companies should be investing in measures aimed at economic growth.The BCC growth forecast for 2019 was slightly upgraded, driven by the ""rapid"" stock-piling earlier this year.But it said that growth would be more subdued in 2020 and 2021.Its growth expectations for the UK in 2019 is now 1.3%, from 1.2%. But it has downgraded its growth forecast for 2020 to 1.0%, from 1.3%, and to 1.2%, from 1.4%, in 2021.The BCC said continued Brexit uncertainty, including the growing possibility of a no-deal, was expected to ""suffocate"" investment activity in the short term.""Businesses are putting resources into contingency plans, such as stockpiling, rather than investing in ventures that would positively contribute to long-term economic growth,"" it said.The new BCC growth forecasts assume that the UK avoids a ""messy and disorderly"" exit from the EU.""The revisions to our forecast suggest that the UK economy is likely to remain on a disappointingly subdued growth path for some time to come,"" said BCC head of economics Suren Thiru.""The downward pressure on business activity and investment intentions from the unwinding of stocks is likely to be exacerbated by increasing cost pressures and Brexit uncertainty, slowing overall economic growth across the forecast period.""The deteriorating outlook for business investment is a key concern as it limits the UK's productivity potential and long-term growth prospects.""And he warned leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal or transition period remained the main risk to the UK's economic future.""The disruption caused would increase the likelihood of the UK's weak growth trajectory translating into a more pronounced deterioration in economic conditions,"" he said."
business	Alibaba shares jump in blockbuster Hong Kong debut	Protests weigh on economy	"Shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba have surged in its Hong Kong trading debut in one of the year's most anticipated stock offerings.The firm, which is already traded in the US, raised around $11.3bn (£8.8bn) in its secondary listing.At the launch, Chairman Daniel Zhang cheered Alibaba's return to Hong Kong.The move is seen as a boost for the city amid fears long-running protests have tarnished its reputation as a financial hub.In opening moves on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index on Tuesday, Alibaba's stock jumped more than 6%.The company was met with strong appetite for its shares, priced at HK$176 each.Mr Zhang struck the gong at the ceremony at the city's exchange and welcomed the firm's return ""home"" to Hong Kong.He was joined by the territory's Financial Secretary Paul Chan and former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa.The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory.Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence.Ahead of its Hong Kong debut, the company said the listing would allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region.The share sale has knocked Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May.The move to go ahead with the Hong Kong listing comes after Alibaba delayed plans to do so earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war.The long-running protests have hurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, and knocked business confidence in the city.The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."
business	Business lobby group CBI says UK not ready for no-deal Brexit	'Hampered'	"The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned the government that neither the UK nor the EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.""While the UK's preparations to date are welcome, the unprecedented nature of Brexit means some aspects cannot be mitigated,"" said the CBI.It has published practical steps it says the UK, EU and firms can take.A government spokesman said the UK has increased the pace of planning for no-deal.The CBI had previously said leaving the EU with a deal was essential to protect the economy and jobs.New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made Michael Gove responsible for planning a no-deal Brexit.Mr Gove has said the UK government is currently ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit.He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels but, writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect.""The CBI's report What Comes Next? The Business Analysis Of No Deal Preparations advises what measures businesses can take to reduce the worst effects.The advice is based on a study of existing plans laid out by the UK government, European Commission, member states and firms.""And although businesses have already spent billions on contingency planning for no deal, they remain hampered by unclear advice, timelines, cost and complexity,"" the CBI says.""Larger companies, particularly those in regulated areas such as financial services, have well-thought-through contingency plans in place, though smaller firms are less well prepared.""The report is based on thousands of interviews with firms of all sizes and sectors, including 50 trade associations, covering all areas of the UK economy.The CBI says that in a no-deal Brexit some 24 of 27 areas of the UK economy would experience disruption.Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Josh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director general, said: ""A deal is absolutely essential if we're to manage the economy in the best way that we can.""But he said preparing for a no-deal scenario did not mark a change in tack for the CBI, which campaigned to remain in the EU and then backed Theresa May's proposed deal.""If you see a storm coming, you put down the sandbags,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean you're going to stop all the flood water, you'll probably still lose the kitchen but you might save the bedroom and that's where we are right now.""He said meetings between businesses and the government needed to ""scale up - and they have to scale up now"". He said that talks about no-deal preparations had been postponed since an initial March deadline to leave the EU was delayed until 31 October.The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but former Prime Minister Theresa May asked for an extension and the date was pushed back to 31 October.A UK government spokesperson said: ""This is a constructive contribution from the CBI, acknowledging the importance of all businesses preparing for no deal on the 31 October.""While we have done more to prepare than this report implies, since the new prime minister was appointed the government has stepped up the pace of planning for no deal. The chancellor has confirmed all necessary funding will be made available for vital no deal preparations. This includes funding for a major nationwide communications campaign to ensure that people and businesses are ready.""Crucially, while there is more to do, the CBI observes that the UK is ahead of the EU in planning for no deal."""
business	Government faces no-deal backlash from its business experts		"The government's attempts to find a technological solution to its Irish border Brexit problem have run into immediate difficulties with its own business advisers.The BBC has obtained internal documents, including the terms of reference which some of its business experts are refusing to sign off on.They are concerned the terms could be used to endorse a plan of action in the event of a no-deal Brexit.They are now asking for alterations.The Business and Trade Union Alternative Arrangements Advisory Group - mostly made up of Northern Ireland business leaders - is one of three committees recently appointed by the government to come up with and test ideas for ""alternative arrangements"" to the so-called backstop.They have been appointed by the Department for Exiting the European Union to advise on the feasibility of new technologies that could maintain the current free flowing Irish border after Brexit occurs.The document says that the ""purpose and objective"" of the group is that ""alternative arrangements should be considered without prejudice to the UK's future customs and regulatory relationship with the EU"".At a meeting, members of the committee asked ministers who were present to alter that objective to ensure their conclusions could not be used to endorse a no-deal Brexit.The document also ruled that the likely response of the Irish government and the European Union to new technological ideas were ""out of scope"".""The focus of discussions should not be on the negotiability of proposals,"" the document says.Some participants at the meeting expressed concerns that there was no concrete commitment in the internal document to abide by the Joint Report - the 2017 agreement by the UK government and EU to avoid a hard border ""including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"".The Joint Report is not mentioned directly in the terms of reference nor in the background context paper prepared for all three advisory groups on alternative arrangements.It is only referred to in an accompanying presentation, also seen by BBC News, that says the need to comply with international obligations and commitments ""includes considering the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the 2017 Joint Report"".A source present at the meeting said that a number of concerns about the government approach to Northern Ireland were articulated at the meeting, including dairy farmers who process over a third of their milk across the border, warning that their herds would have to be culled.A government spokesperson said: 'We do not recognise this account of what have been a very constructive set of meetings with business leaders and technical experts.""As is normal in a first meeting of advisory groups, some general comments were provided on our terms of reference, which we are finalising at present.""However, both Conservative leadership candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, say they plan to use technology to replace the backstop - an insurance policy that dealt with the Irish border by assuming a period of UK alignment with Europe on most customs and regulations issues, even after Brexit.The Irish government and the EU have indicated openness to talk about technological solution, but expressed doubts that they will exist for many years, insisting that the backstop must be part of a negotiated EU exit."
business	Boots' parent firm Walgreens 'gets record buyout offer'		"Boots' parent company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, has reportedly received a buyout offer from private equity group KKR, which, if it goes through, would be the biggest of its kind on record.KKR sold its final shares in Walgreens from a previous buyout three years ago.And it is likely to have to work with other investors to complete a deal.Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of equity group Blackstone, said last week any deal to buy Walgreens would be a ""stretch"" in current market conditions.Speaking at a Reuters conference, he said: ""It might be possible. It's a huge stretch doing things over $50bn.""Walgreens has a reported market value of about $56bn (£43.6bn) and is nearly $17bn in debt. Its shares rose 6% when news of the possible deal broke, after they had fallen by nearly 20% between January and October.The company operates in 25 countries, including in the UK, where it owns Boots.It has been trying to save nearly $2bn a year by closing stores and cutting jobs.As part of that process, Boots announced in June that it will shut 200 shops across the UK.Neither Walgreens nor KKR has commented on the reports."
business	What Boris Johnson said next to business		"Boris Johnson attempted to mend some fences with the business community this morning.His infamous expletive caused widespread shock within industry and highlighted for many how relations had soured between business and the party that used to be its natural champion.He started by telling the 40 or so business leaders that those remarks had been taken out of context. The truth, he said, was that he had always loved business, and attendees I've spoken to were prepared to believe that his comment was indeed an off-the-cuff Borisism.He was his usual charismatic self and he struck a positive note for the commercial future of the UK and the role of business as being seen as a force for good. That all went down very well.However, when pressed on what his plan is - people were less convinced.Mr Johnson's plan appeared to be to defer the negotiations over the problematic Irish backstop till after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. He proposed extending the transition period till December 2021, which would give everyone enough time to negotiate a free-trade deal and come up with the technology to ensure no physical infrastructure would be required at the Irish border.This plan is roughly the same as the one suggested by Kit Malthouse. A plan that was dismissed by the EU as it required the backstop to be replaced by a solution that does not yet exist and therefore couldn't be considered a backstop at all.When asked whether he was prepared to leave with no deal on 31 October, he said that it was not his preferred option, but we had to prepare for no-deal and if necessary go through with it.One attendee I spoke to felt that ""his heart wasn't in that comment"", another said, ""the look in his eyes made you question whether he really meant that"".This is the crucial question for most businesses. It appears that even when he gives a fairly straight answer, some businesses still don't think - perhaps because they don't want to hear - that no-deal is very much on the table as far as Boris Johnson is concerned.He left Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions after he left the breakfast. The attendees who I spoke to found her unconvincing - ""she lost the room"" according to one. As a long-time Johnson lieutenant she may yet win herself a big job."
business	How to make phone batteries that last longer	Solid progressEyes on the prizeWatts aheadElectric flight?	"When Professor Akira Yoshino was developing a new battery technology in his laboratory in the early 1980s, he didn't think it would amount to much.""At the time, we thought it mainly would be used in 8mm video cameras,"" he laughs.He was well off the mark. These days you are never more than a few feet away from a lithium-ion battery, as they power mobile phones and all sorts of other electronics, from toothbrushes to electric scooters.In recognition of that success, Prof Yoshino was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.But despite improvements, even the most advanced lithium-ion batteries can only store a fraction of the power of a similar weight of petrol or jet fuel.And that is curbing ambitions for even smaller and lighter devices - and more ambitious projects like electric powered aviation.Batteries need to make progress, admits Prof Yoshino, but thankfully, ""there's a lot of interesting approaches"".And ""the solid state battery, I think, is a promising one,"" he says.Solid state batteries can store 50% more energy than lithium-ion, says Douglas Campbell, chief executive of Solid Power, a Colorado university spin-off.They are more stable as well. In lithium-ion batteries the gel inside, the electrolyte, can combust.In 2016, Samsung recalled 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 handsets after fires involving their lithium-ion batteries.Solid state batteries replace that gel with less flammable solid polymers or ceramics.But the batteries being developed by Mr Campbell's firm still require lithium in its metallic form and that's a problem because it is a hard metal to work with.Another problem is that lithium metal isn't yet made on an industrial scale, so just getting enough could be difficult, according to Mr Campbell.But despite those worries, solid state batteries have ""had the breakthrough in basic research, and research and development for mass production techniques is progressing,"" says Prof Yoshino.He thinks it could take another 10 years for solid state batteries to compete with lithium-ion in terms of price.The big prize in the market is batteries for electric cars.The number of electric vehicles in the world will balloon to 125 million by 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts.Battery innovation is ""pretty much driven by whatever's happening in the electric vehicle market"", says Rory McCarthy, an analyst at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.More Technology of BusinessMr McCarthy says the challenge for solid state and other new technologies is to compete with lithium-ion plants, which are getting bigger and bigger, making their batteries cheaper.It takes a new battery factory four to five years to get close to full capacity and 10 years to make its money back, he adds.Lithium-ion technology itself is not a dead end. ""We're learning some new principles we haven't thought of before,"" says Prof Yoshino.That includes the movement of lithium-ion inside batteries. ""We thought we understood that,"" he adds.But now scientists are having to revisit their understanding, since it ""is not what we expected"".""Yes, it goes on and on it never ends"", he laughs.Gene Berdichevsky says that it's only lithium-ion batteries that can make a ""meaningful"" impact on batteries in the near future and spur the mass adoption of electric vehicles.His California-based company, Sila Nanotechnologies, is developing lithium-ion batteries that can potentially deliver a 40% improvement in energy density.They are doing that by by replacing the replacing graphite anodes (the part of the battery where the current flows in) with silicon.""We need continued investment and innovation in lithium-ion batteries,"" he says.Better battery density could make big differences in the way we live.Aeroplanes release 500 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year.But with better batteries, aircraft can use cleaner power and that revolution is already underway.This year's Paris air show saw a working all-electric prototype commercial aircraft, made by the Israeli start-up, Eviation.US regional airline Cape Air has placed a double-digit order. Meanwhile Canada's Harbour Air said in March it aims to become the world's first all-electric airline.With 30% of flights under 300 miles, short haul flight should be easy to electrify, says Los Angeles start-up Wright Electric.And much denser batteries could also electrify big lorries that today rely on fossil fuels.Meanwhile, for some better batteries could change their lives.""I have an off-road chair with six wheels,"" says Curt Oswalt, a former US air force translator who uses a battery-powered wheelchair after a 2002 injury.""My batteries first started acting up roughly two years ago,"" he says.One night, unable to sleep, he went for a 01:00 stroll around his neighbourhood in the Texan countryside.""My battery indicator went from reading three-quarters full to dead, in under three seconds,"" he says.Stranded, he had to wait under a street light until 04:30, when a sheriff found him and helped him home.A more recent battery failure has meant he's been unable to leave his house unassisted for nine days.""So yes,"" he says, ""looking forward to better batteries!"""
business	Why Hong Kong's 'dead' extradition bill is still bad for business	People, money exodus?Extradition billBad for businessLooming 2047 threat	"The leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, said this week that a controversial extradition bill was ""dead"".The comments provided much relief for businesses concerned about the fall-out from proposed changes to allow for extraditions to mainland China.They had worried these changes would hurt the very autonomy that has made Hong Kong into one of Asia's most important financial hubs.But protesters remain unconvinced and want to see the extradition bill formally withdrawn.A stand-off between the government and protestors is thus likely to continue, posing a fresh risk to Hong Kong's international reputation as an attractive place to do business.""There's an eerie sense that the government and protesters have a large space between them,"" Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told me.""The local economy is feeling the pinch of the US-China trade war - protests are an extra layer. It's really important that there's some conclusion to this.""Indeed, there are already signs that people are getting nervous in Asia's oldest financial hub.Anecdotal evidence shows that the wealthy in Hong Kong are already considering their options.""I've definitely seen a spike in inquiries from high-net-worth individuals in Hong Kong looking to secure residency rights or citizenship elsewhere in the world,"" David Lesperance, an immigration lawyer, told me.Mr Lesperance says those high-net-worth individuals in Hong Kong had been worried for some time.But the recent controversy surrounding the extradition bill, and the subsequent protests and storming of the legislative council, have really prompted action, he said.""People will be strengthening up their back-up plans with the acquisition of citizenships, either by investment or naturalisation,"" Mr Lesperance says.""I can confirm this is definitely happening.""Private banking clients are also making inquiries about moving accounts to Singapore and some private bankers told me a record number are already doing so.Others, however, say only a small percentage of their clients are worried.Some in the business community say the risk premium of operating in Hong Kong has also already gone up.Some companies are reportedly actively exploring moving their headquarters elsewhere, they say, although there is no official evidence of that yet.Given that the bill is just ""dead"" and has not yet been formally withdrawn, experts expect protests to continue.Marches are already being planned for the coming weeks and protesters say they will not stop until all their demands are met.But lawyers are confident the controversial extradition bill will never see the light of day.""It seems to be about saving face for Carrie Lam and avoiding being seen to give in to protesters' demands. That's why she didn't use the word 'withdraw',"" says Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of the book City of Protest.""There's no secret plan to reintroduce the bill. Not least because the pro-Beijing political parties who technically need to pass it in parliament are extremely annoyed by what's happened. There's no political will to push this through.""Still, the street protests are expected to continue and these are already having an impact on business in the city.""Tourism is down 5-10% so far [since the protests began],"" Allan Zeman, a Hong Kong businessman and founder of Hong Kong's popular nightlife district Lan Kwai Fong, told me.""Retail is down, many of the retail shops where protesters have been had to close down. Business is destabilised.""But the long-term fall-out could be limited.Previous, similarly big protests had no major lasting impact on the economy, said Mr Zeman.""We had Occupy Central for 79 days in Hong Kong and this city recovered and bounced back,"" he told me.""What this is really about is social problems - housing and how to bring prices down. If your life is good, then you will love the government and China. If your rent is high, you will go to the streets.""Hong Kong's economic survival depends on it being independent and autonomous from China - a predicament Mr Zeman says China is well aware of and would not be willing to risk.But many in the business community have told me that its relevance and economic future also hinges on it being the gateway to the mainland - a tricky balance to strike particularly for a population increasingly concerned about freedom.""I have to grow old here, raise my kids here. And China's influence is becoming stronger all the time,"" Naomi Ho, a 25 year old activist, told me. ""2047 is just around the corner. If we do nothing now, Hong Kong might as well be another city in China.""That's the year when Hong Kong's Basic Law ends, and what happens to the territory's special status under the ""one country, two systems"" principle is unclear.Under the Basic Law, which has been in place since the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Hong Kongers are guaranteed a level of autonomy and freedoms that mainland Chinese don't have. An independent judiciary, for instance, and the right to protest are among them.The international community is also taking note.In a report in 2018, the European Commission said Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" principle was the cornerstone of the territory's economic success and that it had ""legitimate concerns about whether Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and its attractiveness as an international business centre will continue to be upheld in the long term"".One of the glaring realities this current political impasse has brought home is just how close 2047 is.For many of the young people protesting out in the streets that I met in Hong Kong though, the threat of China's increasing influence is just too great a risk to ignore.And therein lies Hong Kong's conundrum. It needs to balance China's economic presence with the demands and desires of its youth - who see no economic future in accepting more control from Beijing."
business	The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs	Global Trade	"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief""."
business	Jamie Oliver to expand restaurants abroad after UK collapse		"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is to open more restaurants abroad, six months after he was forced to close most of his UK operations.Jamie Oliver Group has said international franchisees plan to open 21 new Jamie Oliver-branded restaurants by the end of 2020.At least two of those restaurants will be under a new casual dining brand called Jamie Oliver Kitchen.In May, the UK business fell into administration, with 1,000 jobs lost.At the time, the celebrity chef said he was ""devastated [and] saddened"" by what had happened.However, while the UK group - which included the Jamie's Italian chain, Barbecoa and Fifteen - collapsed, the international businesses stayed afloat.It has 70 restaurants, all of which are run as franchises, in 27 markets worldwide.Two new Jamie Oliver Kitchen restaurants are now due to open in Bali and Bangkok by the end of November and will be run by group franchise partner HPL.The restaurants will open in repurposed Jamie's Italian premises.Nineteen further restaurants will open abroad next year under various brands, including Jamie's Italian, Jamie Oliver's Pizzeria, Jamie's Deli and Jamie Oliver's Diner. The firm did not say where they would be based.Following the administration in May, all but three of Jamie Oliver's 25 UK restaurants closed. The firm had been struggling with a UK-wide slowdown in the casual dining sector which also saw Byron and Prezzo announce closures.In September, it emerged that Mr Oliver had paid himself a £5.2m dividend in 2018, but also poured millions of his own money into supporting his restaurants.Profits at the Jamie Oliver Group - which includes the chef's media business as well as his restaurant interests - fell sharply that year.Speaking about the new openings, Mr Oliver said: ""Over the past 20 years, I have travelled around the world to discover exciting flavour combinations, picking up incredible influences along the way.""The new restaurants will bring those inspirations to life and serve some of my absolute all-time favourites."""
business	The growing importance of the night-time economy		"It is 04:00 in central London's clubbing district, Soho. People are slowly streaming out of the clubs, some huddled in doorways waiting for taxis, others dancing on the kerb, merry and very loud.The night-time economy is a growing part of the UK economy. Nationally, it is the UK's fifth-biggest industry, accounting for at least 8% of the UK's employment and annual revenues of £66bn, according to the Night Time Industries Association.In fact, the growth of that business activity at night-time prompted London's mayor to call upon the talents of TV presenter and performer Amy Lamé. She has been London's first ""night czar"" since 2016, and is in charge of the city between 18:00 and 06:00.""My role encompasses looking after the welfare and wellbeing of the 1.6 million people that are usually working in London. My biggest concern is the 190,000 that work for the National Health Service here in London every night,"" she says.""Then there's the 150,000 people who are working in professional services - that can involve anything from cleaning, to working for banks and financial services across the globe.""Third on the list in terms of numbers, are people that traditionally work in the night-time economy. So, bars, pubs and clubs, entertainment. Our economy during the day is growing 2% - while the economy at night is growing 2.2%,"" says Ms Lamé.Her team at the Greater London Assembly has conducted what they say is the most comprehensive research in the world in any capital regarding their night-time industry. They've now identified exactly what they think is the next big thing to plough money in to.""We're ensuring that London's grassroots live music venues are able to not just survive, but thrive. How much does Adele or Ed Sheeran bring to our economy? It's massive. Where did they start? Grassroots live music venues - and that is where the investment is,"" she says.But not everybody agrees with the virtues of 24/7 business.Tony Keith Jones owns two newsagents in the centre of Coventry in the post-industrial Midlands. He says local authorities are wrongly ignoring the biggest night-time concern of a small business like his - higher crime levels.""We have massive, massive stealing problems at night-time,"" he says. ""The criminals like nicking off all the retailers in the city centre, and they get no punishment apart from a slap on the wrist. Unless you've been caught millions of times - police don't do anything about it.""Statistically, some types of crimes do occur more frequently at night. A report by the London Assembly's police and crime committee back in 2016 found that ""alcohol features in a higher proportion of crimes in London that occur at night than during the day"", and that ""areas with the most night-time violence with injury offences, tend to be those with a strong night-time economy"".In the US, New York - the city that never sleeps - has appointed its own night-time mayor. Since 2018 Ariel Palitz has officially been the senior executive director of the Office of Nightlife at NYC.She comes from a night-time entertainment background, and Ms Palitz agrees about the challenges faced by night-time businesses. ""I owned a nightclub in New York myself for 10 years. So I can tell you from personal experience - if it was easy, everyone would do it,"" she says.""The night-time economy in New York generates $35.1bn (£27bn) in economic activity, and nearly $700m in local tax revenue. The NYPD [the police department in New York] has come up with a new philosophy - implementing the mediation approach, rather than summons and enforcement techniques.""Yet as with any economy, there are some questions about how this new economy is being built - and importantly who gets paid and who doesn't.""Night-time venues make a lot of money from unpaid labour, like mine,"" says Jenan Younis, a colorectal surgeon by day, and an unpaid comedienne by night. She performs at some of London's most famous comedy venues.""There must be something dark about my psyche, but I've always been a night-time worker. An entire industry like mine has burgeoned on unpaid labour - and we exist in the shadows.""Venue owners might be getting more and more money pumped in to them by local authority schemes - but is any of it going to give organic growth in the long run? How much of this is going back to the actual generators of this value? None,"" she argues.Yet underlying this is a long-term shift within the night-time economy, the fact some parts of the sector are in decline. Many cultural venues are rapidly disappearing. Across the UK, 44% of nightclubs shut between 2005-2015, and 25% of pubs closed from 2001-2016, says the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI).Alex Green from market research group IBS World gathers statistics from across the world, and says that in the UK nightclubs have been in decline for the past five years: ""This is being caused by changing consumer preferences, patterns of drinking, police response, as well as social pressures, noise complaints and anti-social behaviour.""Anecdotally, that makes sense. Back in Soho in the early morning, my fellow post-clubbers aren't showing themselves in the numbers I used to see a decade ago - perhaps I'm part of a cohort of disappearing hardcore night clubbers."
business	Spain votes as economy wobbles	Regional tensions	"Voters are going to the polls in Spain on Sunday, in an election overshadowed by the crisis in Catalonia and the rise of the right-wing Vox party.But Spain is now also facing an uncertain economic outlook, with slowing growth and unemployment that is the second-highest in the EU, despite having come down from earlier highs.Although Spain did bounce back quite well from the global financial crisis, it took a while to get started. The economy either contracted or just about failed to grow for five consecutive years, starting from 2009.Once the recovery did get under way, however, Spain managed several years of growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%. Not stellar, but perfectly respectable.Unemployment has come down a long way from its peak, which was more than 26% for the adult population and almost 56% among young people.The figures are still high. On both those measures, it is the second-worst in the EU after Greece. Still, the progress is very apparent.Now, however, the outlook is somewhat cloudier. For next year, the International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of less than 2% for the first time since 2014.The political situation in Catalonia is a factor, as tensions continue between local separatists and the central government in Madrid.The region accounts for 19% of the Spanish economy. It is the largest regional economy in the country (though only just ahead of Madrid).After growing more quickly than the national average in 2016 and 2017, Catalonia slipped behind last year and probably will this year too, according to forecasts from economists at the bank BBVA.Spain has also been affected by the global economic slowdown.True, it is not as exposed as Germany, which as a big exporter of machinery and vehicles is especially vulnerable to the disruption of international trade that has followed from the more confrontational approach taken by US President Donald Trump's administration.But tourism has been affected by weaker demand from European visitors, while some Spanish regions, particularly in the north of the country, have seen export performance weaken.That said, Spain does not appear to be in imminent danger of suffering a recession, though the gloomier outlook does raise the spectre of the crisis.Economy Minister Nadia Calviño said in a BBC interview that the pattern of growth now is more sustainable than in the past.The crisis followed a boom in the construction industry and a surge in lending by banks, which were subsequently bailed out with the help of a eurozone loan.Ms Calviño said construction now accounts for a much smaller share of employment than it did then and families and companies have ""deleveraged"": that is, they have lower debts.However, the government's debt has more than doubled since before the crisis and a sharp economic slowdown would almost certainly force it to borrow more."
business	General election 2019: What are the challenges for the UK's economy?	Fewer young people own homesWages are £5,000 less than they might have beenPoverty among people who are workingAn ageing populationProblems with taxGoing for zero	Brexit continues to dominate the headlines - but the UK economy faces many other important challenges.Inequality in the housing market, poverty among working people and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are among them.For any party hoping to win power on 12 December, these are serious issues.Only 36% of those born in the late 1980s have become homeowners by the age of 30, compared with 55% or more of those born between the 1940s and the 1970s.Younger generations have seen the price of homes rise far more quickly than their salaries - the main reason for this change. This is particularly true in southern England.Many more people in their 20s and 30s are now renting privately. Their average housing costs are about 20% higher than 20 years ago.Meanwhile, low interest rates mean most owner-occupiers - many of them older people - enjoy lower housing costs than in the past.Growth in productivity - the amount the UK's workers produce per hour worked - has been unprecedentedly poor since the 2008 financial crisis.In the past 11 years, the amount workers produce every hour has grown by just 2.9%. That's about as much as it grew on average every 15 months in the preceding 40 years.As a result, productivity in the UK is now 19% lower than it would have been had the trend seen before 2008 continued.This really matters.In the long-run, average living standards grow in line with growth in productivity.Average hourly wages are roughly at the same level now as they were in 2008. Given they usually rise every year, this means they are also 19% below where they would have been had long-term trends continued.A full-time worker on average hourly wages now earns £5,000 a year less than they would have done had the pre-2008 trend continued.Low wages have had another knock-on effect - most people living in poverty in the UK are actually in working households.In 2017-18, 58% of all those below the poverty line (less than £248 a week income for a couple with no children) were either in paid work or living in a household with someone who worked. This figure compares with 41% two decades ago.In part, this reflects positive trends. There are fewer households where nobody works, and pensioner incomes have increased.But it also reflects the fact for low-income workers, wages are not growing as fast as housing costs.As the UK's ageing population grows, so does the amount of money the UK spends on pensions and healthcare.In the past 30 years, spending on these areas has increased from 8.5% of national income to 13.1% - in other words, a rise of £100bn.It's estimated this figure will have to increase by 1.7% of national income (£37bn in today's terms) over the next 10 years. This is just to keep pace with changes in the population and other cost pressures.That will mean big tax rises, or spending cuts, just to keep things broadly as they are.The UK government currently takes nearly 35p in tax from every £1 earned - the highest share it's taken since the 1940s.Given the ageing population, and the various spending promises being made by the main parties, this is unlikely to go down any time soon.Having said that, many European countries raise more in taxes. But they tend to raise more from people on average incomes.The UK, on the other hand, tends to rely on a small number of high earners for a lot of the tax it raises. The highest-income 1% of adults pay more than a third of all income tax.The problem with this is that public finances are more vulnerable to changes in the income or behaviour of high earners. If a relatively small number leave the UK, this can have a outsized effect on taxes.The amount of money raised is also under threat because tax levels on petrol and diesel have not been maintained. And it can be difficult to raise tax from multinational companies.More like thisThe main parties all say they want to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest.While progress has been good so far (the UK's domestic emissions are 44% down on their 1990 level), the UK is still nowhere near meeting the target.According to the Committee on Climate Change, radical changes are needed in the next few years. By 2025, it says, the UK should have a plan to completely replace gas as a source of domestic heating. By the early 2030s, all new cars and vans sold should be electric.One of the economic challenges here is the less well-off spend more of their income on heating and transport costs. Any taxes targeting the carbon people produce need careful consideration to avoid making some worse off.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.Paul Johnson is director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.More details about the work of the IFS can be found here.
business	Should Germany spend more to revive its economy?	Global TradeTax cuts for business?	"The eurozone has a problem. Its biggest economy, Germany, is in or close to recession.That has further stimulated a debate about whether Berlin should open the financial taps and spend more.Should Germany launch a programme of spending on, for example, its infrastructure?Should the government ditch the policy of balancing the budget, known as ""the black zero"" and the related legal restriction on borrowing called the ""debt brake""?We had some clues about the impact of Germany's downturn with eurozone economic growth figures that showed growth of 0.2% in the third quarter of the year. That is sluggish though slightly better than many economists were expecting. We will have to wait two weeks for a read-out on Germany's own performance in the same period.The eurozone as a whole might not be in recession, but inevitably the downturn in Germany affects the country's neighbours.The question is what should policymakers - especially the German government and the European Central Bank (ECB) - do about the situation.The ECB has already taken steps. It has cut its interest rates to ultra-low levels (to below zero for one of its key rates) and it is about to re-start the policy known as quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly-created moneyBut there are real doubts about how effective these measures will be. Many economists believe that monetary policy - what central banks do - has done about as much as it can in the eurozone.Many argue that governments should do more. The current president of the ECB Mario Draghi and his successor Christine Lagarde, who takes over this week, have both taken that view.In September, Ms Lagarde told the European Parliament: ""Some countries in the euro area can use some of their fiscal space [government spending and taxation] in order to improve broadband infrastructure and set in place the public spending that will help fight the recession.""She didn't name the countries that could afford to take such action, but she did say it was now true of a majority of them. The most obvious example is Germany which has had a surplus in its public finances - with tax revenue higher than spending - since 2012.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:The IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, was explicit on this point in the foreword to the IMF's recent World Economic Outlook.""A country like Germany should take advantage of negative borrowing rates to invest in social and infrastructure capital,"" she wrote.Her reference to negative borrowing rates refers to the fact that Germany, and a number of other countries, can borrow at an interest rate of less than zero. In effect, the financial markets pay them to borrow.Prof Peter Bofinger of Würzburg University, and a former member of Germany's economics experts council, agrees with Ms Gopinath that the country should take advantage of the these below-zero borrowing costs to invest in infrastructure and social housing.Currently he says net infrastructure investment - that is, after the wear and tear on existing infrastructure is factored in - is below zero.The idea that Germany has a problem in this area might come as a bit of a surprise. But Prof Bofinger says he often sees the evidence himself. He describes travelling by train in the country as ""a real adventure - whether the train will arrive, how many minutes and hours they are delayed, whether you get something to eat on the train"".""Transportation is in extremely bad shape and it is a consequence of insufficient investment for many years.""He says it is a ""tremendous mistake"" not to use the opportunity presented by those favourable borrowing costs to address some of these problems.He believes the debt brake and black zero policies don't make sense. If every major government followed the black zero policy, ""the world economy would end up in a black hole,"" he says.Currently among the G20 group of leading economies only two others - Russia and South Korea - have government budgets with a surplus.But Prof Bofinger does not favour using the infrastructure programme in the short term as a stimulus for a flagging economy. The construction industry is already working at full capacity.What he favours is more generous tax treatment to encourage business investment, which he says is currently where German economic performance is weak.But there are many defenders of Germany's cautious approach to managing its government finances.Prof Clemens Fuest is the director of one of the country's leading economic research agencies, the IFO institute in Munich. He argues that Germany is not facing a serious downturn - though there might be a technical recession in the sense of two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity.Germany has full employment and does not currently need further stimulus, he argues. There would, however, be a case for allowing the government to increase its borrowing if there were a sharper decline in economic activity.He agrees that the country could benefit from infrastructure improvements but it is nonetheless in better shape than in many other European countries. The problem is not so much lack of money for projects, he says, but delays in implementing them often due to the objections raised by German residents.He argues the debt brake was an appropriate response in 2009, around the time of the global financial crisis, when the government's debt was higher in relation to GDP and it remains a useful restraint."
business	Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy	'Attempt to avoid scrutiny'	"The governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC that the new Brexit deal struck by the government is ""welcome"" and a ""net economic positive"".Mark Carney said the deal ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"".However the governor warned that the deal might not boost the economy to the same extent as the deal put forward by Boris Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.Mr Johnson's deal is due to be voted on by MPs on Saturday.Mr Carney said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated this week meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the economy as the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.When pressed about the impact of extra customs checks likely from the more distant relationship with the EU envisaged by the new deal, Mr Carney said its economic outcome would not ""overlap"" the closest version of the previous Theresa May deal, ""and that last bit is diplomacy"".""The new economic partnership remains to be negotiated so there's still a wide range of potential relationships that can be struck on the basis of this deal, but short term, it takes away these risks,"" said Mr Carney.""Last night in the G20 room it was universally welcomed that this progress had been made because, if I put this into context - the world's global economic outlook - the world is in a precarious position - I'm quoting the IMF - and directionally we'd agree with that characterisation.Chancellor Sajid Javid has been less diplomatic, refusing to recalculate Treasury impact assessments, despite requests from some MPs who want an economic forecast in time for the crucial Commons vote on the deal.His decision not to release a new analysis has drawn criticism from those who think MPs should have an updated version of the impact the deal.Catherine McKinnell MP, interim chair of the Treasury Committee, has written to the chancellor asking him to publish an updated economic analysis ahead of the vote on Saturday.""The Treasury Committee asked HM Treasury whether the government has updated its economic analysis of Brexit three months ago, yet we are still awaiting a response,"" she wrote.""It appears to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny. If the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands.""Previous Treasury forecasts showed a smaller economy from a basic free trade agreement."
business	China economy: Third quarter growth misses expectations	What challenges does China face?	"China's economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the third quarter as it struggled with a US-led trade war and softer domestic demand.In the three months to September, the economy expanded 6% from a year earlier, official figures showed.The result fell just short of expectations for 6.1% growth for the period.The slowdown comes despite government efforts to support the economy, including measures such as tax cuts.The latest figures mark a further loss of momentum in the world's second largest economy, which had already seen growth languishing at its slowest pace in around three decades.The rate remained within the government's target range for annual growth of between 6% and 6.5%.The strength of the Chinese economy is closely watched as slowing growth can have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.The country has become a key engine of growth in recent decades. Its healthy demand for a range of products, from commodities to machinery, has supported growth around the world.Some analysts worry that a sharp slowdown in China could hurt an already sluggish world economy and increase the risk of a recession.Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said pressure on the Chinese economy ""should intensify in the coming months"".He said more intervention by policymakers to support the economy was likely ""but it will take time for this to put a floor beneath economic growth"".China has been fighting a trade war with the US for the past year, which has created uncertainty for businesses and consumers.At the same time, it faces domestic challenges including a swine fever outbreak that has fuelled inflation and hit consumer spending.This week the International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2019 growth forecast for China to 6.1% from 6.2% due to the long-running trade dispute and slowing domestic demand.But there have been some signs of progress toward resolving the trade battle, with the US and China reaching a ""phase one deal"" earlier this month.The government has sought to help the economy through tax cuts and by taking measures to boost liquidity in the financial system.Still, some analysts say the government has become more cautious in providing stimulus amid growing concerns about China's rising debt pile.Any analysis of China's economic data has to come with a caveat: Many economists believe the actual figures are much lower than what we are told, but it's the trajectory of growth and signalling from the government that you should pay attention to.The fact that the growth figures have come in below market expectations indicate that China's economy is hurting more than many thought.There were signs from China that these numbers were going to be worrying. Earlier this week, Premier Li Keqiang made the unusual move to warn local officials that they must do ""everything"" to make sure they hit growth targets for this year.China's economy is being hit on three fronts: The US-led trade war, slowing demand at home and rising domestic challenges including the outbreak of swine fever that has dealt a huge blow to its pork farmers. It's also pushed up prices for consumers.China's slowdown is nothing new. But these challenges pose new headaches for policymakers who are trying to manage the slowdown. The country's political stability depends on economic security - and over the last forty years, that's what the Communist Party has delivered. They're under pressure to keep that contract."
business	UK economy facing 'heightened risk of recession'	'Too downbeat'	"The UK's economy may have tipped into recession following a downturn in the dominant service sector, according to closely-watched figures.The IHS Markit/CPS purchasing managers' index for services fell to a six-month low of 49.5 in September. The 50 level divides growth from expansion.It suggests the economy shrank 0.1% in the three months to September, after a 0.2% fall in the previous quarter.Some experts urged caution, as official data last month eased recession fears.Combined with even weaker manufacturing and construction purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) earlier this week, September's all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7. This was its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009.""Coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, [this] would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,"" said IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson. A recession is normally defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters.""September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,"" Mr Williamson added. He highlighted Brexit uncertainty, worries about trade tensions between the US, China and Europe, and weaker growth in the eurozone.Separate PMI figures on Thursday showed Germany's services sector sharply lost momentum in September, fuelling fears that contraction in the country's manufacturing sector was spilling over into the rest of Europe's largest economy. Germany's services PMI fell to 51.4 from 54.8 in August, the lowest reading for three years.Although the PMI data is closely followed it is not considered foolproof. Immediately after the Brexit referendum, the data indicated a sharper downturn than was actually the case.Last month, latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) pointed to the UK economy growing faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession.Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. ONS growth data for August is due for publication on 10 October.This survey has sounded the recession alarm bells - pointing to a second quarter of shrinking GDP. Not only does it imply one of the biggest slumps in activity in the dominant service sector since the financial crisis but, taken with its counterparts for manufacturing and construction, signals output falling across the economy.Should we be worried? These surveys are the first monthly insight into the health of major parts of our economy. But in these tumultuous times, they may be more of a mood check rather than a whole-body MOT.The authors refer to Brexit-related anxiety: sentiment, rather than activity, may be clouding or obscuring the picture. It wouldn't be the first time. Earlier this year (because of course we've been here before) these surveys failed to fully reflect the flurry in Brexit preparations. Nor do they cover retail or the public sector - two areas that have underpinned the growth we have seen. The surveys can and do deviate from official growth numbers.But it'd be dangerous to ignore the warnings. Sentiment can dictate all sorts of business plans - from investment to hiring. The impact of those can last longer than one quarter's GDP.Economists said Thursday's PMI figures were a warning. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said they reignited concerns the economy is in recession as it ""suggests that growth in the biggest part of the economy has fizzled out"".However, while Dean Turner, UK economist for UBS Global Wealth Management, said the figures were ""gloomy"", he added that the PMIs ""have had a tendency to overreact relative to reality. It is too early to conclude that the UK is heading for a recession on these numbers alone.""And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, went further. ""The survey's poor track record recently means its recession signal should not be believed,"" he said. ""Markit's services survey has been far too downbeat over the last year."""
business	Uber launches job app for gig economy workers	'Vetted and qualified' workers	"Uber is testing new ground with an app to put casual workers in touch with employers, as it faces an increasingly tough climate for its core ride-hailing business.Uber Works will allow cleaners, bar staff and warehouse workers to compare pay rates and sign up for shifts.The app, which launches on Friday, will initially only be available in Chicago.It will compete with a range of rival apps in the US market including Wonolo, Workpop and Shiftgig.The move comes as several parts of the world tighten regulation around Uber's operations as a ride-hailing firm. California recently passed legislation designed to pave the way for so-called “gig workers” to become employees and gain additional rights, which is expected to increase costs for firms such as Uber.Millions of American workers use staffing agencies, Uber said in a blog post announcing the venture. But it believes the process can be made more transparent and faster for both employees and firms.The app will provide information on pay, location and working conditions. Workers can also use it to track working hours and breaks, the firm said.Employers would be able to tap into a ready pool of ""vetted and qualified"" temporary labour, Uber said.Uber will focus on making the app successful in Chicago, where it has already operated in a test phase for the past year, before introducing it elsewhere, it added.The growth of casual hiring, dubbed the ""gig economy"", has been controversial. Some staff hired on an ad hoc basis say they appreciate the flexibility it offers, while others suffer income insecurity and a lack of other welfare benefits of employee status.Drivers working for Uber's original ride-hailing business have taken the company to court to establish the firm's duty to provide staff benefits such as holiday pay and sickness cover.Uber Works has agreed partnerships with staffing agencies in Chicago that employ, pay and handle worker benefits, potentially side-stepping this issue with the new platform."
business	California passes landmark gig economy rights bill		"California lawmakers have passed a bill that paves the way for gig economy workers to get holiday and sick pay.Assembly Bill 5, as its known, will affect firms like Uber and Lyft, which are based in California and depend on those working in the gig economy.Some estimates suggest costs for those firms would increase by 30% if they have to treat workers as employees.But opponents of the bill say it will hurt those people who want to work flexible hours.The rise of the gig economy, where people accept work on a per job basis, has spawned a swathe of mobile apps, normally putting people in touch directly with drivers or riders.But fears that tech firms like Uber or DoorDash, a food delivery company, are exploiting their scale to erode workers' rights have caused lawmakers to look at how to protect those workers.In California, Assembly Bill 5 would put into law a judgement from the state's supreme court last year that created a new test for whether a worker should be considered an employee.Employee status can entitle them to benefits like health care, minimum wage and paid time off. That would change the nature of the gig-economy, which has been a cornerstone of the model adopted by a raft of valuable new companies.But California state senator Maria Elena Durazo said underpaying workers wasn't innovative.It's not just tech firms in California that are worried about the proposed change in law.Contracting work has taken hold in many industries and California has often led the way in introducing legislation that is adopted elsewhere in the US.""People ought to be very concerned because what happens here does tend to get copied in other states,"" Joseph Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association, which represents truck drivers, many of whom are temporary and freelance workers, told Reuters.It's still not clear how the bill will be implemented.US Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have all come out in support of the bill, which is backed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose signature is required to turn it into law.But on Tuesday, Mr Newsom told the Wall Street Journal that he planned to continue negotiating with companies hoping to be exempted from the bill.Uber and Lyft have both proposed a referendum on the decision and put $90m aside to lobby for that.In a statement after the bill was passed, Lyft said: ""We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need.""In the UK, Uber lost its bid to convince the Court of Appeal that its workers weren't staff. It asked the court to overturn an employment tribunal decision that Uber drivers be treated as workers rather than self-employed.The tribunal ruled that two drivers were staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.The business models of gig economy companies are already under strain - Uber lost more than $5bn in the last quarter alone.Some estimates suggest that having to treat workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, could increase costs by as much as 30%.Uber and rival ridesharing service Lyft joined forces to push back again the bill.They suggested a guaranteed minimum wage of $21 per hour instead of the sweeping changes the bill would bring.But that pledge wasn't enough to sway California's Senate, and the state's governor Gavin Newsom is expected to soon sign the bill into law.That paves the way for California's 1 million gig workers to gain added rights next year."
business	India delivers surprise corporate tax cuts to boost economy		"India has cut its corporate tax rates in an effort to spur investment and boost growth in the country's faltering economy.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the base corporate tax rate would be lowered to 22% from 30%.The surprise move triggered a stock market rally, with the Sensex index jumping 4.5%.The tax cuts are the latest measures to boost spending and shore up investment in India.Under the slate of reforms announced on Friday, India will lower its corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% for companies that don't seek exemptions.Firms that do receive incentives or exemptions will see their tax rate cut to 25% from 35%.In addition, some new manufacturing firms will see their corporate tax rate lowered to 15% from 25%.A Prasanna, head of research at ICICI in Mumbai, said the move would boost investment and employment.""This is a long overdue and hugely positive move by the finance minister. The new rates simplify the tax architecture and it will give a fillip to investments and jobs,"" he told Reuters.India's economic growth is sitting at a six-year low and the government has taken a series of steps to boost the economy.So far this year, India's central bank has cut rates four times and the benchmark rate currently sits at a near-decade low.The country has relied on domestic consumption to fuel growth but spending has slowed sharply."
business	Argentina imposes currency controls to support economy	What has the government said?What triggered the current crisis?How is the move likely to be received?How does this compare with previous crisis measures?How bad can Argentina's crisis get?How will this affect Argentina's forthcoming election?	"Argentina has imposed currency controls in an attempt to stabilise markets as the country faces a deepening financial crisis.The government will restrict foreign currency purchases following a sharp drop in the value of the peso.Firms will have to seek central bank permission to sell pesos to buy foreign currency and to make transfers abroad.Argentina is also seeking to defer debt payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with the crisis.In an official bulletin issued on Sunday, the government said that it was necessary to adopt ""a series of extraordinary measures to ensure the normal functioning of the economy, to sustain the level of activity and employment and protect the consumers"".The central bank said the measures were intended to ""maintain currency stability"".It also said that while individuals can continue to buy US dollars, they will need to seek permission to purchase more than $10,000 (£8,223.50) a month.The measures will apply until the end of this year.Argentina has been struggling with a financial crisis, which was exacerbated by the president's defeat in a recent primary poll.The peso fell to a record low last month after the vote showed that the business-friendly government of President Mauricio Macri is likely to be ousted in elections in October.Mr Macri was elected in 2015 on promises to boost Argentina's economy with a raft of liberal economic reforms.But the country is in a deep recession. It has one of the world's highest inflation rates, running at 22% during the first half of the year.Argentina's economy contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2019, after shrinking 2.5% last year. Three million people have fallen into poverty over the past year.Ordinary Argentines have traditionally had little faith in their own currency, preferring to convert their spare pesos into dollars as soon as they can.They don't trust financial institutions much either, so they resort to what is locally known as the ""colchón bank"" - that is, stuffing their dollars under the mattress.Anecdotal stories abound of people keeping money buried in the garden, hidden in the walls or even stuffed in heating systems - occasionally with disastrous consequences if there is an unexpected cold snap.When you consider Argentina's history of rampant inflation and currency volatility, they arguably have a point.But it does mean that any restrictions on people's ability to buy dollars have an enormous psychological impact.The $10,000 ceiling for dollar transactions is certainly generous in comparison with past actions.People still have bad memories of the ""corralito"", imposed in 2001, which stopped all withdrawals of dollars from bank accounts for a whole year.The only serious attempt to wean Argentines off their dollar dependency dates back to the 1990s under President Carlos Menem, when the peso's value was fixed by law at parity with the dollar.But that put the financial system under severe strain, leading to the economic meltdown of 2001-02.The country is struggling to stave off its fifth debt default in 30 years.Last week, it said it would seek to restructure its debt with the IMF by extending its maturity. This would give the country more time to pay back the money it owes to the IMF.Rating agencies, including Standard & Poor's and Fitch, decided that amounted to a default and downgraded the country's credit ratings.Whatever happens in Argentina, the risk of financial contagion is low, say analysts.Even in the rest of Latin America, markets are unlikely to suffer. The US-China trade war and the slowdown in global growth are much more of a threat.The move will probably help to slow down the depletion of Argentina's foreign currency reserves in the run-up to the presidential election in October.But it is a policy reversal for Mr Macri, who lifted capital controls in December 2015.This sets ""a worrying precedent"", according to Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics.Left-wing candidate Alberto Fernandez, the likely victor of next month's vote, has advisers who are sympathetic to capital controls, he said.""The fact that these have now been introduced by President Macri could make it easier for Mr Fernandez to justify using them in the longer term,"" he added."
business	Will the US's Hong Kong rights law derail trade talks?	What's at stake?How significant is the passing of the US law?Where are we now with trade talks?	"A US law supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong may unsettle trade talks with China, but is unlikely to derail them, analysts say.The US president has signed into law a bill that requires an annual review of Hong Kong's special status with the US.Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and the police.The law comes as the world's two largest economies are trying to end their trade war.US President Donald Trump said he signed the law, known as the Human Rights and Democracy Act, ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"".China responded strongly, with its foreign ministry threatening ""counter-measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"".Michael Hirson at Eurasia Group said that Mr Trump's signing of the bill ""will not derail trade negotiations"".""To be sure, Beijing is angered at the US for interfering in what China considers its domestic affairs and for emboldening the protest movement,"" he said.""But some of China's anger over the bill is posturing for the domestic audience, and Beijing will not be so upset as to let this stand in the way of a truce over trade.""Analysts say the US and China both want to keep the negotiations from stalling, given that stakes are high.They have been fighting a trade for more than a year, placing tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods.China faces another round of US duties on 15 December, and if talks break down, these are likely to go ahead.That would place an additional burden on an economy which is already growing at its slowest pace in decades.The US also wants to avoid higher costs and economic hardship for American consumers, particularly ahead of US elections next year.The December tariffs are concentrated on consumer goods and would therefore have ""a bigger impact on inflation and households than previous rounds of tariffs did"", said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.""The Trump administration appears reluctant to go ahead with the December tariffs because we're reaching the stage where tariffs are starting having a negative impact on the US economy,"" he added.""There are still incentives on both sides to push for a deal, provided they can agree on the terms.""The Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates an annual review to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to continue to justify its special status with the US.Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading position means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.The bill also allows for sanctions to be imposed ""on those responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong"".But analysts said the bill would have no immediate consequences.""The US law calls on the administration to review Hong Kong's special status and to sanction Chinese officials for repression in Hong Kong, but [Mr] Trump is very unlikely to take action in either area,"" said Hirson.US-China trade talks over the past year have been volatile. Sticking points have included how to enforce any deal that is agreed.More recently, both sides seem to be nearing an initial so-called ""phase one"" deal, which will reportedly cover matters such as agricultural purchases, but avoid more sensitive structural issues.A looming 15 December deadline has made the need for an agreement more urgent, but for some analysts, the passing of the Hong Kong rights law in the US has thrown a spanner in the works.""All of the economic logic in favour of reaching a deal and forestalling further tariff increases remains in place,"" said Stephen Olson, research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.""The open question is whether [China's] displeasure will be sufficient to scuttle the Phase One trade deal, which by most accounts appeared to be close to conclusion. At a minimum, it will complicate - and likely delay - resolution."""
business	How fire shaped humans, and forged the modern economy	More Things That Made the Modern Economy:	"""The canyons seemed to act as chimneys, through which the wind and fires swept with the roar of 1,000 freight trains. The smoke and heat became so intense that it was difficult to breathe. The whole world seemed to us men back in those mountains to be aflame. Many thought that it really was the end of the world.""US forest ranger Ed Pulaski was caught right in the middle of what would become known as the ""Big Blowup"" - also known as The Great Fire of 1910. Pulaski realised that his task was no longer to save the forests of northern Idaho, but to protect the firefighters.""Trees were falling all about us,"" he said. ""And it was almost impossible to see through the smoky darkness. Had it not been for my familiarity with the mountain trails, we would never have come out alive, for we were completely surrounded by raging, whipping fire.""My one hope was to reach an old mine tunnel which I knew to be not far from us. We reached the mine just in time.""Pulaski passed out. Earlier, with the fire approaching, he had told his wife Emma where to take shelter with their 10-year-old daughter Elsie - and warned her he might not return. The next morning, he could not see, and his hands were burned. But he was alive, and so were all but five of his men.The Big Blowup had killed 86 people, and consumed enough wood to build 800,000 houses.It also seared the national consciousness and the US Forest Service promised to douse all wildfires as quickly as it could.In fact that promise would turn out to be unwise, but you can understand the need to make it. Fire is terrifying, but it is also fundamental to the modern economy.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.For the first 90% of Earth's history, there was no fire at all. There were volcanic eruptions - but molten rock is not on fire, because fire is a chemical reaction: the process of combustion.It is life that creates both the oxygen and the fuel that fires need to burn. Fossil evidence suggests that flammable plant life evolved around 400 million years ago, and periodically went up in smoke, partly because of those volcanoes, but mostly due to lightning.In recent years, satellite observations have shown us how surprisingly common lightning is - there are around eight million strikes a day. It is still responsible for more wildfires than ill-advised barbecues or carelessly discarded cigarette butts.Fire shaped landscapes - and, with it, evolution. It enabled the spread of grasslands, somewhere around 30 million years ago. Without fire, they would have reverted to scrub or forest. And grasslands are thought to have played a role in the emergence of the hominids who evolved into us.Try to imagine the economy before our ancestors tamed fire.You can start by discarding any products made with metal, or using metal tools - metal starts life in a furnace. The same goes for glass.Now forget anything that involves burning fossil fuels, for transport or electricity; or that uses materials made in the heat of a fire - think plastics - or plants grown with artificial fertilisers, made with the Haber-Bosch process.No bricks or pottery: they are fired in a kiln. There is not much left. Raw, organic food, cut up with a sharp stone? We can hardly call it an ""economy"" at all.Exactly when and how our ancestors learned to control fire is a matter of some debate.Chimps appear to understand how wildfire will spread pretty well. And other species are reportedly alert to the hunting opportunities it offers. Some birds of prey have even been seen picking up burning sticks, dropping them to start a new fire, and pouncing on the creatures who then make a run for it.It seems likely that our ancestors similarly harnessed wildfires for hundreds of thousands of years before they figured out how to make sparks from flint. Perhaps they kept the fires alive by adding slow-burning animal dung.Primatologist Richard Wrangham argues that as cooked food provides more energy, it enabled humans to evolve bigger brains.Meanwhile, archaeologist John Gowlett links fire to the ""social brain"" hypothesis - the idea that we evolved bigger brains to navigate growing social pressures. Evenings around the fire will have given our ancestors more time to socialise.However much truth is in those speculations, economic development has seen us confine fire to various special chambers - from industrial plants to internal combustion engines to the gas oven in your kitchen. The historian Stephen Pyne calls this the ""pyric transition"".And where that has not yet happened, it is a problem: in developing countries, millions of deaths are linked to air pollution caused by cooking on indoor fires. But Pyne argues that this transition increased our fear of wildfires. And with climate change we can expect to see more of those fires.While satellite observations are helping us to understand them, changing patterns of weather and vegetation are making them harder to predict.It took half a century after Pulaski's heroics for consensus to form that quickly extinguishing wildfires is not such a great idea.The problem is that eventually there will be a fire you cannot control - and that fire will be more devastating, because it will burn through all the deadwood that would have been cleared by the small fires if you had not rushed to put them out.And in the meantime, complacency sets in: we are increasingly building in or close to wilderness areas where fires will break out sooner or later. When experts advise it might be wise to let those fires burn, you can bet that the people who live nearby are not going to be too keen.As Andrew Scott argues in his book Burning Planet: ""Our increasing scientific understanding of fire in recent years has not translated into greater public awareness.""Some economists think that there is a parallel between handling wildfires and dealing with some entirely man-made crises. The theory is that getting better at handling small problems creates a growing sense of safety, which paradoxically creates the risk of much larger problems.Take the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the biggest economic ""wildfire"" of our times.In his book Foolproof, the Wall Street Journal's chief financial commentator Greg Ip argues that financial policy-makers had got so good at extinguishing minor crises that people became over-confident, and took silly risks - such as betting the ranch on sub-prime mortgages.It was precisely the success at mitigating previous risk which led to the subsequent misfortune.""Our efforts to make life safer come into conflict with an equally irrepressible desire to make things bigger and more complicated,"" he writes. ""As our cities, transport systems, and financial markets become more interconnected and complex, so have the opportunities for disaster.""Successfully preventing one type of risk may simply funnel it elsewhere, to re-emerge, like a mutated bacteria, in more virulent fashion.""And when a financial crisis came along that could not be stamped out, those bad bets fuelled a global conflagration which itself spread like wildfire.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	German economy slips back into negative growth	Trade war woesAnalysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent	"Germany's economy shrank during the April-to-June period of this year.A decline in exports dampened growth, according to official data, which comes amid concerns of a global slowdown.Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter, according to the Federal Statistics Office.That takes the annual growth rate down to 0.4%. Germany, Europe's largest economy, narrowly avoided a recession last year.Early signs for the third quarter ""look ominous"", said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. ""Manufacturing business surveys for July were all gloomy.""And while the services sector should continue to hold up better, there are some signs that the slump is spreading to the labour market.""While the overall figures were negative, household and government expenditure increased, as did investment outside the construction sector.Construction itself fell after an unusually good first three months, boosted by a mild winter.But Chancellor Angela Merkel's government still believes the economy will grow slightly this year and does not think further stimulus is necessary.""As the chancellor has already laid out, the government does not currently see any need for further measures to stabilise the economy - the fiscal policy of the German government is already expansive,"" a government spokeswoman said.Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Germany was not in a recession and could avoid one by taking the right measures.This is the downside of being an exporting powerhouse. When the international economic environment clouds over, you get rained on.The German statistical office hasn't given a detailed breakdown, but they have confirmed that exports declined and did so by more than imports.China is at the centre of the trade storms and it's also an important export market for Germany. So trade held the economy back, in contrast with consumer spending and investment in Germany which both rose.The economy contracted back in the third quarter of last year, and the subsequent rebound was not all that powerful.Looking ahead, one question is whether Germany will see another decline in the current quarter, which would make it a recession as the term is often defined.Some recent surveys of business confidence have been decidedly downbeat so the ""R"" word is certainly a possibility.That said, Germany could still avoid it, and even if not, the country would at least be going into recession with unemployment that is among the lowest in the world.""The development of foreign trade slowed down economic growth because exports recorded a stronger quarter-on-quarter decrease than imports,"" the statistics office said.The US-China trade war and the UK's departure from the EU, especially if it happens without a deal, are among factors affecting global economic confidence.Last month, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for this year and next, citing US-China tariffs, US car tariffs and no-deal Brexit.China's own economic slowdown has weakened demand for foreign goods. It is an important market for Germany, since it buys plenty of luxury cars.Only the much larger economies of the US and China export more goods than Germany.The results may make authorities consider more monetary stimulus, said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has hinted it could cut interest rates to tackle a slowdown in the eurozone economy.The ECB said last month that a weak manufacturing sector and uncertainty over Brexit and trade threatened to derail growth. It forecast rates at current or lower levels until mid-2020."
business	The big election trade-off - what have we learned?	NHS Plot?Chicken and food standardsDigital taxEconomic impact	"The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons.They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected.Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos.The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month.The papers don't show a secret plot to sell the NHS or a ""plot against the country"".But they do show that pharmaceutical pricing has been on the table, and has been discussed between UK and US officials and UK and the US pharmaceutical industry.That is not a surprise, it was clear from the official US Trade objectives published in February that sought ""procedural fairness"" and ""full market access"" for US pharmaceutical companies.So they have been discussed in scoping discussions by officials. But the prime minister and the Conservative manifesto promises voters that the ""price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table"" - presumably in the future. The PM is promising to resist and reject the US strategic objective to increase the price paid to its drugs companies.There are clear references to US negotiators asking the UK to diverge from existing EU standards for ""Pathogen Reduction Treatments"", which include the chlorination of chicken in order to remove bacteria.The US team offered to share its marketing material on the benefits of chlorinated chicken, to help persuade the public. Also the US raises EU restrictions on anti-microbial usage as ""a significant concern"".It was the Conservative government that pushed hard for such restrictions in the first place amid fears that their overuse is rendering them increasingly ineffective.One meeting was described as ""challenging and difficult"" because Theresa May's Chequers deal would have prevented changes on this. The now PM Boris Johnson resigned from Cabinet because of Chequers, and such changes are now possible under his deal.The Conservative manifesto says we ""will not compromise our high food standards"".Big US tech firms are unhappy with the idea of the government's tax on digital services, and it has been described as a deal breaker for a US-UK trade deal. The issue wasn't raised by US officials according to the documents, but it is mentioned by UK officials who anticipate that it will feature as a ""senior/political"" issue.The Conservatives have a manifesto commitment to implement the tax.The big picture here is that US officials repeatedly question Theresa May's decision to keep the UK economy close to the EU's. The former PM did this because of concerns of the manufacturing industry.US negotiators said repeatedly that such a close relationship would harm prospects of a US deal, even apparently welcoming the possibility of No Deal as ""all to play for"". This broad position has been backed by the current PM, who is offering the electorate a more distant relationship with Europe in order to pursue a US trade deal.That is good for some sectors and regions, and bad for others, such as for example car manufacturers dependent on the free flow of parts around the EU. The papers show that there was an attempt to quantify the benefits of a US trade deal, stating: ""the macroeconomic results were small"".But a US-UK deal alongside a more distant ""hard Brexit"" with tariffs between the UK and the EU was both less good for the UK, and better for the USA. In particular, a ""hard Brexit scenario"" saw a ""larger expansion in US exports in dairy and meat"" to the UK.The real message in these documents is not about an NHS plot, it is about shining some light on one of the most important sets of decisions due to occur in the next Parliament. A decision with big implications and trade-offs for jobs and growth up and down the country."
business	Trump considers new tax cut to boost US economy	Interest rates	"President Donald Trump has confirmed he is considering a new, temporary payroll tax cut to help boost the US economy.White House officials had earlier dismissed reports that the administration was discussing the move.But speaking to reporters, the president said a ""payroll tax is something that we think about, and a lot of people would like to see that"".US workers pay payroll taxes on their earnings to finance health insurance, social security, and pensions.Mr Trump has been talking up the US economy in recent days amid growing unease about a potential recession. ""We're very far from a recession,"" he told the reporters.A strong economy is seen as key to his re-election prospects in 2020, but continuing trade tensions with China have sparked concerns about an imminent slowdown.Tax cuts when the president took office helped boost the economy and sparked a surge in share prices on Wall Street. But many economists think the impact of those cuts is starting to wane.The president said: ""We're looking at various other tax reductions - but I'm looking at that all the time anyway. Tax reductions - that's one of the reasons why we're in such a strong economic position.""He also suggested his administration was looking at possible cuts in capital gains tax, but emphasised that nothing has been decided. Such a move would be likely to face challenges from Democrats in Congress.The president again pressed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. ""We're looking for a rate cut, we could be really greatly helped if the Fed would do its job and do a substantial rate cut."" He has previously called for a one percentage point cut.Mr Trump also spoke about continuing trade tensions with China, hinting that a deal with Beijing could still be some way off.""China's [economy] had the worst year they've had in 27 years. They want to make a deal with us, but I can tell you I'm not ready to make a deal unless they are going to make the right kind of deal."""
business	Does the US economy need a boost?	Why is the Fed expected to act?How has the US economy been doing?Does everyone think it is a good idea?Will this keep Mr Trump happy?	"The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected on Wednesday to cut rates for the first time since 2008.Traders expect a 0.25 percentage point cut, taking the federal funds target range to 2-2.25%.Supporters say it will spur a US economy showing signs of needing help.Critics argue that a rate cut will not help and that the Fed will be pandering to President Donald Trump, who is demanding a big cut.Inflation is lower than policymakers would like in the US, languishing at about 1.6% in June. The Fed targets 2%.Concerns about the US and global economy will also weigh on rate-setters' minds.Last week, the IMF cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for this year and next. US growth registered at an anaemic annual rate of 2.1% between April and June.US manufacturing, about a tenth of the economy, is the main sector under pressure. It slowed to a low of almost three years last month.Unemployment hit a 49-year low in May and was at 3.7% last month.But many of those jobs are in the service sector and are low-paying with low hours, says Megan Greene, an economist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.Often, low unemployment pushes wages up, and with more wages chasing the same products comes the inflation the Fed is looking for. But because the wages of the people being hired are low, that isn't happening. There is also the matter of the trade war with China, which threatens the world's economy.""None of this will be fixed"" by a small rate cut, Megan Greene says.""I think they will cut rates,"" said former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald Kohn, ""and I think there are good reasons for doing that.""While the economy ""looks pretty good"" and unemployment is low, ""I think there are some downside risks to growth, and inflation is running low so it's a good time to take out some insurance,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.Cutting rates makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and can lead to asset price inflation, or bubbles as that's known.Mr Kohn says the banking system is much stronger since the last crisis in 2007-9, which should lessen the risk of a similar crash.One area to watch is corporate debt, which has been growing, he says. US corporate debt, excluding lenders', stands at about $10tn (£8.23tn), up about a half from the crisis.However, when rates were at close to zero for the seven years after the crisis, it didn't spur much growth, said Ms Greene, leaving one to wonder what a 0.25 percentage point dent will do this time.Finally, what if it doesn't work? When another true crisis arrives, the central bank will want to cut rates again to stimulate growth and bolster business confidence.""If it doesn't do much - and I don't think it will - there's a risk of people not thinking it will work again.""No. On Tuesday President Trump called on the Federal Reserve to make a large interest rate cut, interpreted as larger than the expected 0.25.""I'm very disappointed in the Fed. I think they acted too quickly by far, and I think I've been proven right,"" Mr Trump said. ""The Fed is often wrong,"""
business	UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012	Why is the economy shrinking?What is the chancellor saying?What is happening to growth elsewhere?What does business say?How have economists reacted?What has happened to the pound?	"The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June.Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012.The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns.The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession.Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to €1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago.Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened.A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012.Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth.The economy had shown 0.5% growth in the first quarter after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s.The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March.The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth.Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU.""He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"".Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong.""The Bank said earlier this month it expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May.Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down.""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions.""He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures.""The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June.Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries.""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year.""But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"".""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.""The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit.""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson.Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal.""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October.""The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"".Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns.""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty.""As a result, business sentiment is dire.""The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late.""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"".Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"".Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic.He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"".The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released.The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor."
business	Tory manifesto a 'steady as she goes' document	Tight ship	"The Conservative Party manifesto contained no rabbits out of the hat, no huge tax cut - but a promise not to raise them - and no big new spending item.It has been designed as a ""steady as she goes"" modest effort - the equivalent of a rather low key Budget, with some targeted help.By design, the tax and spend numbers are just much smaller than Liberal Democrats' and especially Labour.Extra nurse recruitment and appointments cost about £1.5bn a year, on top of existing NHS commitments.In total there's £3bn in extra spending covered by a net tax rise of the same amount - the product of £6bn more in corporation tax revenue, and £2.5bn less from the National Insurance threshold rise.The big picture here is several billion a year, not several tens of billions.Indeed the difference in the Labour and Conservative manifesto costings document is laid bare by comparing total extra spending in 2023-24: Labour's manifesto offers (including day-to-day spending, investment spending and the annual cost of the promise to compensate women pensioners born in the 1950s) to increase spend more in one month (£12bn), than the Conservatives do in the whole year (£11bn).And both are perfectly happy to be defined as such. The Conservative team do not want to take any risks at all after the debacle of 2017. The Labour team judge the country is ready for a post-austerity big infrastructure investment and big state to deliver a low carbon economy.The Conservatives will accept £8bn of extra borrowing to fund investment spending on research, development and mending potholes. But the chancellor chose not to use greater space to do a lot more.So, for example, there is no listing of the capital spend for 40 new hospitals, nor for a high speed rail ""Northern Powerhouse"" rail link.The chancellor and prime minister want to keep a tight ship - a little bit more spending, yes, a bit more tax and borrowing too, but fractions of a percent of the economy.The calculation is that the public will not mind a minimalist manifesto, because it wants just a bit more spending in targeted priorities, and that delivering Brexit will get the votes the PM needs."
business	Hong Kong in first recession for a decade amid protests	Why are there protests in Hong Kong?Why the spike in anger?	"Hong Kong has confirmed it has entered its first recession for a decade as it continues to be gripped by protests.Its economy shrank 3.2% in the July-to-September period compared with the prior quarter, figures showed, confirming earlier preliminary data.It means the economy has contracted for two quarters in a row, which is the usual definition of a recession.Tourists are staying away and shops are suffering amid battles between anti-government protesters and police.""Domestic demand worsened significantly in the third quarter, as the local social incidents took a heavy toll on consumption-related activities and subdued economic prospects weighed on consumption and investment sentiment,"" the government said in a statement.It now expects the economy to shrink 1.3% for the full year.""Ending violence and restoring calm are pivotal to the recovery of the economy. The government will continue to closely monitor the situation and introduce measures as necessary to support enterprises and safeguard,"" the government added.Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption and a number of deaths.On Thursday, a 70-year-old cleaner died after he was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui.Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head.Dramatic scenes such as these have kept tourists away. In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003.Some hotels have slashed prices as they struggle to fill their rooms.On Thursday, two companies with major operations in Hong Kong revealed the financial impact of the protests.Luxury fashion house Burberry said its sales in Hong Kong had fallen by more than 10% and would ""remain under pressure"".Airline Cathay Pacific cut its profit guidance and said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.Monday's protests followed a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died last week.Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters.In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said.Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting the unpopular extradition bill that triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation."
business	Black Friday: US couple charge shoppers to queue	'Fun'	"A US couple is offering to camp out all night and hold places in the shopping queue for those who want to splurge on Black Friday deals.""My husband has great ways of thinking when it comes to money,"" says Alexis Granados, of her partner Steven Velasquez.He recently lost his job as a scale operator for a recycling company.The pair are charging $50 (£38) each to wait outside any store in Upland, California, the night before the Black Friday sales.Being paid to queue is not new - but part of a growing phenomenon within what is commonly known as the gig economy.On Task Rabbit and Bidvine, UK sites that advertise services from the self-employed, people can earn between £15 and £20 a time.Meanwhile, Placer, an app available in the US has been created solely to cater for people who are too busy to queue and willing to pay others to do it for them.An estimated 165.3 million people are expected to hit the shops in the US between Friday and Monday, the National Retail Federation says.The shopping bonanza, which originated in America, falls on the Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday - when workers in the US usually have the day off.And the California-based Granados couple say the work will help them to make ends meet. They are looking for more traditional jobs, but in the meantime say they're happy to pick up odd jobs where they can.Neither have done anything like this before, but she says ""I'm pretty sure it won't be our last time. It's actually easy money when you think about it"".The couple have a car, where they can warm up during their queuing time.They are advertising their queuing service on social media and several people have expressed an interest. The duo guarantee a good place in the queue and if their customer is not satisfied they say they will not charge for the service.""We used to be homeless, so it is not really a pain for us,"" says Ms Granados, saying the money means a lot to them.Currently the young couple, who are in their 20s, have a housing voucher that helped them get off the street. ""It was actually a stepping stone for us and helped us grow as adults,"" says Ms Granados.Housing assistance in the US is offered to people with incomes under a certain threshold who need help finding a place to live.With a housing voucher, people can secure a place in social housing."
business	China's economy grows at slowest pace since 1990s	AnalysisGlobal impact	"China's economy grew at its slowest pace since the early 1990s in the second quarter, official figures showed.In the three months to June, the economy grew 6.2% from a year earlier. The result was in line with forecasts.China has moved to stimulate its economy this year by boosting spending and delivering tax cuts.The country is also fighting a trade war with the US which has hurt businesses and weighed on growth.The data released on Monday showed China's economic growth rate slowed from 6.4% in the first three months of the year.US President Donald Trump tweeted that US trade tariffs were having ""a major effect"" on the Chinese economy.China's national statistics bureau said the figures pointed to a ""complex environment"" both at home and abroad.It said the economy had ""performed within the reasonable range"" in the first half of 2019, but that it faced ""new downward pressure"".Andrew Walker, business correspondentThe figures do show some impact from the trade conflict with the US. Growth has probably slowed a little more than it would have done had China been facing a more tranquil international commercial environment. The longer-term picture, though, is one of an economy continuing a reasonably orderly and intended slowdown in growth.The average growth rate over the three decades to 2010 was 10%. The Chinese leadership - and every economist I have ever heard expressing a view on this - did not regard that as sustainable for the long term. The aim was to see the economy less dependent on investment and exports and an increased role for spending by consumers.There has been some progress, though the rates of saving and investment remain very high. There are dangers, however, notably the high level of company debt. The authorities encouraged strong credit growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. That has helped prevent a more rapid and potentially disruptive slowdown, but at the price of creating additional financial risks.While China-watchers advise caution with Beijing's official gross domestic product numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory.Other data showed some signs of improvement in the world's second-largest economy.Industrial production rose 6.3% in June from a year earlier, while retail sales rose 9.8% year-on-year - both above forecasts in Reuters polls.Slowing growth in China has raised concerns about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy.Earlier this year Beijing announced plans to boost spending and cut billions of dollars in taxes in an effort to support the economy.It has also moved to provide a liquidity boost by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the latest economic data ""shows the slowdown remains intact and markets should expect further stimulus"" from China's central bank later this year.The US-led trade war is another factor weighing on growth.""The trade war is having a huge impact on the Chinese economy, and with no end sight as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress, we are probably not near the bottom for China's economy,"" he said.While both sides agreed to resume trade talks at a recent G20 summit in Japan, they have already placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods, hurting businesses and casting a shadow over the world economy."
business	New cracks in the global economy as exports tumble	Canary in the coal mine?The trade war effectWhat happens next?	"If you were in any doubt that the US-China trade war is having an impact on Asia, look no further than Singapore's latest export figures.Singapore saw exports fall for a second month in a row, this time by 17.3% in the month of June compared to a year ago.This dramatic fall comes as Singapore's growth figures released last week showed a 3.4% decline in growth in comparison to the last quarter.So why should you care if Singapore is selling less of its stuff to the world than it used to?The city state is one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world, and is often seen as a global indicator for trade.Analysts are calling Singapore's data the ""canary in the coal mine"", a reference to a well-worn expression to indicate there is danger ahead.The phrase comes from when miners used to carry caged canaries into mine shafts, to let them know if it was dangerous. The canaries would die if there was even a hint of poisonous gas in the mines, providing a warning signal for the miners to get out.The worry among Asia-watchers is that Singapore's numbers are just a sign of more bad news to come from the rest of the region.There is increasing evidence to show that Asia's economies are being hit by the US-China trade war.""Around the region it is a similar story,"" says Song Seng Wun, South East Asia economist for CIMB Private Bank.""This trade war is coming at a time when global growth is slowing down after ten years of relatively stable times. Even if by some miracle a fairy taps her magic wand and the trade war disappears, all that would happen is that things would just be less bad - rather than really bad.""Data from India, Indonesia and South Korea reads like a list of bad news. June was a particularly gloomy month for the three countries.India saw exports fall by 9.7%, the first time in nine months.Indonesia, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also saw exports fall by 8.98% in comparison with the same period last year. And South Korea also saw exports fall by 13.5%.All of these countries sell products ranging from palm oil and chemicals to semiconductor chips to China.This week China posted the lowest quarterly growth it has seen in close to three decades, partly on trade war worries.US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods now cover more than half of what China sells to the US. Which means that Chinese companies either have to cut their costs for their buyers, or sell less to the US.And that means the countries supplying Chinese factories with products are also getting hit.It doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon.A report from the Japanese research house Nomura released this week on Asian exports shows that exports ""should remain in the doldrums in the coming month"".Nomura blames this on the ""lack of progress on US-China trade negotiations"", heightened global uncertainty weighing on corporate investment decisions and signs that trade protectionism is being used as a ""weapon of foreign policy"" around the region.It isn't entirely clear yet when or if the US-China trade war will come to a resolution - or whether this is the start of a ""broader shift in US policy away from free trade"", as think tank Capital Economics points out.Mr Trump has already indicated that Vietnam - which up to now has been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war - could be next on his tariff list, and economists say Taiwan and South Korea could also be next in line.Asia is home to the world's next generation of companies and consumers.By 2050 it could see its share of the global economy grow to 52%, according to the Asian Development Bank - which means the region would also be the main driver of global growth.But analysts say if the US's anti-free trade trend continues and hits more of Asia's economies, that could hurt the region's long term potential growth rate - in turn hurting the rest of us."
business	UK economy returns to growth but slowdown fears persist	Analysis	"The UK economy returned to growth in May after shrinking in April, but the news failed to allay fears of a future slowdown.The economy grew 0.3% from the month before, after declining 0.4% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Growth for the three months to May was 0.3%, with all sectors showing growth.But economists say that June's growth figures will have to be strong to avoid contraction in the second quarter.A partial recovery in car production, which had fallen sharply in April, was the main reason for the economy's upturn in May, said Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS.Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit had slashed UK car production in April by nearly half.However, despite this rebound, the levels of output in the car industry are below those seen in the months leading up to April 2019, the ONS said.""GDP grew moderately in the latest three months, with IT, communications and retail showing strength. Despite this, there has been a longer-term slowdown in the often-dominant services sector since summer 2018,"" Mr Kent-Smith added.In May, growth in services was flat, following growth of 0.1% in April.Faisal Islam, economics editorA return to work in car factories that shut down in preparation for a no-deal Brexit drove a return to growth in the economy in May of 0.3%. But that rise did not make up for all the fall in the previous month.Monthly figures are volatile and should be taken with a pinch of salt. However, against a backdrop of a marked softening in a slew of surveys of manufacturing, services and retail, there is an indication of an economy stalling and possibly contracting in the second quarter that has just ended, between April and June.In the three months till May, however, growth was higher than expected because of a better March than had been previously calculated.The impact of stockpiling, though, can clearly be seen in the big economic figures. Sterling has fallen more than 5% in recent weeks against the world's three major currencies, on expectation of lower interest rates for longer, political uncertainty and rising expectations of a no-deal Brexit.Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the latest figures suggested the economy grew overall in the second quarter, although probably at a much slower rate than the 0.5% recorded in the January-to-March period.Those second-quarter figures, covering April to June, are due to be released on 9 August.""Storm clouds look to be gathering over the UK economy, as consumers and business remain hamstrung by Brexit uncertainty,"" he added.Last month, the Bank of England said it expected economic growth to be flat in the second quarter of the year."
business	How important will blockchain be to the world's economy?	More Things That Made the Modern Economy:	"The Long Island Iced Tea Company, as its name suggests, was in the business of selling beverages. And not as many as it might have liked: it lost nearly $4m (£3.2m) in the third quarter of 2017.Then the company announced that it would henceforth be known as the Long Blockchain Corporation. Would it stop selling beverages? No. Would it sell beverages using blockchain? Maybe. It would do something to do with blockchain. Maybe. Probably.The details were hazy, but that did not stop investors getting excited.What is blockchain? And what does it have to do with Long Island Iced Tea?Blockchain is the technology which underpins Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It is a database of financial transactions which is saved on multiple computers and which constantly grows as new transactions or ""blocks"" are added to it, forming a continuous and public chain of data.Blockchain may still be in its infancy, but venture capitalists are already pouring billions into start-ups with more clearly defined plans than the Long Island Iced Tea Company's. Even Facebook is getting involved.And billions more are being raised in the regulatory grey area of initial coin offerings, where companies raise money by selling digital currency to investors.Enthusiasts say blockchain could become as disruptive as the internet, comparing the technology to the World Wide Web in the 1990s. At that time, many people were clear it would become important - but few really understood it, or foresaw its potential and limitations.So what problem is blockchain trying to solve, and should we believe the hype?50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Let's start with a deceptively simple question: what stops me from spending the same money twice?When money meant physical tokens, it was easy. I can't give the same one to two different people. But long ago we realised that lugging coins around is no way to run an economy. It is easier to trust third parties to keep records of who has got what.You give me goods, and I instruct the record keepers to shuffle their numbers accordingly.How do you know I have not given the same money to someone else? You trust the bank, or MasterCard, or PayPal, to guarantee that cannot happen - because their systems will not allow it.But there can be drawbacks.These third parties - intermediaries - need paying. And the more retailers who use a service such as MasterCard, the more attractive it is to customers. The more customers who use it, the more attractive it is to retailers. This is known as a ""network effect"".It can make these intermediaries very powerful. If they fail, the whole system collapses.What if we didn't need them? What if the financial records which lubricate the global economy could somehow be communally owned and maintained?In 2008, someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a new kind of money: Bitcoin. Transactions would be verified not by a trusted third party like a bank or credit card provider, but by a network of computers solving cryptographic puzzles.And as long as enough people chipped in computing power to check the solution, nobody would be able to fake the records or carry out fraudulent transactions. And individuals were incentivised to donate that power by the promise of Bitcoin rewards.It was ingenious. And people soon wondered whether blockchain, the technology making all this possible, could do more. It offered a completely new way for strangers to collaborate without needing to trust a centralised authority. We started to hear phrases like ""transform everything"" and ""change the world"".In theory, blockchain could help lower the costs of verifying transactions and creating new markets, whenever we trust a person or company to manage our information in ways which help us interact with each other.What are Facebook, Uber and Amazon, for example, if not databases which use our information to help us interact? Might blockchain one day build new online models where we own our data, or perhaps sell our attention directly? Some think so.Others are working on blockchains to track goods through supply chains, or intellectual property in the digital world; to make contracts quicker to administer, or voting systems more secure. You name it, somebody somewhere will be trying to put it on a blockchain.But let's be honest: most of us do not understand the nuts and bolts of these ideas. And even if we do, we cannot confidently envisage how they will play out in reality.Predictably, the combination of intense buzz and hard-to-grasp technology has meant some people have not thought as critically as perhaps they should.Like those who rushed to buy shares in a loss-making drinks company when it puts the word ""blockchain"" in its name. Or who bid up the total value of ""DogeCoin"" - a joke Bitcoin rival - to more than $2bn.Or who sank $660m into something called Pincoin, seemingly based on little more than a glitzy website. The people behind Pincoin appear to have taken the money and vanished.Just how excited should blockchain make us?The economist Tyler Cowen is cautious: he reckons ""scepticism is more plausible than enthusiasm"" - for now, at least. One reason: blockchains can be slow and power-hungry.Bitcoin, for example, chugs through three or four transactions a second. Visa averages 1,600. To validate these transactions, the computers solving Bitcoin's cryptographic puzzles consume, by one estimate, about as much electricity as Ireland.Some dispute the significance of these figures, but the technological challenge of scaling blockchains seems real. So is the problem of marrying data to real world humans.One of Bitcoin's attractions is that your wallet is not linked to your real identity - especially if you are using it to purchase dodgy stuff. But if we want to use blockchains to store medical records, we have to be certain that they cannot get attached to the wrong patient.In removing the need for intermediaries, blockchains may sometimes remind us why their services can be worth paying for.Intermediaries can fix mistakes. Your bank can send a replacement internet banking login. Lose the passcode to your Bitcoin wallet, and you can kiss your currency goodbye.They can also resolve disputes. How best to do that with blockchain ""smart contracts"" is most kindly described as an evolving conversation.And trust in an intermediary has to be replaced by trust in other things - that software is reliable, and that incentive structures will not break down in unexpected circumstances.But assessing software is hard. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a pioneering investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain, raised $150m before someone hacked it, and stole $50m.The economist Eric Budish suggests there are limits to how valuable Bitcoin can become before the incentives to attack it outweigh the incentives that currently keep attackers at bay.But it is only a decade since blockchain was invented. Should we not expect some wrong moves and false starts before we figure out what it is good for?When the World Wide Web was a similar age, it was certainly better established and further advanced - but investors were still pouring money into Webvan, Flooz and Pets.com, as well as eventual successes like Amazon.It shouldn't surprise us that shares in the Long Blockchain Corporation promptly crashed by 96%.But nor should it make us too cynical about what might one day be possible.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	What's gone wrong with Brazil's economy?	1. There's no economic recovery in sight2. The unemployment problem isn't being solved3. The currency and stock market have dashed post-election hopes4. Still mired in debt	"On 1 January, when Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro took office, many in the country were concerned that the divisive politician would not be able to bring the country together.But one sector was almost unanimous in praising Mr Bolsonaro's rise to power: business people.Brazil's president boasted during the election that he did not understand anything about economics.Once in power, he delegated all decisions on the subject to businessman Paulo Guedes, who became a ""super-minister"" of the economy.The task of rescuing Brazil's economy from the brink of yet another recession was urgent. The economy is still at the same level it was back in 2014.Markets were excited at the prospects of liberal reforms to come.But expectations soon started to fall apart. A series of government blunders - political infighting inside the administration, a clumsy attempt at state intervention in Brazil's fuel policy and the lack of leadership in Congress - hampered growth expectations.Most analysts have halved their growth expectations for Brazil and now believe significant growth will not start until 2020.Here is a look at some of the key figures that suggest Brazil's economy is not moving forward.In the previous decade, Brazil was lauded (along with Russia, India, China and South Africa) as one of the Brics powers - emerging economies with superfast rates of economic growth that would surpass developed economies by 2050.The economic performance of this decade, however, suggests Brazil does not belong in that league.A crippling two-year recession in 2015 and 2016 saw the country's economy contract by almost 7%.Economic recovery has been sluggish. In 2017 and 2018, the economy grew at a meagre pace of 1.1% a year.And there is still more bad news: since the beginning of the year, economists have more than halved their expectations of economic growth for 2019 to a rate not very different from that seen in the past two years.Brazilian workers are the ones paying the price.The number of unemployed people has increased from 7.6 million in 2012 to 13.4 million this year.Mr Bolsonaro thinks these numbers actually underestimate the real picture. He believes the situation is worse.The official unemployment survey shows that 28.3 million people are under-utilised - which means they are either not working or working less than they could.There are fewer people with formal jobs, while wages are barely keeping up with inflation - which has been brutal. Since the beginning of Brazil's recession four years ago, prices have gone up by 25%.During much of the election, the Brazil's currency - the real - rallied strongly as it became clear that Mr Bolsonaro would win the election.It was a clear sign of confidence from investors abroad.A poll by Bloomberg late last year among chief international strategists saw Brazil top the list of best bets in three categories: foreign exchange, bonds and stocks.After almost five months, prospects are now bleak.Both the stock exchange and the currency - which usually anticipate the pace in the real economy - are close to the same level they were at the beginning of this year.Brazil's stock exchange hit an all-time high in March this year, but has returned most of its gains following disappointing corporate results.So why is Brazil in such a mess in the first place?The main consensus among market analysts - and also people in Mr Bolsonaro's government - is that the country started spending too much money around 2013, during the leftist government of Dilma Rousseff.Since then, one of the main thermometers of Brazil's economy has been the fiscal deficit - the amount of money spent beyond the country's revenues.Ms Rousseff was impeached amid allegations that she masked Brazil's fiscal deficit to hide how much her government was overspending.Since her downfall, all efforts from the government have gone into lowering this fiscal deficit.Some economists say the main culprit is the pension system, with Brazilians retiring too early (some in their early 50s) and with too many benefits (especially amongst civil servants).Mr Bolsonaro is proposing pension cuts and a minimal retirement age of 65 for men and 62 for women.During the boom years, Brazil had a debt which was 51% the size of its economy.The growing fiscal deficit raised the debt level to 77.1%.The government says that if nothing is done, the country's debt will be the size of its entire economy by 2023."

"Narendra Modi has secured a historic second election victory.Indian stocks and the rupee rose to welcome the news: another parliamentary majority for the BJP party could grant Mr Modi the opportunity to make promised reforms a reality.But once the euphoria around his emphatic win at the polls has faded, there will remain some tough economic challenges in his in-tray.The economic record for Mr Modi's first term in office is mixed.He initiated some bold reforms, such as a new bankruptcy law, to help tackle a rise bad debts that was putting pressure on the banking sector.His government reduced red tape, helping move India to 77th in the World Bank's 2019 Doing Business ranking, an improvement from 134th place when he first took office in 2014.India also became the world's fastest growing economy during that first term.But his biggest gamble, banning more than three quarters of the rupee notes in circulation in order to battle corruption, misfired and delivered a significant blow to economic growth. Without replacement notes ready in time, India's gigantic informal economy was temporarily crippled - leading to job losses.The rollout of a new national sales tax didn't go smoothly either. In the long run the new tax is expected to boost economic growth by streamlining a multitude of complicated taxes into a single tax. But in the short term glitches around its introduction had a severe impact on millions of small and medium-sized businesses.As Mr Modi gets his feet back under the desk for his second term, economists like Surjit Bhalla believe that his increased majority will give Mr Modi more freedom to take tough decisions.""Given the size of the mandate, we can expect bolder reforms during the next five years,"" says Mr Bhalla, who served on the prime minister's economic advisory council during Mr Modi's first term.But the scale of India's problems matches that mandate.Economic growth slowed to 6.6% in the three months to December 2018, the slowest rate for six quarters.According to a leaked government report, unemployment touched a 45-year high between 2016 and 2017.Experts say that Mr Modi needs to spur flagging private sector investment in order to boost job creation. His flagship Make in India programme, aimed at giving manufacturing a big boost, has yielded mixed results so far.Ajit Ranade, chief economist of Mumbai-based, Aditya Birla Group, believes that focusing on overseas markets is the key to creating more employment opportunities.""Exports and manufacturing are intertwined. Unless exports grow the manufacturing sector won't expand,"" he says.The new government should focus on labour-intensive sectors like construction, tourism, textiles and agricultural products, he adds.Unlike China, India's economic growth has been driven by domestic consumption over the last fifteen years. But data released over the last few months suggests that consumer spending is slowing.Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year low. Tractor, motorbike and scooter sales are down. Demand for bank credit has sputtered. Hindustan Unilever has reported slower revenue growth in the most recent quarter. All of these are important benchmarks for measuring consumer appetite.Mr Modi's party promised in its manifesto that it would cut income tax to ensure more cash and greater purchasing power stayed in the hands of middle-income families.However, given the current state of government finances, that may not be possible immediately. India's 3.4% budget deficit - the gap between government expenditure and revenue - may restrict Mr Modi's options.""The widening fiscal deficit is a slow-acting poison,"" says Mr Ranade. He believes this will hold back medium and long-term growth.The agrarian crisis was a constant challenge for Mr Modi during his first term. Farmers across the country protested on the streets, demanding higher prices for their crops.Small-scale farmers have been promised more support, but structural changes to the way the market works might be preferable to measures that will put additional pressure on the government's already stretched budget, argues Ila Patnaik, a former economic advisor to the government of India.She would like to see the end of the system whereby farmers are required to sell their products to state-owned agencies at a fixed price.""We need to free up the farmers so that they can sell products to whoever they want. This will also encourage them to move to high value products,"" she says.One of his headline election pledges was a promise to spend $1.44 trillion to build roads, railways and other infrastructure. But such an eye-watering sum will have to come from somewhere. Many observers expect privatisation to play a key role.Mr Modi made slow progress on his pledges to sell off government enterprises in his first term. The government did initiate the process of selling a majority stake in national carrier Air India, but with a tepid response from investors, the plan failed to take off.Mr Bhalla expects Mr Modi to pursue privatisation more aggressively in his second term.""The next two years is a good time for the government to [speed up] the process of privatisation,"" he argues.And he believes a willingness to embrace bolder policies could entice more foreign investors to put their money in India.""During his first term, Mr Modi has shown the appetite to take up tough reforms and he will definitely try to take even bigger risks during his second term,"" he says."
business	Japan economy beats expectations of slowdown		"Japan's economy unexpectedly grew in the three months to March, shrugging off forecasts for a contraction in the world's third largest economy.The economy grew at an annualised 2.1% in the period, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed.That beat analyst expectations for a 0.2% contraction, as imports fell faster than exports.The data were closely watched for any signals a planned sales tax rise could be delayed.The surprise expansion in the official GDP figure was fuelled mostly by imports falling faster than exports.Imports slid 4.6% - the biggest fall in a decade, according to Reuters - while exports dropped more than a 2.4%.""The surprising resilience of the economy at the start of the year means that GDP growth will be stronger this year than we had anticipated,"" senior Japan economist at Capital Economics Marcel Thieliant said.Mr Thieliant also said that following the better-than-expected growth figures Japan ""will press ahead with the sales tax hike scheduled for 1 October"".Some policymakers have called for a delay to the sales tax increase from 8% to 10% given a backdrop of uncertain domestic and global economic conditions.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already delayed the planned increase and uncertainties in the world economy - including slowing growth in China and its trade war with the US - have prompted some concern that it may be delayed again.But the country's Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi appeared to indicate that the plans for higher sales tax remained on track.""There's no change to our view that the fundamentals supporting domestic demand remain solid,"" Mr Motegi told reporters, according to Reuters."
business	UK growth 'slowest in almost a decade'	What happened in the three-month period?What happened in September?How did the different parts of the economy perform?What does it tell us about the economy?Was Brexit stockpiling important?What are the politicians saying?	"Britain's economy has grown at the slowest annual rate in almost a decade, according to official figures.Year-on-year growth in the three months to end-September slowed to 1% from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.An ONS spokesman said: ""Looking at the picture over the last year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade.""But the economy avoided a recession by growing 0.3% in the third quarter.The economy had shrunk in the second quarter and two quarters of contraction would have signalled a recession.Despite the economy expanding by 0.3% in the third quarter, it was not as fast as the 0.4% forecast by economists, including at the Bank of England.A statistician at the ONS said GDP grew ""steadily"" in the third quarter. That was largely as a result of a ""strong July"".""The underlying trade deficit narrowed, mainly due to growing exports of both goods and services.""In the month of September, GDP fell by 0.1%, as had been expected.But the ONS revised down the contraction in August to 0.2% from 0.1%.It was the growth of 0.3% in July that drove the economy in the whole of the third quarter.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The fact that growth was positive in the third quarter was largely due to a strong July.""Output then fell back in August and September, which points to a lack of momentum in the economy going into the fourth quarter.""The statistician at the ONS said: ""Services again led the way, with construction also performing well.""Manufacturing failed to grow, as falls in many industries were offset by car production bouncing back following April shutdowns.""The ONS said the construction sector showed its first positive growth for a rolling three-month period since May.Production was flat in the three months to September and has not shown growth over a rolling three-month period since April.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The dominant services sector was the main driver of GDP growth in the quarter with industrial production and construction sectors adding little to overall UK GDP growth.""Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy avoided a recession in the third quarter, the economy was ""pretty soft"".""The GDP figures suggest that the economy failed to regain much momentum after the the second-quarter contraction.""Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that ""a return to growth is welcome news, but narrowly avoiding a recession is nothing to celebrate"".""The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with growth punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines,"" he added.Ms Gregory added: ""While the election is just under five weeks away, clearly this isn't the good news the government might have hoped for.""The economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter - the March to June period - when Brexit stockpiles were unwound after the first Brexit date of 29 March.Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a ""renewed stockpiling boost"" failed to materalise in the third quarter.""It possible that stockpiling occurred to a greater extent at the start of the fourth quarter,"" he said, adding fourth-quarter growth might not be depressed to the extent he expected.But Mr Parikh said that ""the final quarter of 2019 could be weaker as stockpiles continue to be run down"".The Chancellor, Sajid Javid, said there figures were ""another welcome sign that the fundamentals of the UK economy are strong. Under the conservatives, we've seen nine consecutive years of growth"".He added: ""What it also shows is the real risk to growth in our economy is Corbyn's Labour. If they get their way, two referendums in 2020, eye watering amounts of spending and borrowing and debt, that kind of economic vandalism will bring growth in this country to a halt.""But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: ""The fact that the government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six months is a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy are.""Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader said: ""The economy under the Tories is anaemic.""As much as it would be a relief that a formal recession has been avoided, the picture is very sluggish, in keeping with what has been called a ""slow puncture"" economy.Growth of 0.3% between July and September is clearly preferable to another quarter of contraction, but still slow by normal historical standards.Indeed, comparing the third quarter this year with the same period last year, growth of just 1% is the slowest since the aftermath of the financial crisis. It is the weakest two quarters since the financial crisis.The background is a slower European and world economy reeling from trade wars.But years of damaged business investment, after the Brexit referendum, are taking their toll on growth.The latest figures in the month of September showed a contraction of 0.1%. Data has been volatile this year, with car industry shutdowns and two bouts of ultimately unneeded no-deal Brexit stockpiling.So recession avoided, but this is not the ""bounce back"" promised by some."
business	Can old fridges be recycled to make new ones?		"As a result of Black Friday many old fridges will be replaced. But what happens to your old fridge, which by law must be disposed of by an approved contractor? Dougal Shaw went to the UK's largest fridge recycling plant to find out.It's like a graveyard for fridges.They are stacked up in columns about six appliances high and this arrangement forms a maze around the industrial site.If you've got rid of an old fridge in the past few years, there's a good chance it's ended up here.The AO Recycling plant in Telford receives 700,000 fridges every year - almost a quarter of the UK's total.The peak season is summer, when fridges tend to fail and get replaced. The other spike is around Black Friday, when many people decide to replace their white goods, if they sniff a deal.The fridges arrive from AO.com's own customers, but also from other retailers and councils.It's been law to dispose of fridges through an approved contractor since 2002 - not least because of the greenhouse gases they contain.Sort then smashAppliances at the plant are first vetted to see if they were retired too early - could they be repaired and resold?If not, their compressor is stripped out. This contains the motor and pump, as well as the refrigerant, the substance which flows around fridges to keep them cool. This needs to be extracted, as it is potentially harmful to the environment.Then a conveyor belt will tip the fridges into a machine known as Bertha, eight at a time.Bertha is the size of a two-story house and you can't see what goes on inside her.First oxygen is sucked out in a sealed chamber so that further greenhouse gases can be recovered from the fridges' insulation foam.Then the fridges fall into another chamber where huge metal chains, like the kind you see holding ships at the docks, whip the white goods at 500 revolutions per minute.This beating reduces them to shreds of plastic and metal, which machines can then separate.However, this rather crude material does not have great potential for recycling - it can only be used to make a few items, like seed pots for plants, for example.So at the moment the final resting place for old fridges may well be in your garden, or perhaps an allotment.'The holy grail'The vast majority of new fridges are manufactured from virgin polymer, derived from crude oil, a dwindling natural resource.This is partly because much of the plastic used in fridges needs to be ""food grade"" to meet safety standards - but also, manufacturers don't want to risk the slightest imperfection creeping into their vast production lines, which run on tight profit margins.Virgin polymers might not be good for the environment, but they are a tried and tested way of getting high quality plastic.""The holy grail,"" explains John Roberts, founder and CEO of AO.com, ""is to add the material recovered from the old fridges back into the supply chain once again, to make new fridges.""This is why his company has just opened a new factory five minutes' drive from the Telford recycling plant, to see if high quality, food-grade plastic can in fact be recovered from old fridges.The new production line is about half the length of a football pitch.A series of machines tries to whittle down the crude fridge waste to recover just the pure, single polymer, food-grade white plastic they want.Water tanks sift out the denser materials, like metals, which sink.Electrostatic machines can separate the various types of plastic in the mix.An optical machine is also used to sort material by colour - the same kind of machine used in peanut factories for quality testing.What comes out at the end of this process are pellets of white plastic, of high purity.However, they are not yet quite pure enough - each batch is tested and so far the results are in the very high 90s - but not quite 100% food-grade quality plastic.A manufacturer's viewIf the technique is perfected, is there an appetite to turn fridge recycling into what's known as a circular economy - feeding the old fridge material back into the supply chain?The mood of manufacturers might be changing, according to Hakan Bulgurlu, chief executive of Arçelik, the global white good manufacturers who own fridge brands like Beko and Grundig.His company manufactures more than 18 million new fridges every year.In the past his marketing teams and engineers would tell him that customers want pristine fridges made of virgin polymers, says Bulgurlu. They told him people would dislike the idea of fridges made from recycled materials.That perception is now reversing, he thinks, as manufacturers realise there is public appetite for white goods that wear their environmental credentials on their sleeves, even if these products cost slightly more.His company tries to use recycled plastic in its production line, he says, but it is a challenge with fridges in particular, because the parts of them which come into contact with food need to be made from food-grade plastic.By contrast, they have already managed to make a vacuum cleaner that is made of 90% recycled plastic.Beko is investing in bioplastics, made from corn husk, which don't use crude oil and can biodegrade, says Bulgurlu. So far they have made one fridge where 25% of its plastic is sourced this way.The real holy grail, he says, ""is a fridge that you can bury and two years later it has disappeared"".Follow Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"
business	UK economy rebounds in first quarter	What impact has Brexit had on the figures?Is the economy stabilising?What do the trade figures tell us about the economy?	"The UK economy picked up in the first three months of the year after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth.Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said.The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period.The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the original Brexit deadline of 29 March.Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March.Previous business surveys had shown manufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexit in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders.As well as manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the UK was due to leave the EU, firms also stockpiled parts.This drove a surge in imports, with the total trade deficit - the gap between what the UK imports and exports - doubling in the first quarter to a record high, separate data from the ONS showed.The total trade deficit widened from £8.9bn to £18.3bn, driven partly by a sharp increase in imports of cars and gold.However, the UK's deadline to exit the EU has since been extended until the end of October after Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for more time to negotiate a deal.Chancellor Philip Hammond said the figures showed the economy remained ""robust"".""These GDP figures this morning show again that the UK economy is performing robustly, despite the evidence of slowing global growth and the continued Brexit uncertainty at home - so it's good news,"" he told the BBC.But analysts have warned the impact of Brexit could mean the pick-up in growth is short-lived.Tej Parikh, senior economist at business lobby group the Institute of Directors, said it could well be just ""a flash in the pan"".""Some businesses brought activity forward early this year in preparation for leaving the EU, so higher stocks and earlier orders have artificially bumped up the growth numbers.""In the second quarter, many firms will be keen to run down their Brexit caches, which will drag on economic growth,"" he said.But Ruth Gregory, senior UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the figures offered some ""encouraging signs that underlying growth gained some pace"".She said household consumption growth was ""solid"" and pointed out that business investment grew ""for the first time in four quarters"".There's something upbeat in today's figures and also something downbeat, quite possibly with the same cause.In spite of all the political fuss, the economy grew better than it has in a while. At 1.8% for the year, it is almost at pre-financial crisis rates, when growth of 2-3% a year was normal.The figures can be taken to confirm predictions that there would be a boost to economic growth from ""stockpiling"" - firms spending more than usual building up their stocks of supplies, just in case a no-deal Brexit meant cross-border trade seized up.Manufacturing enjoyed a boost and more cars were imported than usual. You can't tell from these figures alone, but that may also be due to stockpiling: a ""buy-now-while-stocks-last"" effect in case the pound dropped (making imported cars more expensive) and tariffs were imposed (ditto).But here's the downer. Partly due to higher imports, the trade deficit doubled, from £8.9bn to £18.3bn. Because we enjoy a surplus in services, exporting more than we import, it looks even worse when you strip out services.The trade in goods deficit in the first quarter widened to a record: £43.3bn including non-monetary gold, which rose by £6bn.We know from numerous economic studies: people buy gold when they're worried. It looks like, in the first quarter of the year, economic growth was lifted - by anxiety. It's small, but you might call it a mini ""worry-boom""."
business	UK economy hit by 'dramatic' fall in car output	'Hangover'Analysis:'Sluggish growth'	"A ""dramatic"" fall in car production and an easing of stockpiling by manufacturers meant the economy shrank in April, official figures show.The economy contracted 0.4% from the month before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The contraction meant growth for the three months to April slowed to 0.3%.Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit slashed UK car production in April by nearly half, the industry said last month.BMW's Mini factory in Oxford brought forward its summer maintenance shutdown to April to minimise any disruption surrounding Brexit. Other manufacturers' annual stoppages were also brought forward.The economy had seen a spurt of growth in the run-up to the proposed March date for the UK leaving the European Union, as manufacturers stockpiled parts, raw materials and goods in the anticipation of holdups at the border.After the Brexit deadline was extended to October, it suffered the reverse effects as these supply reserves were used up and fewer purchases were made.""The hangover that's followed the UK's original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated, said Yael Selfin, chief economist at accountants KPMG UK.""Today's figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty.""ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said: ""Growth showed some weakening across the latest three months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns.""There was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK's original EU departure date has faded.""By Jonty Bloom, business correspondentIf you are going to cancel a party it is always polite to give your guests as much notice as possible. After all, that could well save them the expense of buying a present, booking a baby sitter, splashing out on new clothes etc.Unfortunately Theresa May gave British industry only a few days' notice that Brexit was being postponed and it was just too late to stop carefully-honed plans swinging into operation.Many businesses feared Brexit would cause at least temporary disruption, so they had been stockpiling components and finished goods to tide them over, and they have been using those stores up rather than producing more.The car industry brought forward its annual shutdown - usually used to put in new equipment, prepare for new models and so on. As a result, car production fell off a cliff and manufacturing as a whole fell by nearly 4% in just one month.Growth may bounce back, but then Brexit is now scheduled for 31 October. How do companies plan for that? Repeat the whole operation again or not bother? Certainly the car industry won't want another shutdown, it has already had one this year and Brexit could still be delayed again.The contraction in April was far sharper than economists had expected.Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest ""underlying growth is pretty sluggish"".""With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year.""The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has estimated car production for the whole of 2019 will be about 10% down on last year. It says the market might pick up by the end of the year if there is a favourable deal between the UK and the EU, and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market.But it has said a no-deal Brexit will make the declines worse, with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs.The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""While monthly figures are always changeable, the fundamentals of our economy are strong and it has grown every year since 2010. Employment levels are at a record high and wages growing in real terms."""
business	India loses place as world's fastest-growing economy	'Jobs crisis'	"India has lost its spot as the world's fastest-growing major economy after it grew more slowly than expected in the first three months of 2019.Official data showed the economy grew 5.8%, which is slower than the 6.4% growth registered by China, and down from 6.6% in the previous quarter.It was the first set of figures since Narendra Modi secured a second election victory this month.During his first term, India became the world's fastest-growing economy.But the latest figures, which show the slowest growth rate in 17 quarters, mean India's growth rate has fallen behind China for the first time in nearly two years.Economists had been expecting the economy to grow 6.3% in the first quarter.The figures will put pressure on Prime Minister Modi's government and the central bank to provide stimulus to the economy through fiscal measures.Unlike China, India's economic growth has been driven by domestic consumption over the last 15 years and the latest data showed weaker consumer demand.There was also a slower growth in investment, which fell to 3.6% from 10.6% in the previous quarter.Finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said that the next quarter - the three months of April to June - could also be ""relatively slower"".But, it should start to turnaround in the third quarter, he said.The Reserve Bank of India is now expected to cut interest rates next month.Unemployment data, that has been repeatedly delayed, was also issued on Friday and showed a rate of 6.1% in the 2017/18 fiscal year.""It shows the jobs crisis is still there: there are not many new ones being created,"" said NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several year and chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters ""it would be unfair to compare it with the past."""
business	What Trump wants from global trade	Global Trade	"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally.He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"".Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office.It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018.Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more.That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods.So a success for President Trump? Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't.Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods.There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services.It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers."
business	Audi to cut 9,500 jobs to fund electric car push		"Carmaker Audi is to cut 9,500 of its 61,000 jobs in Germany between now and 2025 to make more money available for electric vehicles and digital working.The cuts - which aim to save €6bn (£5.1bn) - will be achieved through an early retirement programme.But the Volkswagen-owned firm also said its move into electric cars would mean the creation of up to 2,000 jobs.It comes less than a fortnight after Daimler said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs by the end of 2022.The car industry is facing a downturn in key markets, including China, as well as increased costs as it meets tougher European Union emissions regulations and the costly switch to electric vehicles. Audi saw falling sales, revenues and operating profits in the first nine months of 2019.In a statement, the carmaker said the job cuts would ""take place along the demographic curve - in particular through employee turnover and a new, attractive early retirement programme"".""The company must become lean and fit for the future, which means that some job profiles will no longer be needed and new ones will be created.""The carmaker said it would guarantee the jobs of operational workers until 2029.It added that it would continue to train young people and maintain its number of apprentices and student trainees over the next three years. Speaking about the extension of the job guarantee for the workforce, spokesman Peter Mosch said: ""We have reached an important milestone.""The jobs of our core workforce are secure. The extension of the employment guarantee is a great success in difficult times. In addition, the upcoming electrification of the Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm plants. underscores the long-term success of both German sites.""Like its rivals, Audi is spending billions of euros on new technologies, including battery-electric and hybrid vehicles, connectivity and autonomous driving. But the firm last year also had to pay an €800m fine over its role in the ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal scandal that started at parent company VW.It is not just German carmakers that are facing sluggish growth. Car parts suppliers Bosch and Continental have announced thousands of job cuts. And it comes against the wider backdrop of a slowing German economy, which has narrowly avoided a recession.Audi has sailed through some stormy seas over the past few years, but now it's setting its sights on a new horizon.The upmarket VW Group brand was at the heart of the diesel emissions cheating scandal, which erupted in 2015. Its former chief executive, Rupert Stadler, has been charged with fraud over his alleged role in the affair.Now, like its parent, Audi is focusing on the future - and working flat out to develop electric cars.It has already launched the E-tron, the first of 20 battery-powered models due to appear by 2025. But developing electric cars that people actually want to drive costs money.No surprise then that Audi is trying to streamline its operations and slim down its workforce.Competition in the electric car market is heating up rapidly. Within the next few years we could even see a battle for survival among the traditional mainstream carmakers, as they adapt to what will soon become a very different environment.Being lean could be a big advantage."
business	Gig economy: 'It was the only way we could afford a house'	'We were stuck'Changing world of work	"Daniel Lewis, 33, was struggling to save up to buy a house, despite saving for years from his full-time 37-hour-a-week job.To increase his earnings, he started doing an additional 14 hours a week of part-time, or gig economy, work.The number of people doing gig economy work has doubled in the past three years, the TUC trades union body says.Young people are most likely to be doing this type of flexible, insecure work.The TUC says the majority of people using apps such as Uber or Handy to find work have other jobs.This shows that ""working people are battling to making ends meet"", said TUC chief Frances O'Grady.Mr Lewis and his partner Zoe, based in Leeds, had a target of saving up £9,000 for a house deposit.However, they still didn't have enough money after saving money from their monthly wages into an ISA and using the government's help-to-buy scheme.In 20 months, Mr Lewis managed to earn £4,500 extra after tax to help them reach their goal, by working an additional 3.5 hours a day, four times a week, as a driver for Amazon and Uber Eats.""We were stuck in the rental market for years - you tend to find you don't have anything left at the end of it, especially those who come out of university,"" he told the BBC.""It was literally the only way we could get onto the property ladder, given the amount of money you have to save these days.""Even though they now have a house, Mr Lewis continues to do gig economy work in order to help with additional expenses, such as doing up their garden.""I've continued to do it because you just get used to having the money I suppose,"" he added.He was attracted to work for Amazon and Uber Eats because both services pay their drivers once a week and offer instant, flexible working.These benefits outweighed the fact that he had to pay for his own petrol and do his own taxes, because gig economy workers are classed as being self-employed.One in 10 working age adults now find gig economy work through apps or websites, the TUC said, compared with about one in 20 in 2016.The data comes from a survey of 2,235 UK residents carried out by the University of Hertfordshire and Ipsos Mori.The survey of 2,235 UK residents found that nearly two-thirds of workers using apps to find work at least once a week were aged between 16 and 34.Ms O'Grady said: ""Huge numbers are being forced to take on casual and insecure platform work - often on top of other jobs.""But as we've seen with Uber, too often these workers are denied their rights and are treated like disposable labour.""Ursula Huws, professor of labour and globalisation at the University of Hertfordshire, said the work being sought was not just taxi driving and food delivery.""They're only a small proportion of gig workers. They're outnumbered by an invisible army of people working remotely on their computers or smartphones or providing services in other people's homes,"" she said.Six in 10 of the respondents to the survey admitted buying services in this way at some point.The TUC said the survey showed that it was time for all workers to get basic rights such as the minimum wage and holiday.""The world of work is changing fast and working people don't have the protection they need,"" Ms O'Grady said.At the end of last year, the government said it was introducing measures to give better protection to workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or gig economy workers.Staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave, and given the right to require more predictable hours.In February 2018, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published research showing that 4.4% of the population in Great Britain had worked in the gig economy in the last 12 months."
business	US economy grows faster than expected	Analysis:Fed faces 'tricky summer'	"The US economy grew much faster than expected in the first quarter of the year, helped by a jump in exports and by firms building up stocks of goods.The economy expanded at an annualised pace of 3.2% in the January-to-March period, well above analysts' forecasts.The economy has accelerated since the previous quarter, when it grew at a pace of 2.2%.However, some analysts warned growth had been boosted by one-off factors, and could slow in the months ahead.The growth figures - which are subject to revision in the months ahead - appeared to dispel any fears of an economic slowdown.Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross welcomed the data, saying: ""The Trump economy has repeatedly defied the sceptics who predicted an economic downturn and has restored America's position in the world as a consistent source of economic growth.""Trade helped to boost growth in the first quarter, as exports rose while imports fell. Companies also built up inventories of goods at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2015.However, consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of economic activity in the US, grew by only 1.2% in the first quarter, down from a rate of 2.5% previously.By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondentThe growth figure was quite a surprise and it certainly defuses some of the warnings about a possible recession in the US.There were, however, some features of the figures that suggest the headline growth rate is a little flattering. The acceleration owed something to companies building up their stocks of goods. That is a process that won't go on indefinitely, not at the same rate.There was also a contribution from government spending and from international trade. The last of these is striking, in the context of the increase in global trade tensions due to a significant extent to the more assertive policies pursued by the Trump administration. Will that be sustained?Consumer spending is a traditional source of US economic strength. It did grow in this period, but more slowly than before. Spending on goods actually declined, although that was more than offset by services.All that said, some observers point out that the first estimate for this quarter tends to be revised upwards. So we could yet end up with an even stronger figure.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump called on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, claiming that the Fed had ""really slowed us down"" in terms of economic growth.In March, the Fed had indicated that it did not plan to raise interest rates - which currently stand between 2.25% and 2.5% - for the rest of 2019.Ian Shepherson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ""strong"" GDP report meant the Fed could have a ""tricky summer"".""The problem for the Fed now... is that if growth continues at anything like this pace, the labour market will tighten much further this year, and the question of rate hikes will be back on the agenda"".However, Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, warned that there were ""plenty of causes for concern"" behind the headline growth figure.As well as the boost from trade and inventories, he noted growth was also lifted by government spending on highways and roads.""So taking out the over-sized boosts from net trade, inventories and highways investment, which will all be reversed in the coming quarters, growth was only around 1.0%,"" Mr Ashworth says.""Under those circumstances, we continue to expect that overall growth will slow this year, forcing the Fed to begin cutting interest rates before year-end."""
business	Brazil economy contracts for the first time since 2016	Analysis: By Daniel Gallas, South America Business CorrespondentRising risk	"Brazil's economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2016, when the country was in recession.It contracted by 0.2% compared with the last three months of 2018. Compared with a year ago, it grew by 0.5%.The fall comes at time when Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, is facing scrutiny of his efforts to revive the economy after a two-year recession.Economists said there was a risk of another recession.If the economy shrinks again in the second quarter, the country, once regarded as having huge growth potential, will be in recession again.That would come barely three years after the two-year recession in 2015 and 2016, when the economy shrank by almost 7%.William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that while the contraction in the economy was, in part, the result of temporary factors, there were early signs that growth in the second quarter had also been weak.""There is now a real risk that the economy will slip into a technical recession,"" Mr Jackson said.The county was once designated as one of the Brics - which along with Russia, India, China and South Africa could outpace developed economies by 2050.While the contraction was in line with expectations, it is an early indication of economic performance since Mr Bolsonaro took power in January and appointed businessman Paulo Guedes as ""super-minister"" of the economy.When Jair Bolsonaro was elected, Brazil's stock market and currency both bounced up - showing just how confident markets were in the new government.Mr Bolsonaro had given carte blanche to his economy minister, businessman Paulo Guedes, to act on reforms.Almost five months later, there is much disappointment with the government and with the economy.Mr Guedes has been the target of friendly fire: attacks from other ministers, resistance in Congress from Mr Bolsonaro's own party and even calls for state intervention coming from the president himself.He has also repeatedly threatened to leave the government if he doesn't get his way with Congress.Markets now believe Brazil will only start to show any significant growth next year.In the first three months of the year, there was a drop in investment and a decline in industrial and agricultural output.There was also a 1.9% slump in exports which was, Mr Jackson said, in part, related to lower metals exports.""This appears to be due to cuts in iron ore output following the Brumadinho dam tragedy,"" he said.Brazil's worst mining disaster was caused when the embankment tailings dam in Brumadinho broke, leaving hundreds dead.It is owned by Vale, the world's biggest producer of iron ore.Mr Jackson expects the cut in iron ore production to have only a one-off impact on Brazil's economy and expects growth in the second quarter.Even so, he said there was ""growing risk"" of another contraction because of weakening sentiment in April and May.Isabela Guarino, chief economist at XP Asset Management in Sao Paulo, also expects growth in the second quarter, but said: ""There is a very real risk of contraction, which would take the country into a technical recession.""It's not our base case, but it's a rising risk."""
business	Germany's economy: Should we be worried?	How bad is the German economic situation?What about the rest of the eurozone?Why are Germany and the eurozone struggling?Can the European Central Bank do anything?What about governments?	"It has been a poor week for German economic news.On Friday, we learned that industrial production in February - excluding energy and construction - had fallen.The previous day, new official data showed that manufacturing orders also declined in the same month.At the start of the week, another survey of the same sector reported new orders and export sales ""falling at rates not seen since the global financial crisis"".We look at what's gone wrong for the German industrial machine.There's no question that the German economy has hit a difficult patch. The widest measure of economic activity, gross domestic product (GDP), declined in the third quarter of last year by 0.2% and failed to grow in the following three months.In terms of recession, as widely defined (two consecutive quarters of contraction), that is a very near miss indeed.That said, the jobs market in Germany is still in pretty decent health. The unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world at 3.1%.Among the rich countries, only the Czech Republic, Iceland and Japan have lower figures. Germany's unemployment rate has continued to decline during this period of weak GDP performance.Another way of looking at it is the employment rate - the percentage of the working age population who do have jobs (or self-employment). That continued to grow in the last two quarters of 2018; by 0.2% in each period.It's also worth noting that other business surveys this week have been much more upbeat, pointing to continued expansion in services and construction.But manufacturing is going through a more difficult spell.Growth in the the eurozone as a whole has slowed.In part, that reflects Germany's situation. It accounts for 29% of eurozone economic activity, so weakness in Germany drags down the average even if nothing changes anywhere else.Some eurozone countries don't seem to have lost momentum to any great extent so far. Among the large economies Spain is the obvious example.But others have had a setback, notably Italy, which is in recession.The country has a persistent problem with weak growth. Growth has never been strong and went into reverse last year. In fact, the Italian economy is still smaller than it was before the financial crisis a decade ago.Eurozone unemployment varies widely. It is down from the highest levels it reached during the eurozone crisis, very sharply in some cases.But at 7.8%, it is still fairly high. Unemployment is still in double figures in three countries: Italy, Spain and Greece, where the figure is 18%.The recovery after the eurozone financial crisis was never that strong.But in the last year or so, the region has been hit by adverse trade winds. It matters particularly to Germany, which is Europe's leading goods exporter and number three globally (after China and the US).There are several factors. China's economic slowdown has weakened demand for foreign goods and it's an important market for Germany.President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium are also an issue. Looking ahead the possibility that he might impose tariffs on cars could do a lot more damage to Germany.The uncertainty associated with Brexit is also a factor mentioned by German firms in their survey responses.There have also been some temporary factors that have contributed to Germany's problems.New emissions testing procedures set back car production last year and low water levels on the Rhine restricted cargo traffic for a time. The river is a very important transport route for German industry.Using economic policy to tackle this slowdown is challenging. The options available to policymakers are seriously constrained.The European Central Bank (ECB) already has interest rates at or close to the lowest level they can be. Its main rate is zero and one - the deposit rate for money held overnight for commercial banks - is even lower; it's negative.The ECB halted its ""quantitative easing"" policy of buying financial assets with newly created money at the end of last year.Reviving them is certainly possible, but there are complications.For some types of asset the ECB is approaching the maximum amount it wants to hold - to avoid distorting the market too much.And politically it would be difficult especially in Germany where the programme was always viewed with unease.""Printing money"" as the programme is sometimes called can conjure up fears of high inflation and Germany has had seriously disruptive episodes of that in the first half of the twentieth century.Another option to stimulate economic activity in a slowdown is the government finances: tax cuts or spending increases.Many economists would argue that Germany has the scope to do that.The government currently spends less than it collects in taxes. But it is reluctant to use its finances as a stimulus.There are legal restrictions in German law and the whole thrust of eurozone policy on government finances has been affected by the experience of the government debt crisis earlier in the decade.Even if Germany does have some room in principle to use its finances to stimulate the economy, others have less.The most recent assessment by the European Commission concluded that there was still a need for ""prudent"" policies to ensure the sustainability of government finances.Some, critics, however think that the EU's rules for eurozone government finances are too restrictive."
business	Germany narrowly avoids recession despite trade war hit	Manufacturing challengesCar industry struggling	Germany has narrowly avoided a recession, according to new official data.The country's economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year after contracting in the previous three months.A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity.Germany's strength as an exporter of manufactured goods has left it exposed to recent conflict in global trade.The growth figure was the right side of zero but it is still very weak. Putting together the new figures and the previous quarter's performance, the economy did shrink slightly over the six month period.Trade is a central element in this story.The value of total German exports - including services - is about 47% of the country's whole economy, its gross domestic product or GDP.There is a lot of imported content in those exports. So an alternative way of looking at it is the value added in Germany of the goods it sells abroad. That is about a third of GDP.For such a big economy, those figures are very large.They reflect the strength of the country's manufacturing industry. Manufactured goods are more extensively traded than services.The figures mean Germany has been very vulnerable to adverse winds in global commerce.The tensions that have followed the more assertive approach of US President Donald Trump's administration are a case in point.Germany has been affected through several channels.The conflict between the US and China has affected the Chinese economy which is an important buyer of German vehicles and industrial equipment.There have been US tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium.And more recently US tariffs in retaliation over subsidies to the European aircraft maker Airbus have targeted the four individual countries responsible for most of the financial support - Germany, along with the UK, France and Spain.No surprise then that German economic growth has been slower this year.The newest figures show that exports did increase in the third quarter of the 2019. But sales abroad have been hit and the risks to exporters remain significant.It is not all down to trade.Germany's motor industry has had a hard time with emissions issues. Volkswagen was the central player in the scandal over emissions test cheating.And now there are further issues with the need to adapt to new European Union rules on greenhouse gas emissions and the related challenge of making the transition to electric powered vehicles, which requires massive investment.There is also a widely held view in Germany that the country needs a major investment programme to improve its infrastructure, in areas such as rail, bridges and broadband.All that said it bears emphasising that Germany has one of the lowest unemployment rates on the planet at 3.1%. It has also seen the number of people with jobs continue to grow this year, although more slowly than in the recent past.It is also the case that in terms of the recovery from the financial crisis Germany is a relatively strong performer.Among the G7 group of leading developed economies, Germany comes out best compared with pre-crisis levels in terms of GDP per capita, a somewhat rough and ready indicator of average living standards.
business	Labour's John McDonnell says UK economy requires 'revolution'	'Something big'	"Labour is planning a ""revolution"" for the UK economy, John McDonnell has told the BBC.The shadow chancellor was speaking to Newsnight for a series of reports to mark 40 years since the election of Margaret Thatcher.He said he saw parallels between today and 1979 when Mrs Thatcher swept to power in a major political sea-change.""Things aren't working for people, so they're looking for change,"" Mr McDonnell said.Asked whether Labour's plans represented evolution or revolution he said: ""OK it will be a revolution. Transformative - because we are going to change society and that's what's demanded of us now.""He added: ""And do you know? I think most people accept that now. We'll do it by taking people with us. But it will be done on a very pragmatic basis.""It is common sense socialism and the point about that first period of office when we go into government will be to lay the foundations for this transformation that we want.""So we are in a hurry - because the issues are so desperate now.""Labour is advocating higher taxes on the wealthy and companies, a major expansion of public investment, the re-nationalisation of certain utilities and moves to give many more workers a direct financial ownership stake in their firms.Critics and advocates alike say this would represent a major break from the Thatcherite legacy of lower taxes, free markets, deregulation and privatisation.Speaking in the same Newsnight film on the future of the UK's economic settlement, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, agreed the UK was on the verge of a major change.""I do think there is something happening, something big. Politics is now debating ideas again from first principles. We went through a few years - the Blair years, the Cameron years - where it was all about managerial politics... now we are having a more fundamental debate about our economy.""But she rejected Labour's policy agenda, particularly on tax and a bigger role for the state.""I think higher taxes just choke economic growth,"" she said.""Money that is taken in taxes is money that can't be invested in the wider economy. I look at countries like Japan and Korea which run very successful economies and the size of the state is lower.""There's no reason we can't be more successful. Our challenge as a government is to raise economic growth.

business	Turkey's economy slides into recession	Worst over?	"Turkey went into recession at the end of last year, according to the country's official statistics office.The Turkish Statistical Institute said the economy shrank by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018, from the previous quarter.It followed a 1.6% drop the previous quarter, making two quarters of falling growth - the definition of recession.A trade war with the US sparked a steep fall in Turkey's currency, making imports far more expensive.The two countries are opposed on a range of issues including how to fight the Islamic State group in Turkey's neighbour Syria, Turkey's plans to buy Russian missile defence systems and how to punish the alleged plotters of a failed coup in Turkey in 2016 which attempted to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Turkey also wants the extradition of a Turkish cleric now living in the US who it has charged with terrorism and espionage.Turkey's lira fell by 30% against the dollar last year, making imports on average a third more expensive.That prompted the central bank to raise interest rates, making borrowing more expensive.Car and housing sales suffered as a result and industrial production was also hit.The final quarter's data leaves economic growth of 2.6% overall for 2018, the slowest since 2009, and a marked reverse from 2017's growth rate of 7.4%.The news comes as President Erdogan, fights to keep his party in control of key cities Ankara and Istanbul in nationwide local elections.Rising prices, especially for food, and high unemployment, are major election issues.Turkey's finance minister, Berat Albayrak, said the worst was over and he expects the economy to return to growth by the end of this year.But analysts at Capital Economics expect the economy to perform poorly this year.""While the worst of the downturn may now have passed, the weak carryover means that we expect GDP to decline by 2.5% this year,"" the firm said in a research note.It adds, though, that is it more gloomy than other commentators."
business	UK economy ‘stalls’ over Brexit and global economy fears	'Political uncertainty'Analysis:	"The UK's service sector stagnated last month, with new orders falling for the first time in two-and-a-half years, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI).The figures showed a reading of 50.1 in January, lower than December's 51.2.IHS Markit's Chris Williamson said the results indicated that the UK economy ""is at risk of stalling or worse"".He said this was because of growing Brexit uncertainty coinciding with a wider slowdown in the global economy.Economists had expected a reading of 51 - a figure above 50 indicates growth.It follows last Friday's news that the PMI figures for manufacturing fell to 52.8 last month - the second weakest reading since July 2016.The figures revealed that UK manufacturers were preparing for Brexit by stockpiling raw materials at a record pace and that there was a risk of the sector slipping into recession.Speaking about the service sector figures, Mr Williamson said: ""Growth ground almost to a halt in January, matching similar disappointing news in the manufacturing and construction sectors.""The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter.""The survey results indicate that companies are becoming increasingly risk averse and eager to reduce overheads in the face of weakened customer demand and rising political uncertainty.""Such worries were in turn most commonly linked to heightened Brexit anxiety, though wider global political and economic factors were also seen to have been taking their toll on demand.""Andy Verity, economics correspondentUntil very recently, what's been most remarkable is not how much of an economic impact all the Brexit-related uncertainty has had, but how little. Growth has continued. The number employed keeps hitting new records. The services sector which makes up four-fifths of our economy has continued to expand.But, crucially, those upbeat figures on jobs and growth are lagging indicators, about two months behind reality. The purchasing managers' index is more up to date, surveying the people in firms taking financial decisions.According to them the most forward-looking indicators - such as new orders from customers - are down.However - before we assume the politics of Brexit is stalling the economy, it's worth noting something. Back in July 2016, right after the referendum, respondents to the survey were even gloomier than they are now.Some economists predicted capital flight; others predicted recession. Those fears, so far at least, have proved largely misplaced.Mr Williamson's views on uncertainty over the impact of Brexit were backed up by other experts.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Services firms could not be clearer in blaming Brexit uncertainty for the stagnation of activity in January.""He added that the figures suggested that activity could fall over the coming months, but said that similar forecasts in 1998, 2001 and 2003 ""failed to materialise"".And Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: ""Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the heart of the malaise, as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity."""
business	World economy facing delicate moment, IMF says	'Precarious' recoveryFlare of disruption?	"The global economy is at what the International Monetary Fund's chief economist calls a ""delicate moment"".Gita Gopinath says that while she does not predict a global recession, ""there are are many downside risks"".The IMF has released its regular assessment of the World Economic Outlook, which forecasts global growth of 3.3% this year and 3.6% in 2020.That would be slower growth than last year - and for 2019, a downgrade compared with the previous forecast.The downward revision of 0.2 percentage points for global growth is spread widely.Developed economies affected include the US, the UK and the eurozone.The UK economy is predicted to grow by 1.2% in 2019, down 0.3% from the IMF forecast in January. Growth in 2020 has also been revised down.The revisions are especially marked for Germany and Italy, which is already in recession.The IMF expects weaker performance in Latin America, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.For China, there are small revisions, upward for this year and downward for next. The slowdown there, which began at the start of the decade, is expected to continue.The weakness in the forecast reflects a slowdown in the latter part of 2018, which the IMF expects to continue in the first half of this year.After that, growth should pick up more pace, with the additional momentum continuing into next year.But Ms Gopinath describes that recovery as ""precarious"".She says it depends on a recovery in a number of developing economies that are stressed, notably Turkey and Argentina.Ms Gopinath also expects a partial recovery in the eurozone.The US, however, is likely to slow further, growing by slightly less than 2% next year as the impact of President Donald Trump's tax cuts fades.There is no sign in her blog, or in the IMF's report, of any sympathy for President Trump's view that the main thing holding back the US economy is the Federal Reserve's increases in interest rates over the last two years.The risks that Ms Gopinath warns about include some familiar ones.The first she mentions is the possibility that global trade tensions could flare up again and spread into new areas.She refers to cars in particular, an area where President Trump is considering new tariffs on imported goods.That, she suggests, could lead to ""large disruptions to global supply chains"". She says the escalation of US-China trade tensions contributed to last year's slowdown.She also mentions risks associated with Brexit. The forecasts for the UK are based on the expectation of an orderly departure - with a deal - from the EU later this year. A no-deal Brexit would be more costly.Other risks include the possibility of a deterioration in financial markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, including for governments. That raises the possibility of what she calls sovereign/bank doom loops.That was a particular problem in the euro-area financial crisis, when financial problems for governments and banks reinforced one another."
business	Beauty industry bullying: 'I saw strong women cry at their desks'	'No future''It's heartbreaking'	"The British Beauty Council is calling for an independent body to be set up to investigate claims of bullying and unfair dismissal in the industry, which does not have a trade union. It comes after the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme uncovered cases of bullying across all levels of the industry.""I was seeing grown women, strong women, crying at their desks. It was so toxic and harsh that people were just desperate to leave,"" says Sarah (not her real name), who had a senior role working for an international beauty brand.She says her boss was a bully who spoke behind her back and told suppliers she was sharing their confidential information.""After that, the bosses only gave me junior roles within projects and I was taken off the project I had been working on very successfully for two years,"" she says.""I was ignored by HR [human resources] and the board of directors. I feel so much anger - but it's not even anger, it's heartbreak.""Sarah has since left the company.The beauty industry contributed £14.2bn to the UK economy last year and employs one in every 60 people.The Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to more than 20 people, from a company director to make-up artists in department stores, who claim to be victims of bullying, abuse and bad practice.Many said they had suffered from anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts as a result.Nearly all said the industry was facing an institutional bullying crisis but feared if they complained they would never work in it again.It has no union, so employees can find they have no-one to put their case to or seek advice from outside their company.Many of those the Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to had signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which are usually part of a deal where the employees are offered thousands of pounds for their silence.But both Sarah and another woman said that despite signing, they still wanted their stories to be heard but with their identities disguised.""Nicole"", who worked as an executive for a well-known beauty company, says she was pushed out after telling her bosses she was pregnant.'I was left out of meetings, I wasn't given information, they stopped cc'ing me in emails,"" she says. ""Then, within 10 weeks of me coming back from maternity leave, I was told I didn't have a future in the company and that I should just leave.""I basically believed everything they told me, I believed I was a bad person. I was diagnosed with depression, with stress and burnout. I spent time in a facility. I'm really lucky I recovered… but so many people don't.""It is not just women who are affected. Zak, who is now a freelance make-up artist, says he has been treated badly in the past.""There were a lot of times when they were like, 'Are you sure you want him to do your make-up? He's a guy, he doesn't know how to do make-up,'"" he says. ""People are greedy in that sense and they want everything to themselves and they don't care who they throw under the bus.""I went through a bit of a depression phase, I felt everyone around me was fake.""Employment lawyer Karen Jackson says she has dealt with hundreds of discrimination cases, including bullying and harassment in the cosmetics industry.""I've dealt with similar claims against the same companies who don't seem to learn from past mistakes and who tolerate unacceptable workplace conduct,"" she says. ""I don't understand why they won't address it and weed it out making life better for everyone.""But there are people in the industry trying to make a change.Celebrity make-up artist Lan Nguyen-Grealis says she was a victim of bullying and harassment earlier in her career and uses the experience to be even kinder.""It's all about sisterhood - a lot of the girls have freedom to come and speak to me offside whenever they need to, or if they need to let off steam it's fine,"" she says. ""It's important the girls know this industry is amazing, but if you're a really nice person, you will sustain a great career. ""The British Beauty Council represents the voices, opinions and needs of the industry.After being shown the programme's findings, chief executive Millie Kendall said: ""It's heartbreaking an industry that we are trying to pull together is so at each other's throats.""It does fall on the government because this isn't just a beauty industry-related issue, this is a nationwide issue.

business	UK economy stalls despite strong January	The key numbersWhat do the figures tell us?So are firms stockpiling?What does it all mean?Analysis by economics correspondent Dharshini David	"The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to January, matching the growth of the previous three months.The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a pick-up in activity in January when the economy expanded by 0.5%.The ONS said strength in IT, health services and wholesale trading offset falls in the manufacturing of metals and cars, and construction repair work.The increase in wholesale could indicate stockpiling ahead of Brexit.The total output of goods and services in the UK, or gross domestic product (GDP), grew by 0.2% in the three months to the end of January.The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.5% on a rolling three-month basis, mainly driven by wholesale and retail trade.Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said growth across the latest three months had ""remained weak"" with falls in the output of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening economic growth. However, he added that was offset by strong performances in wholesale, IT and health services.In January the economy staged a bit of a comeback, growing by 0.5%The services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the private sector economy, grew by 0.3% in January after a 0.2% fall in December.Construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, reversed December's fall to grow by 2.8% in January.Production and manufacturing output also both grew in January, having contracted in December.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the data confirmed growth momentum in the UK economy had ""stalled"".""The first glimpse of GDP data for this year points to a UK economy hovering well below its growth potential, as we wait for the Brexit fog to dissipate.Ms Selfin said she expected growth to ""remain subdued in the short-term"".However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said the numbers provided some reassurance that the UK economy is weathering a political crisis at home and a slowdown overseas ""pretty well"".""Of course, the data may deteriorate in February and March if Brexit has caused consumers and firms to reach for the handbrake,"" he added.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""The service sector remains the main driver of UK growth on this rolling three-month measure, with industrial production and construction contracting. Despite a boost in January, the manufacturing sector remains an area of concern with significant cost pressures and moderating demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector.""The lack of clarity on crucial aspects of how companies will operate after 29 March, as well as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, has led many firms having to take drastic action to safeguard their operations, which has resulted in unnecessary costs, diversion of resources and loss of business, subduing overall economic activity.It seems it depends on your point of view.Some experts think the increase in wholesale activity does signal that some businesses are building up stocks ahead of Brexit.KPMG's Ms Selfin said there was ""evidence that stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit has bolstered growth in some industries"".However, at Capital Economics Andrew Wishart said there was ""little evidence"" of stockbuilding, with output in the transport and storage sector falling in January and the three-month growth in imports easing off.The ONS was unable to comment on whether the growth was linked to UK manufacturers stockpiling.The uncomfortable truth is that the economy has lost speed. Growth of 0.2% across three months is a fraction of what the UK typically achieves.Brexit uncertainty appears to have hammered business investment, while growth in the Eurozone has fallen way short of expectations.Although the economy expanded by 0.5% in January alone, even the number crunchers who calculate these monthly estimates admit that they're volatile and need cautious treatment.And January's rebound was driven by manufacturing and construction.But surveys suggest recent industrial activity has been driven by speeding up production of finished goods ahead of Brexit rather than new orders; though the ONS numbers don't distinguish between these.And the rebound follows very weak months for manufacturing and construction - output across the last three months in both was flat.Total growth across the last three months was driven by services - in particular the wholesale retailing, again hinting at stockbuilding.The ""fog of Brexit"" may have actually inflated activity of late. Beyond that, growth is at best sluggish."
business	What's going on with the UK economy?	What should we make of the 'jobs miracle'?Why is economic growth lukewarm?How near are we to hitting the inflation target?Could an interest rate rise be on the way?So, overall, where are we?	"More than 1,000 days since the referendum, and with the clock ticking down to 29 March, the path of Brexit remains unclear.Ahead of the 2016 vote, the Treasury warned that leaving could damage the economy.And yet, for all the political turmoil and uncertainty, the economy continues to trundle along - and appears to be doing very well on some fronts.Almost 30 years ago, US economist David Shulman introduced the phrase ""Goldilocks economy"" to describe one that's neither blowing too hot nor cold but expanding at just the right pace, with good jobs growth.Does that apply to the UK?And were those warnings from the Treasury merely ""Project Fear"": fairy tales in themselves?Time to check the temperature of the UK economy.Employment is at record highs, unemployment at its lowest for almost 45 years.Wages are growing at their fastest rate for a decade, with pay rises typically outpacing the cost of living.If the jobs market was a bowl of fairy tale porridge, it might be Daddy Bear's blisteringly hot serving, steaming away with few signs of damage from the Brexit ""fog"".But hiring tends to lag behind changes in activity by between six and nine months on average, while firms determine whether changes in circumstances are permanent, and then recruitment (or redundancy) takes time.After the financial crisis, firms opted to hang on to workers as they were relatively cheap compared with investing; the same could be happening again as they grapple with uncertainty.And while real wages are rising, they have only resumed that growth in recent months; the average post-inflation wage is still £7 a week lower than it was a decade ago.The economy expanded by 0.2% in the latest three months - and by 1.4% across 2018; steady but lacklustre.GDP growth is the Mummy Bear porridge bowl - disappointingly lukewarm.As the Bank of England noted, expansion has been held back by a lack of business investment since the referendum - and also by a slowdown in our major trading partners, particularly China and the EU.As the chancellor has said, the UK is in ""the middle of the G7 pack"" growth-wise.But it could have been better - various estimates suggest that the economy is up to 2% smaller post-referendum than it previously expected.And even with a deal, the Treasury, the Bank of England and the City are broadly agreed that the UK could be on track for the weakest growth this year in a decade.With prices rising by 1.9% in the year to February - within a whisker of the official target of 2% - inflation appears to be the Baby Bear bowl of the bunch: just right.Prices are rising sufficiently to signify there's life in the economy but not so fast to be punitive or destabilising.But that doesn't mean inflation can be ignored, which brings us to…For over a decade, the base rates set by the Bank of England have been below 1%; great news for borrowers, less so for savers.The Bank sets those rates to keep inflation close to its target in two years' time - that's how long it estimates it takes for interest rates to influence prices (largely via the spending and borrowing habits of households and businesses).If the trend of faster real wage growth continues and a Brexit deal is swiftly agreed, with little disruption to the economy, some economists think there could be a small rate rise later this year.That's quite a few ifs.With prolonged uncertainty, or a disruptive exit, some argue that the next move in interest rates may be down rather than up.For now, the economy's in a decent state. But not all fairy tales have happy endings.The last time the US economy was widely deemed to be in a Goldilocks state, the financial crisis swiftly followed.With much of the global economy slowing again, and the risk of a disruptive Brexit lingering, the UK economy could be in for a few twists and turns."
business	German economy narrowly avoids recession	'Worrying' outlookAnalysis:	"Germany's economy just about avoided falling into recession during the final three months of last year.Europe's largest economy registered zero growth during the fourth quarter of 2018, the country's Federal Statistics Office said.That means it avoided two consecutive quarters of contraction, which is the usual definition of a recession.A weak trade performance dragged on the economy, and consumer spending remained subdued.The zero growth recorded in the October-to-December period followed a 0.2% contraction in the previous quarter.Reasons for slower growth last year include a slowdown in the global economy and a weaker car sector, with German consumers less willing to buy new cars amid confusion over new emission standards.In addition, low water levels, particularly in the Rhine, affected growth by holding back movement of some goods.Jack Allen, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC: ""If you look at Germany across 2018 we've seen a pretty broad-based slowdown in growth. We've seen household consumption slow, we've seen business investment slow and we've seen export growth slow.He added: ""What's particularly worrying is that the early signs for 2019 suggest that a strong rebound is unlikely.""US tariffs on EU car exports, which US President Donald Trump has threatened, could have a major impact on Germany, Mr Allen said, but even if these are avoided the slowdown in the global economy means Germany is still only expected to grow by about 1% this year, compared with about 1.5% in 2018.However, Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he was ""optimistic"" that the first quarter of this year would be better.""The January [economic] surveys were poor... but net exports won't be in free fall forever, and consumers' spending also ought to pick up.""By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondentIt couldn't have been much closer. And it is certainly possible that subsequent revisions to these figures will take the fourth quarter figure below zero and Germany into recession as the term is often defined.For now though it looks like a very soft patch that has affected much of Europe.Italy had a recession at the end of last year. The eurozone as whole has managed to continue to grow in spite of the weakening performance of two its largest economies. But it has been markedly slower.That said, the jobs situation specifically in Germany is pretty good. Unemployment is among the lowest in the world at just above 3%."
business	China economy: First quarter growth beats expectations at 6.4%		"China's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the three months to March, official figures released Wednesday showed.The economy expanded at 6.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, ahead of a Reuters forecast of 6.3%.Beijing has taken steps to boost its slowing economy, including tax cuts, while trying not to inflate debt.The world's second-largest economy also faces softer global demand for its products and a trade war with the US.China's rate of growth is closely-watched for the potential knock-on effect on the global economy.The latest growth figures were in line with the 6.4% rate posted in the last three months of 2018.The result follow a sharp pick-up in factory output, with industrial production jumping to 8.5% in March.Other data out Wednesday also showed improvement. Retail sales for March rose 8.7% on a year earlier, and fixed asset investment expanded to 6.3% from a year earlier.While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory.""There is no denying that China's economy ended the first quarter on a stronger note,"" Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said.Beijing is forecasting slower growth of between 6% and 6.5% this year, down from a target of around 6.5% in 2018.China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption.Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy including cutting some taxes, speeding up construction projects and cutting the level of reserves banks are required to hold.Mr Evans-Pritchard said there are still ""some reasons for caution"" in the short-term.""But with credit growth now accelerating and sentiment improving, China's economy will bottom out before long if it hasn't already."""
business	Ethiopia relaxes visa rules to boost economy	Boosting the economy	"In November, Ethiopia finally opened up its borders by relaxing visa requirements.Previously, the country ranked 50 out of all 54 African nations for visa openness, according to the African Development Bank.All African nationals now receive visas on arrival, as part of efforts to make free movement within Africa possible.For many Africans, multiple visas are still required for intercontinental travel.It's only been a few months, but the new visa scheme has brought smiles to many travellers.Cameroonian traveller Elvis Achunzi told the BBC that previously his firm would have to spend a lot of time to ensure employees could get their visas before travelling to Ethiopia.""We had to struggle with our partners here in Ethiopia to get a pre-arrangement with the immigration,"" he said.The Ethiopian government is hoping that simplifying visas will have long term benefits, such as boosting its economy.""This social bond of interaction of Ethiopians with the rest of Africa systems could be more facilitated, and the flow of business and investment and of course tourism could be easily felt here in Ethiopia,"" said Sileshi Demisew, a spokesman for Ethiopia's immigration department.But the problem is that not all African nations are playing ball.Some countries are still dragging their feet when it comes to border access, and analysts feel decisions need to be taken as a bloc, rather than by individual nations.The African Union (AU) set out a roadmap for the continent that was adopted by all members states in 2013.As part of that plan, all African nations were supposed to scrap visa requirements for all African citizens by 2018.However, a recent AU report found that Africans can travel without a visa to just 22% of other African countries.""I don't think we should need visas to travel around Africa as we are one continent and we should be like a united nation all across Africa,"" South African traveller Precious told the BBC."
business	UK economy grows faster than expected ahead of Brexit	Impact of stockpilingRate rises	"Stockpiling by manufacturers ahead of Brexit helped the UK economy grow by 0.3% in the three months to February.The Office for National Statistics pointed to manufacturers ""changing the timing of their activities"" as the UK's exit from the EU approaches.Although growth was stronger than the 0.2% many economists forecast, Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said growth ""remained modest"".On a monthly measure, the economy grew by 0.2%, faster than the 0% forecast.The 0.3% rise in the three months to February, was the same as the three months to January, after previous estimate was revised higher.""Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT. Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months,"" said Mr Kent-Smith.Output in production and manufacturing rose for the second month in a row, with manufacturing at its highest level since April 2008, the ONS said.The ONS said production industries expanded by 0.2% in the three months to February 2019. This was the first positive three-month growth since October 2018.It said there had been external evidence ""that some manufacturing businesses have changed the timing of their activity as we approached the original planned date for the UK's departure from the European Union"".""Although the ONS does not routinely collect detailed data on the reasons behind the behaviour of businesses, as part of our survey validation we have found some qualitative evidence that supported this view but were unable to quantify its impact,"" it added.The ONS pointed to a closely-watched survey by IHS Markit/CIPS which showed UK factories were stockpiling goods for Brexit.Lola's Cupcakes is one company which decided it needed to build up stocks of essential items ahead of Brexit.In its case, it was cream cheese.Asher Budwig, managing director, said the company had identified the ingredient as one at risk from Brexit. Others might have been chocolate or butter.There would be ""no cheese cakes, no decorations on cupcakes"" if ferries stopped getting through ports, he told BBC.The company bought £35,000 of stock - that does not include storage costs - through its supplier which obtains the product from Germany.""They [the supplier] spoke to the factory in Germany, they produced a lot more, ten times what we would normally go through in a given week,"" he said.""It's being held down in Somerset,"" he said.Month-on-month growth in the industrial production sector was 0.6% in February, with manufacturing increasing 0.9%, the ONS said.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the activity in this sector was the main reason the economy had grown more quickly than expected.He said this might be ""due to a temporary boost to production which will unwind"" in the second quarter of the year.Construction output also rose faster than expected, perhaps because of the warmer than usual weather in February, he added.Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, also highlighted these areas as the main surprises in the data.But she said: ""Growth does not appear to have been significantly boosted by stockpiling ahead of Brexit.""Instead, she said that while businesses have been stockpiling it is because they have been importing more. Imports rose by 5.3% in the three months to February while exports rose just 0.8%, according to the ONS.She said: ""Admittedly, the Brexit chaos may have sapped the economy of its momentum in March, as that is when the Brexit uncertainty has been greatest.""All told, though, the solid growth rate in the three months to February should ease immediate fears of the economy stalling or contracting in the first quarter and provides support to our view that the economy is well placed to cope with whatever Brexit throws up next,"" she said.Mr Tombs said he was revising up his forecast for growth in the first quarter to 0.4% from 0.3%, which indicates annual growth of between 1.8% and 2%. This could point to a rate rise from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.""So the data, together with strong wage growth, put renewed pressure on the MPC to follow through on its commitment to an 'ongoing tightening of monetary policy', despite continued Brexit uncertainty,"" he said."
business	Trump urges Fed to help economy 'go up like a rocket'		"President Donald Trump has stepped up his criticism of the US Federal Reserve and called for the central bank to cut interest rates by 1%.The Fed is set to announce a decision on interest rates on Wednesday following a two-day meeting.It has already indicated it is unlikely to change rates from the current range of 2.25%-2.5% for the rest of the year.However, Mr Trump wants the Fed to cut borrowing costs to help the US economy ""go up like a rocket"".Recent figures showed that US GDP grew at a faster-than-expected pace of 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019.Inflation growth slowed to 1.6% in the year to March compared to 1.7% in February, putting it further below the Fed's target of 2% inflation.Mr Trump, who has attacked the Fed and its chairman Jerome Powell on a number of occasions, tweeted that China was doing well because the government was providing economic stimulus as well as keeping interest rates low.He called for the Fed to restart quantitative easing (QE), a practice where a central bank pumps money into the economy through buying assets such as government bonds.QE was launched in the US in 2008 amid the financial downturn and the great recession. The Fed stopped it in 2014 and is running down the assets it bought during that time.Mr Trump nominated Mr Powell as the Fed's chairman and since joining in February last year it has raised interest rates four times, drawing criticism from the president.Meanwhile, Stephen Moore, Mr Trump's pick to join the Fed's board of governors, is facing an uphill battle to win a confirmation if he is nominated.On Tuesday, Republican senator and Trump ally Lindsey Graham said: ""It will be a very problematic nomination.""While Joni Ernst, also a Republican senator, said it is ""very unlikely that I would support that person"".Another Trump pick, Herman Cain recently withdrew from being nominated to the Fed board, stating that it would mean a pay cut. But prior to that, four Republican senators said they would vote against him.Mr Moore advised Mr Trump during his presidential campaign and has been critical of the Fed's decision to raise interest rates last year.He has come under fire for making a number of derogatory comments about women in columns he wrote some years ago.In one, Mr Moore criticised the practice of allowing a woman to referee a basketball game with male players, remarking: ""I see it as an obscenity.""Remarking on his wife's decision to vote for a Democrat in 2000, he said: ""Women are sooo malleable! No wonder there's a gender gap.""In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, he said that a drop in male earnings was the biggest problem facing the US economy.He said: ""I want everybody's wages to rise, of course. People are talking about women's earnings. They've risen,"""
business	Is the UK economy at a new moment of sea-change?	Is Britain working?One nation?Tax and spendAt a crossroads	"Forty years ago this week Margaret Thatcher came to power. At that time there was a sense of broken economy, broken politics, over-powerful trade unions and politicians who seemed only capable of managing decline.Fast forward to now and we again see chaotic politics and widespread sense of economic disaffection. So are we facing another sea-change moment for the UK and its economy?During the 1984 miners' strike the colliers of Shirebrook in Derbyshire were divided over the industrial dispute with Mrs Thatcher's government. The colliery's long gone and it's now the site of a Sport Direct warehouse.Of course, Sports Direct has brought thousands of jobs to the town but the testimony from one warehouse employee, Sam - it's not his real name - shows just how little power some UK workers have.He describes toiling alongside colleagues who don't have a permanent contract despite 10 years of continuous service: ""We're asking to be treated like humans, like good workers, with respect.""Sports Direct did not respond to BBC requests to comment.Sixty miles across the Peak District is Oldham, named by the Office for National Statistics not long ago as the most deprived town in England.Its textile industry fell into decline in the mid-20th Century with the last mill closing in 1998. The end of textile processing has seriously depressed the local economy.Gillian Holt, who has run a beauty parlour in Oldham since 1980, tells me how things have changed: ""When I first came here it was thriving - we had a florist, baker, jeweller, lovely clothes shops.""We have none of those now. We have a lot more charity and bargain shops. It really has changed quite dramatically,"" she says.Some say that change is now coming for Sam, Gillian - and for millions of workers, students, families and pensioners across the UK.""No one is advocating the neoliberal economic policies that they were nine years ago. Even this government has gone quiet on it,"" says Labour's shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.""Tax cuts for corporations and the rich, trickle-down economics, privatisation, outsourcing, the market will always know best - all of those elements are now being questioned. Why? Because people know the system hasn't worked for them.""Opposition politicians always say it's time for a change, but a surprising number of people across the political spectrum agree.""It looks to me the message from the British public is: enough,"" says Jim O'Neill, who was a Conservative Treasury minister between 2015 and 2016.""The ideas are changing,"" says the economist Diane Coyle of Cambridge University. ""That Thatcherite sense of people making choices as individuals, the private sector being dominant - the character of the economy has changed making that much less valid an assumption.""Even some government ministers agree radical change is in the air.""I do think there something is happening, something big,"" says the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss. ""We went through a few years - the Blair years, the Cameron years - where it was all about managerial politics.""Now we are having a more fundamental debate about our economy.""Perhaps you could call it the 40-year itch, as it is now four decades since Margaret Thatcher led the Conservatives to that general election victory in May 1979.At the time, the defeated Labour leader James Callaghan summed it up thus: ""There are times... when there is a sea-change in politics. It then does not matter what you say or what you do. There is a shift in what the public wants and what it approves of.There was a popular yearning for a radical break and even Mrs Thatcher's opponents felt it.""I was a young trade union official. On the doorstep you knew that people wanted some form of change,"" recalls Mr McDonnell.That election victory has gone down in history as a fundamental rupture of the post-war consensus. Out went ""incomes policies"" for workers, central planning and full employment goals. In came deregulation, free markets, tax cuts and privatisation.Fast forward to the present days and we again find chaotic politics and a widespread sense of economic disaffection. So is this another pivotal moment for the UK?""People have got used to the idea that wages rise year by year but for a 10-year period following the crash of 2008 they saw no increase in their living standards,"" says Lord Heseltine, a minister in Mrs Thatcher's government in 1979.""That created a deep sense of frustration, particularly outside the honey pot of London and the South East.""That frustration has driven support for an array of radical policy ideas, from a Universal Basic Income or a four-day week to a jobs guarantee.Some see the future as major expansion of the co-operative movement, where an enterprise is owned not by shareholders but its workers. ""The conventional workplace, it's not very fulfilling,"" says Kayleigh Walsh, part of the Outlandish tech co-operative in London.Frances O'Grady of the Trade Union Congress advocates a restoration of trade unions' power and influence to deal with the exploitation of the rapidly expanding gig economy: ""Young workers are telling us that they want the right to guaranteed hours. It's a basic right that you should be able to build a life on a decent steady job.""But Liz Truss sees a danger in over-regulation of businesses and insists rising self-employment and the gig economy should be regarded as a liberation, not a prison.""We've never had a more capable, more informed, group of citizens in this country. What people want is to make the decisions themselves - they don't want someone in Whitehall telling them what to do.""What all seem to agree on is that the future of work in the 21st Century could and should involve much more autonomy for individual workers.""The flexible nature of work is a big plus and we should embrace it,"" says former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King, who adds that he now regards himself as part of the gig economy.If there's a new consensus on regional policy it's that there should be a radical devolution of power to help ""left behind"" cities and towns across the UK catch up - places like Oldham, where Gillian Holt lives and works.""Whatever the qualities and talents of people making decisions at the centre, very often what motivates them is political considerations, or their own career, which have nothing to do with the local areas about which they are making decisions,"" says Lord King.""I do think we are a overly centralised country. I think the ultimate devolution is to people themselves. I always believe that people make the best decisions about their own lives,"" agrees Liz Truss.If this comes to pass, it will mean more decisions on education, skills training and transport being taken by local politicians rather than those in Westminster.After almost a decade of public sector austerity, it's widely felt that our public services need more funding.""It's got to be the first time in 20 years we've seen more than one opinion poll showing the British appetite to pay taxes seems to be changing,"" says Lord O'Neill.""It looks to me than sensible governments should consider higher taxes, especially to prioritise public service investment.""And it's not just taxation but the broader role of the state where attitudes seem to have shifted.Extensive polling for the Legatum Institute in 2017 found strong UK public support for statements such as ""the pay of execs should be capped"" and ""government needs to do more to regulate how businesses behave"".It found strongly negative connotations in the public mind with ""capitalism"" and a more positive impression of ""socialism"".But though Frances O'Grady of the TUC thinks the right way forward for the country is clear, she admits she is not sure which way the country will actually break.""Is it going to be that slash-and-burn vision that some backbenchers on the right of the Tory party would like to see? Free market fundamentalism, remove the last remaining rights of trade unions and workers? Or is it going to be a positive vision, where we're looking for a much more equal Britain?""""It will be a revolution,"" says a confident Mr McDonnell. ""We've got to transform society. What we're talking about is a new economy that we want to create - much more democratic at every level"".Labour promises higher taxes on the wealthy, an expansion of public investment, the re-nationalisation of certain utilities and moves to give workers a stake in their firms.But does this add up to a genuine new philosophy of how our increasingly digital economy should work? For some that remains the missing piece of the jigsaw.""Now as in 1979 the conditions are ripe for quite significant change,"" says Diane Coyle. ""The difference is that at that time there was a coalescing of certain ideas which gave Thatcher and her government a clear idea of what they wanted to do.""No one in politics now has the vision of what that 'post post-industrial', very unequal, economy does now to deliver lasting prosperity for everyone around the country.""BBC Newsnight is broadcast at 22:30 on BBC Two, and you can find out more on this story here"
business	China economy: Manufacturing sector returns to growth in March	Chinese stimulus	China's manufacturing sector saw a surprise return to growth in March following government efforts to boost the economy.The Caixin/Markit survey, released on Monday, rose to 50.8 in March from 49.9 in February. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.Official manufacturing figures published a day earlier also pointed to a jump in activity.Beijing has taken steps to support the economy to combat slowing growth.The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to an eight-month high of 50.8 in March, beating the 49.9 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.The result echoed China's official PMI data released on Sunday. It showed manufacturing activity rose to 50.5 in March, from 49.2 in February.The official PMI data looks at activity at larger manufacturers, while the private survey from Caixin and Markit focuses on smaller to medium-sized companies in the sector.The stronger-than-expected data sent Asian stocks higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.7% while the Shanghai Composite jumped 2.3%.The upbeat factory data indicated that efforts to boost the world's second largest economy are starting to bear fruit.China reported its weakest economic expansion in 28 years in 2018, and growth is expected to slow further.Beijing has unveiled a series of measures - including cutting taxes - to help support the economy.
business	How protests pushed Hong Kong to the recession brink	'Devastating effect'Shoppers vanishConfidence hit	"Tourists are staying away and retailers are reeling after nearly five months of protests that have dealt a ""devastating"" blow to businesses in Hong Kong, and pushed the economy to the brink.Growth figures issued on Thursday showed Hong Kong has entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.In the third quarter, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.2% from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.4%.Ahead of the numbers, the city's leader Carrie Lam warned of a looming recession. She expects the economy to record negative growth for the year.DBS economist Samuel Tse agrees the upcoming figures will show Hong Kong has sunk into recession - and expects more pain to come.""We don't think it will rebound that fast,"" Mr Tse says.The protests - which began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China - have piled pressure on existing economic strains.Hong Kong has been grappling with the US-China trade war, while a weaker yuan has hit spending from mainland visitors and bruised consumer sentiment.The controversial extradition bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrations continued and evolved into demands for greater freedoms, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.Those dramatic scenes have kept tourists away.In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Visitor numbers are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to the previous year.Many hotels are struggling to fill their rooms and Mr Tse says the vacancy rate is sitting around 60%.Some hotels have slashed prices in the hopes of winning back tourists, while reports suggest many have forced staff to cut work hours or take leave to cope with the slowdown.Among those to have taken a hit is Ovolo Group. The firm, which operates four hotels in Hong Kong, has seen occupancy rates fall by up to 30% over the past three months.""It's devastating to see the effect that the recent situation in our city has had on local businesses, particularly those of us in the hospitality industry,"" Ovolo Group's chief executive Girish Jhunjhnuwala says.Mr Jhunjhnuwala says business is holding up better on weekdays as most guests choose to leave before the weekend, when protests typically kick off. The firm has introduced flexible cancellation policies to help offset uncertainty for guests.With fewer tourists flying in, airlines have also been knocked. Days of protests at Hong Kong's airport in August, one of the world's busiest transit hubs, led to widespread flight cancelations.Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers to the territory in the past two months, while Qantas said the protests would hit first-half earnings by A$25m ($17m; £13m).Lighter tourist flows have weighed on retailers in the city, many already battling with softening consumer sentiment from local shoppers.Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours while workers report fears over their safety as protests have turned violent.Certain businesses have faced direct attacks.Vandals have targeted big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have also repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire.The chaos has led to a sharp fall in retail sales, down 23% in August, the biggest drop on record. The decline in September is expected to be even worse.Additionally, the long-running unrest has shaken business confidence and frustrated investment. That could have a more lasting impact on the economy, Mr Tse says, as questions and uncertainty remain over Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.The city has so far injected more than HK$20bn to combat the slowdown including help for the transport, tourism and retail sectors. More relief measures are expected.But the government argues there's only so much it can do to stem the economic slide.""To truly cure the problem, we must always work together to stop the violence, stop the destruction of traffic infrastructure and specific target shops, banks and institutions… and let the society recover as soon as possible,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.""Our society and the economy need to take a breather and need to get back on the road."""
business	Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending?	'Remain bonus'	"The Liberal Democrats are, on the face of it, planning the most austere form of fiscal policy of the major parties.Unlike both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, they have positioned their aim for the taxes raised annually over and above the day-to-day costs of public services to run a surplus of 1%.This compares with aiming for balance - zero surplus or deficit - in three years for the Conservatives or five years for Labour.It is stricter than both their fiscal targets and means more tax rises or spending cuts would be required.""The Liberal Democrats are the only party of sound finance,"" said their shadow chancellor, Sir Ed Davey, in a speech this week.In practice, this would mean, set against Labour or Conservative plans, having to find some tax rises or spending cuts immediately.Sir Ed has promised to put up both corporation tax and capital gains tax for that purpose.Actually, the Lib Dems also assume what they call a ""remain bonus"" of extra tax income from a larger economy arising from not leaving the European Union.Capital spending on future investments, such as railways and hospitals, would be allowed outside of this limit, but only where vetted by an independent watchdog to generate more money for the taxpayer than the initial cost of borrowing.This is a similar plan to that outlined by Labour's John McDonnell, targeting not the stock of debt, but the increase in the value of assets, too - what is known as a ""net worth"" target.It should allow considerable capital investment, £100bn of which would be spread out over the lifetime of the next Parliament to deal with climate change.There is an extra £7bn for schools and college buildings and £10bn on hospitals.There is an option to abandon the target in a downturn and, instead, target a current deficit of 1%.But if there is no such occurrence, these rules on day-to-day spending are tighter than the others."
business	Alibaba: Why the e-commerce giant is betting on Hong Kong	A boost for Hong Kong?Back to its roots	"Political protests and petrol bombs aren't the ideal backdrop for a top global company looking to raise billions of dollars from investors.But that's exactly what Alibaba is doing.The Chinese e-commerce giant is preparing to raise at least $11bn (£8.5bn) by listing its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange next week, in what could be the year's biggest public share sale.""Hong Kong is one of the world's most important financial centers,"" reads a letter to potential investors from Alibaba's chairman, Daniel Zhang.""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright.""That's a pretty optimistic assessment given the violence on university campuses and the streets of Hong Kong this week alone.So why now? And what does the multi-billion dollar listing tell us about investor confidence in Hong Kong?Sources close to the company say political unrest in Hong Kong wasn't a factor in whether to go ahead with the listing, and the social upheaval doesn't appear to have affected appetite for Alibaba's shares.The share offer closed ahead of schedule, which means that investors snapped up the stock at a faster pace than expected.But some say the timing of the listing is questionable.Max Bondurri, founder of SGMC Capital, says Alibaba could have raised more funds if it had waited.""From a purely economic point of view they could have waited till next year to list, at a time when some of the unrest may perhaps have died down.""However, he believes the decision to list now was motivated also by political, rather than purely financial, concerns.""The suggestion is that Beijing can influence decision-making at Chinese companies to serve its political interests.""It's an attempt to take the negative headlines away from what's going on in the streets and universities,"" he says.""It will help to remind international investors that Hong Kong is still open for business.""Still, the protests have had an impact. The listing event itself is likely to be low-key and low-profile.It is unclear whether Jack Ma, the exuberant former chairman whose name has become synonymous with the e-commerce giant, will attend. It's also not clear if Mr Zhang will be there.This raises questions about the level of concern the firm might have about potential violence outside the exchange or near its executives.Investors won't queue up outside the exchange or banks to get their hands on paper receipts because Alibaba has decided to go paperless for this listing - the first time a firm has done so in Hong Kong. Some have said this is to avoid the risk of protestors attacking investors who might be out on the streets.Alibaba's listing is likely to distract from the violence playing out on the streets, for a few days at least.It may also reassure investors that if a giant such as Alibaba is willing to take the risk and list its shares in Hong Kong, the city's reputation as a financial hub must still be intact.Weijian Shan, the man often described as Asia's private equity ""king"", told me the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was the only ""bright spot"" in an economy currently beset by violent turmoil and recession.More than two hundred Chinese companies are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, making up almost half of the exchange's value.Their value is unlikely to be affected by the day-to-day protests, although negative sentiment from the political crisis no doubt filters through to the stock market in moments of heightened tension.Still, concerns over Hong Kong's reputation should be taken seriously - and it's not just because of the unrest.Increasingly, there's a perception in the business community that Beijing calls the shots in Hong Kong.This week, Chinese state media came out strongly against a decision by Hong Kong's courts that the anti-mask ban was unconstitutional, raising fears that Beijing will wade in even further.This potentially threatens the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary, the sole reason international companies come to the city and list there.Hong Kong's courts are - for now at least - still independent from China's. The more that fades, the more Hong Kong's future as an international financial centre is diminished - whether companies like Alibaba choose to list there or not.Against a complicated political backdrop, Alibaba has long expressed a desire to bring the company ""home"" to Hong Kong.It had hoped to list its shares there in 2014, when the firm first went public. But the city's listing rules at the time meant it made more sense for the company to float in New York.An investor in Alibaba's US shares told me that the Hong Kong listing was a ""genius move"", because it will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy shares in a company they know well.""Expect the shares to pop on the first day of trade,"" says the investor, who didn't want to be named.""Mainland Chinese investors will want to show their support for a company they see as one of their own.""Even though Alibaba has no shortage of cash, the Hong Kong listing could help to raise money for future challenges, especially in the US.""Because of the US-China trade war, there's more scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the US,"" he says.""If Alibaba raises this cash in Hong Kong, it allows them to potentially delist their shares in the US if they run into any trouble with US authorities in the future over any potential national security concerns.""For now, Alibaba says there are no plans to delist its shares in the US.""The New York Stock Exchange is the primary listing venue"" an Alibaba spokesperson told me. ""We will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange."""
business	Clouds gathering over global economy	TrumponomicsEscalating tariffs?European slowdownGlobal TradeRecession predictors?	"What does 2019 have in store for the global economy?There are certainly clouds on the horizon, but 2018 as a whole was a reasonably strong year.Global growth will probably be about 3.7% when all the numbers are in, according to the International Monetary Fund.The world's two biggest economies are likely to record respectable rates of expansion.The biggest of all, the US, had two very strong quarters in the middle of the year. Data for the final three months will come at the end of January, and while they might well show some slowing down, the whole year is likely to register pretty strong expansion of close to 3%.As for China, the slowdown after three decades of stunning growth continues. But it's still likely to be about 6.6% in 2018, which is more than enough to generate significant improvements in average living standards.Most mainstream forecasts suggest that the recovery after the great recession will continue for another year and more.So what about the clouds?Growth in the US is likely to be slower. The surge in 2018 reflected President Trump's tax cuts. There is some debate about whether the impact will last. Is it a one-off effect that will fade like a sugar rush, or will it have a lasting impact on incentives to work and invest?There is also the impact of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, to consider. Will it continue raising interest rates to keep inflation close to its 2% target following the four such moves it made in 2018?President Trump certainly thinks the Fed could do a lot of harm. It is, he has said, ""the only problem our economy has"".He has repeatedly made similar points, to the extent that his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, felt the need to say publicly that the president had no desire to sack the Fed chairman Jerome Powell. (It's not clear whether he has the authority to do that, but he certainly could decline to give him another term as chairman when the current one expires in 2022, if he is still president then).In any event, the prospect of the president exerting what many would consider undue influence over the Fed has the potential to unsettle financial markets. The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy, which includes interest rate policy, by Congress.The mainstream view among economists is that keeping that away from the centre of the political arena is better for the long-term control of inflation.There is another strand to President Trump's economic policy that could undermine economic growth: international trade.The US is already well into a major trade confrontation with China over what President Trump calls the theft by China of the technology of American companies doing business there.Three months into the year, the tariffs that his administration has already imposed on a wide array of Chinese goods are due to increase from 10% to 25%. China can be expected to retaliate as it did to the first round of tariffs.It is true that Presidents Trump and Xi have held some talks and it is possible that the escalation will be averted. But it is certainly not assured.And then there are the US tariffs on steel and aluminium, ostensibly imposed to protect national security, which have affected a large number of US trade partners.The prospect of continued trade tensions is a significant cloud over the economic outlook.Europe also has its own problems. The economic data for the third quarter of the year showed a marked slowdown in growth in the eurozone.Some of this may be a very short-term stumble due to new procedures for testing vehicle emissions, which have disrupted the motor industry. But it could be the start of a more significant loss of momentum in a recovery that was never particularly strong.A survey of manufacturing industry in the region showed the slowdown continued in December with a contraction in two individual economies, Italy and France.Europe also has its own trade issue to worry about: Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. There is a wide range of possible outcomes, some of which could disrupt trade between the UK and the continent.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Stock markets had a rough ride at the end of 2018. Many recorded strong gains early in the year that were more than reversed. Overall it was the worst year for global markets (and many individual ones) since the financial crisis.Lower share prices can be a warning sign of wider economic problems ahead, sometimes even a recession. But share price falls are not a reliable sign of a coming recession.As the late Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson once joked: ""Wall Street indexes predicted nine of the last five recessions."" The market can give false alarms.The bond market, where debts including government bonds, are traded, has also been close to flashing a warning about the US outlook.A phenomenon known as the inverted yield curve has been a more reliable predictor of a downturn, though not very precise as to when.That said, there are economists who think the US may be heading for a recession, not this year but in 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who foresaw the financial crisis, is one. He also warns that the recession he predicts will be harder for the government and Federal Reserve to deal with.China also has things to worry about - in the shape of a rising burden of public and private-sector debt, which could yet undermine financial stability. Surveys of business showed that new orders for manufacturers declined in December, for the first time in two years.All things told, there are some pretty clear reasons for regarding the outlook now as a good deal harder to read and more overcast than it has been for several years."
business	Hong Kong stocks slide as violent protests continue	Why are there protests in Hong Kong?	"Hong Kong stocks have fallen again as another day of anti-government protests cast a shadow over the city and rattled investors.The Hang Seng index lost 2.2%, outpacing falls across Asia, continuing a downward path since Monday.It comes amid more clashes between protesters and police, and the partial closure of the transport network.Unrest has gripped the Asian financial hub for nearly five months, knocking the economy and business confidence.This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.""The situation in Hong Kong has taken a decidedly dark turn this week with the violence and economic disruption seemingly gathering pace,"" Oanda analyst Jeff Halley said.He said worries about intervention by Beijing have ""ratcheted materially higher"" keeping Asian markets ""cautious at best"".The protests have dealt a blow to the local economy and Hong Kong recently tipped into recession. Tourism and retail businesses have been among those hardest hit as travellers stay away.""Social unrest, coupled with uncertainty from the US-China trade tensions, have dampened overall business sentiment in Hong Kong,"" IHS Markit analyst Maojun Ye said.At the Chinese University of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters started fires and threw petrol bombs.Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications.Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."
business	Hong Kong's leader issues fresh recession warning		"Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy.The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors.The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession.That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome.To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; £2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors.Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details.Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said.The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.Those protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record."
business	US economy adds 304,000 jobs in January	Hiring demandWage pressure	"The US economy added a stronger-than-expected 304,000 jobs in January, official figures have shown.The figure was far in excess of economists' forecasts of 165,000.However, December's jobs growth figure was revised to 222,000, down from an initial estimate of 312,000.Last month saw jobs being added in leisure and hospitality, construction, health care, transportation and warehousing, according to the US Department of Labor.The widespread gains marked the 100th month in a row of hiring.They were a reminder of the economy's continued strength, despite rising concerns about factors such as slowing global growth, trade tensions, and recent dips in consumer confidence.""This is a solid report, particularly given how worried people were,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank.The unemployment rate in January ticked up from 3.9% to 4% - a gain the Labor Department said was due to the partial shutdown of the federal government.The shutdown was also likely to have contributed to a surge in part-time workers last month, the Labor Department said.Overall, however, job creation in the US remains healthy - and well above the roughly 100,000 additions per month need to keep pace with growth in the working-age population.US employers added an average of 223,000 jobs per month in 2018.Separate surveys have also found more job openings than unemployed.""A lot of businesses feel like they do need to find workers and they have felt that way for months,"" Mr Faucher said.""We have consumers spending, we have businesses investing, so the demand is there.""The Federal Reserve this week pledged to be ""patient"" about further rate rises, noting that inflation pressures remain muted.But the tight labour market has started to translate into higher wages.The average hourly pay for private sector workers was $27.56 last month, up 3.2% year-on-year.That was slightly slower than December's 3.3% rise. But it still marked one of the strongest year-on-year increases for any month since the financial crisis.Analysts said January's gains do not put immediate pressure on the bank to raise rates.But several economists said the bank is likely to increase rates later in 2019, if trends continue.""This is a strong report, showing that labour demand continues to rise rapidly, and that wage gains continue to grind higher,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.""If wage gains rise over the next year as much they have over the past year ... the idea that the Fed won't hike further will turn to dust."""
business	Brexit deal means ‘£70bn hit to UK by 2029'	Slowing demand	"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will leave the UK £70bn worse off than if it had remained in the EU, a study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has found.It concluded that GDP would be 3.5% lower in 10 years' time under the deal.The independent forecaster's outlook is one of the first assessments of how the economy will fare under the new deal.But the Treasury said it plans on a 'more ambitious' agreement with the EU than 'NIESR is basing its findings on'.A spokesman said: ""We are aiming to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union, which is more ambitious than the standard free trade deal that NIESR has based its findings on.""NIESR said approval of the prime minister's deal ""would reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome, but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU"".Despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ""hinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would be if the UK stayed in the EU,"" NIESR said.""We estimate that, in the long run, the economy would be 3.5% smaller with the deal compared to continued EU membership,"" it added.The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa May's deal of last year.Her deal would have reduced the size of the economy by 3% over the same period, NIESR said.Founded in 1938, NIESR has no party political ties and is the UK's oldest independent economic research institute.A year ago, it conducted a study commissioned by the People's Vote which said GDP would be 3.9% lower by 2030.Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney welcomed the new Brexit deal, saying it was a ""net economic positive"" as it ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"".However, the governor said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated with the EU meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the UK economy as the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor Mrs May.Chancellor Sajid Javid has refused to recalculate Treasury assessments on the impact of the government's Brexit deal, saying it is ""self-evidently in our economic interest"".NIESR's study modelled different Brexit scenarios against a baseline of the UK staying in the EU.In the case of a no-deal Brexit, it said, the economy would shrink by 5.6%.The government would dearly love to compare its agreement to the prospect of no deal.On that basis, Boris Johnson's renegotiation looks better - on standard economic models such as those deployed by the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research.""New deal versus no deal"" was the argument put to MPs when the Prime Minister was still trying to pass his deal. It was the position of the Chancellor, when he refused to publish his own version of such an analysis saying it was ""self-evidently"" better.But we are now in a different situation.The Prime Minister's deal is being put to the electorate versus a remain option or a different, far softer form of Brexit.Crucially, NIESR calculates that the Johnson renegotiation leads to a slightly worse economic outcome than Theresa May's deal which it replaces, as the Bank of England Governor hinted to me earlier this month.What is driving these results? The new deal creates more distance from the European Union economy, with more regulatory barriers to trade. Unlike May's deal, there could be checks on the origin of parts in the car industry, for example.The overall impact of these extra barriers outweighs the benefit from extra certainty of ""getting Brexit done"". Individual businesses may well disagree. But the Treasury itself has chosen not to issue its own version of analysis such as this, even though it has the capacity to do so.If the terms of trade with the EU remained unchanged, but ""chronic uncertainty"" persisted, GDP would be 2% lower.""The economic outlook is clouded by significant economic and political uncertainty and depends critically on the United Kingdom's trading relationships after Brexit,"" NIESR said.""Domestic economic weakness is further amplified by slowing global demand.""According to NIESR, the effects of Brexit on the UK economy are already being felt.""The economy is estimated to be 2.5% smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote,"" it said."
business	China economy: Annual growth slowest since 1990	Analysis: Wider implications?Slowdown warnings	"China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, stoking fears about the impact on the global economy.China expanded at 6.6% in 2018, official figures out Monday showed.In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter.The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy.China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook.The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis.While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory.By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondentChina's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth.But still, we should be worried.Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world.It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us.Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy.Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market.Earlier this month Apple warned weakness in China would hit its sales.Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US.China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption.Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy.Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold.Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 ""but held up better than many feared"".""Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year."""
business	China economy: Beijing unveils $298bn tax cuts to boost growth	'Easing US tensions'	"China's number two leader Li Keqiang has warned the country faces ""a tough struggle,"" as he laid out plans to prop up the world's second-largest economy.Opening the annual session of China's parliament, he forecast slower growth of 6% - 6.5% this year, down from a target of around 6.5% in 2018.China has struggled with a slowing economy and a US-led trade war.It plans to boost spending, increase foreign firms' access to its markets, and cut billions of dollars in taxes.""In pursuing development this year, we will face a graver and more complicated environment as well as risks and challenges... that are greater in number and size,"" Mr Li said in a lengthy speech.""We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle.""Mr Li told 3,000 delegates at the National People's Congress that China would aim to deliver nearly 2 trillion yuan ($298bn; £227bn) of cuts in taxes and other company fees.A value-added tax (VAT) for transportation and construction sectors will be sliced from 10% to 9%, and VAT for manufacturers will fall from 16% to 13%, he said.China will increase its military budget by 7.5% to 1.2 trillion yuan, down from last year's 8.1% rise.The country's defence spending is closely watched for any signals as to its military intentions.Mr Li also said China would continue to carry out a prudent monetary policy and use reserve requirements as policy tools. China cut reserve requirements - the amount commercial banks are required to hold on reserve - several times last year to boost lending.The economy expanded 6.6% in 2018, growing at is slowest rate since 1990.Mr Li also announced that Beijing would further relax controls over access to Chinese markets for foreign companies.BBC China Correspondent Stephen McDonell says this appears to be an attempt to ease trade tensions with the US.Both countries imposed billions of dollars worth of tariffs on one another's goods last year.Even though officials have sounded more upbeat about negotiations with the US recently, failure to achieve a deal would see tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods rise almost immediately and could see the US impose fresh tariffs."
business	Bank split on rates as it warns Brexit deal would hit growth	What's the outlook for growth?What else did the Bank say about Brexit?What's the outlook for interest rates?Will Mark Carney delay his departure from the Bank?	"The Bank of England has warned that weak global growth and trade barriers created by the government's Brexit deal will hit the UK economy.It came as two Bank policymakers called for an immediate interest rate cut to support growth.The Bank voted 7-2 to keep interest rates on hold at 0.75%.The Bank said the new EU withdrawal agreement struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson had reduced the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates said this would end some of the uncertainty facing businesses and households.However, policymakers added that the transition to a new trade deal would introduce new customs checks and regulatory barriers.The MPC said its assumption of a Canada-style ""deep free-trade agreement"" between the UK and EU would ""raise administrative costs for firms"" doing business with the continent.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the Brexit deal had created ""the prospects for a pick-up in UK growth"".The Bank expects the annual pace of growth to rise from around 1% at the end of this year to more than 2% by the end of 2022.Mr Carney said this would be helped by ""a world that has stopped weakening and picks up a little bit"".He added: ""three-quarters of that rise in growth is driven by domestic factors - the most important of which is a reduction in uncertainty driven by an orderly transition to a new Brexit arrangement.""However, the Bank's Monetary Policy Report said a weaker global economy and its new assumptions about Brexit would knock 1% off UK growth over the next three years compared with its forecast in August.Policymakers believe the UK economy grew 0.4% in the three months to September this year, double their estimate in August, amid a recovery in the UK's dominant services sector.However, growth in the final quarter of the year is expected to fall back to 0.2%.Spending pledges by the government are expected to boost growth in the coming years.The Bank also cited research that showed the current level of business investment is about 11% lower because of Brexit uncertainty.For the first time, Bank policymakers changed their assumption about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU.They had previously assumed an average of a range of Brexit outcomes that filter through to the economy over 15 years.It now assumes the government will strike a free-trade agreement with Brussels that will keep goods tariffs at zero but introduce customs checks at the border.With the transition period currently due to expire at the end of 2020, the drag on growth from new regulatory barriers will now be more immediate.Policymakers said: ""As a result, trade flows are likely to fall and some companies might exit the market.""Diverging regulations are also expected to hit a wide variety of sectors across the EU, from law to banking.The Bank also suggested that trade deals with new partners would be years away, reflecting the fact that ""it typically takes several years for new trade deals to be negotiated and implemented"".Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel, two of the Bank's external rate-setters, voted to cut interest rates to 0.5%, from the current rate of 0.75%.They said inflation, which currently stands at 1.7%, suggested that there was little risk that the economy would overheat in the medium term if interest rates were cut.The MPC expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall to about 1.2% by next spring as the impact of the government's energy price cap kicks in.This is well below the Bank's 2% target.While the unemployment rate remains below 4%, which is its lowest since the 1970s, Mr Saunders and Mr Haskel said they believed recent data suggested the ""labour market was turning"".They also said there was a risk that world growth could be weaker and Brexit uncertainties could persist for longer than the MPC's assumptions.Financial markets believe interest rates will be cut to 0.5% in the coming year, and Mr Carney said the MPC would respond to developments in the economy accordingly.Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers, as commercial banks use the Bank of England as a reference point for the rates they offer on mortgages and savings accounts.Bank governor Mark Carney is due to stand down from his role on 31 January next year. However, at the Bank's news conference, he opened the door to staying on beyond that date.He said that he had already agreed to extend his term twice, in order to ensure the financial system was prepared for Brexit and also to ensure a proper handover to his successor.Mr Carney said it was understandable that a decision on the new governor had not been made, ""given the priority"" that the Brexit negotiations have taken.He committed to making sure that the transition to the new governor was ""smooth""."
business	Freelancers should be paid higher minimum wage, says think tank	Financial trainingWage promises	"Contractors and other flexible workers should enjoy a higher minimum wage than those with secure employment, the Demos think tank has urged.A higher rate would insulate workers from some of the risk they face as a result of unsecure earnings.The think tank also suggests that banks or trade unions could administer benefits such as holiday pay.The report, financed by NatWest bank, suggested access to loans and mortgages was poorer for flexible workers.""Self-employed workers are not protected by the safety net that many of us take for granted, from sick pay to maternity cover,"" said author Ben Glover""This bargain is only fair if self-employed people earn enough to cover the additional risk they take on, but too often in Britain today this is simply not happening. That's why we are calling for a new, higher minimum wage for the self-employed.""Having another body rather than government oversee employment benefits would be similar to the so-called Ghent system, named after the Belgian city where the idea was piloted. Countries including Denmark have adopted a similar plan.""Workers in these countries voluntarily join unemployment schemes and, after having contributed to these schemes for a certain amount of time, are able to enjoy fairly generous unemployment insurance, amongst other benefits,"" it said.Flexible workers include the self-employed, freelancers, those employed in the so-called gig economy, such as Uber taxi drivers, agency and temporary workers, those on zero hours contracts, and people with several jobs, it said.Demos does not recommend an hourly figure, but says the Low Pay Commission should investigate what it ought to be.Other recommendations include training from the government and banks on managing finances when being self-employed, and automatic pension contributions.At present, the government's National Living Wage pays £8.21 an hour for workers aged 25 and over.For younger workers, the National Minimum Wage is currently set at £7.70 an hour for 21-24 years olds and £6.15 for those aged 18-20.Workers aged 16 to 17 can only expect a minimum hourly wage of £4.35, or £3.90 if they are part of an apprenticeship scheme.The Conservatives plan to lower the age limit for the National Living Wage to 21 and pay around £10.39 per hour by 2024.Labour pledges to introduce a £10 minimum wage in 2020 for all employees aged 16 and over."
business	What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy?	What has happened to households?What about jobs?What about the pound?	"There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave.Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity.What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire.Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU.He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000,""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain.""He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands.Project Fear? Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected.Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant.Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again.But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were £900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum.Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome.Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March.The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead.That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down.As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago.Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health.And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy.After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again.And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis.Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum.A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports.A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination. A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending £24.5bn.In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive. Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected.And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery.What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back.It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself."
business	Why do billions of people still not have glasses?	More things that made the modern economy:	"Making spacecraft is not a job in which you can afford to be slapdash.At Lockheed Martin, for example, it used to take a technician two painstaking days to measure 309 locations for certain fasteners on a particular curved panel.But according to Shelley Peterson, the aerospace company's head of emerging technologies, the same job now takes little more than two hours.What changed? The technician started wearing glasses. But not just any old glasses: specifically, the Microsoft Hololens.It looks like a bulky set of safety goggles. And it layers digital information over the real world. In this case, it scans the curved panel, makes its calculations, and shows the technician exactly where each fastener should go.Productivity experts are gushing about the potential benefits of augmented-reality devices such as the Hololens and Google Glass.When Google first demonstrated its smart glasses in 2012, their prospects seemed quite different. They were seen as a consumer device, something that would let us check Instagram and take videos without the hassle of reaching for our phones.They did not catch on. The few people who ventured out in public wearing Google Glass attracted the dismissive soubriquet ""glassholes"".Google soon realised it had misidentified its target market, so reinvented the glasses for the workplace. Many jobs, after all, involve frequent pauses to consult a screen that tells us what to do next.With smart specs, we can see those instructions while we keep working. It saves a vital few seconds in getting information from internet to brain.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A thousand years ago, information travelled rather more slowly.In Cairo, in the 1010s, the Basra-born polymath Hasan Ibn al-Haytham wrote his masterwork, the Book of Optics, but it took two centuries for his insights to be translated beyond Arabic.Haytham understood vision better than anyone before him.Some earlier scholars, for example, had said the act of seeing must involve some kind of rays being emitted from the eye. By careful experiment, Haytham proved them wrong: light comes into the eyes.Before Haytham, optical devices had been cumbersome: the Roman writer Seneca magnified text using a clear glass bowl of water. But the gradual spread of knowledge inspired new ideas. Some time in the late 1200s came the world's first pair of reading glasses.Who made them is lost to history but they probably lived in northern Italy. Venice, in particular, was a hub of glassmaking at the time - problematically so, as buildings in Venice were made of wood and the glassmakers' furnaces kept starting fires.In 1291, the city's authorities banished the entire trade to the neighbouring island of Murano. By 1301, ""eyeglasses for reading"" were popular enough to feature in the rulebook of the Guild of Venetian Crystal Workers.But historians' biggest clue to the origin of eyeglasses comes from a sermon in 1306 by one Friar Giordano da Pisa. The invention was now 20 years old, he told his congregation in Florence. As Alberto Manguel notes in A History of Reading, the friar declared glasses to be ""one of the most useful devices in the world"".He was right. Reading strained the eyes at the best of times: medieval buildings weren't famed for their big windows and artificial light was dim and expensive.As we age, it becomes harder to focus on close-up objects; middle-aged monks, scholars, notaries and merchants were simply out of luck. Friar Giordino was 50. One can imagine why he appreciated his spectacles so much.But they were useful only to the small minority who could read. When the printing press came along, glasses reached a bigger market. The first specialist spectacle shop opened in Strasbourg in 1466.Manufacturers branched out from convex lenses, which help people see close-up. They learned how to grind concave lenses as well, which help people focus on things far away.Put concave and convex lenses together and you have the basic ingredients for a microscope or a telescope. Both inventions emerged from the spectacle shops of the Netherlands around the year 1600, opening whole new worlds to scientific study.Nowadays we take glasses for granted - in the developed world, at least. A survey by the College of Optometrists suggests about three-quarters of people in the UK wear glasses or contact lenses or have had surgery to correct their vision. It's a similar story in America and Japan.In less developed countries, however, the picture is very different - and only recently did we get a clearer view of it.Historically, the World Health Organization has collected data on people who have really serious problems with their vision only.Many more can see well enough to muddle through daily life but would still benefit from spectacles. But how many? The world's leading lens-maker, Essilor, decided to find out, one assumes not for entirely selfless reasons.In 2012 came the answer: around the world, some two and a half billion people need glasses and don't have them. That's an eye-popping figure but serious people think it's credible.And many of those people may have no idea glasses could help them.In 2017, researchers tested the vision of hundreds of tea-pickers aged 40 or over on a plantation in Assam. They gave a simple $10 (£8.20) pair of reading glasses to half of those who needed them. Then, they compared how much tea was picked by those who wore the glasses and those who didn't.Those with the glasses averaged about 20% more tea. The older they were, the more their tea-picking improved. The tea-pickers are paid by how much tea they pick. Before the study, not one owned glasses. By the end, hardly any wanted to give them back.How widely we can extrapolate from this study is hard to say: picking tea may reward visual acuity more than some other jobs.Still, even conservative estimates put the economic losses from poor eyesight into the hundreds of billions of dollars - and that's before you think about people's quality of life or children struggling at school.One randomised trial concluded giving children glasses could be equivalent to an extra half year of schooling.And the need is growing. Presbyopia is a long-sightedness which comes with age; among children there's now a global epidemic of myopia, or short-sightedness. Researchers aren't sure why, though it may have to do with children spending less time outdoors.What would it take to correct the world's vision? Clearly, more eye doctors would help - the number varies widely from country to country. Greece, for example, has one ophthalmologist for roughly every 5,000 people; in India, it's one per 70,000; in some African countries, it's one per a million.But while serious eye problems demand skilled professionals, people whose needs are more easily fixable could be reached by other workers.In Rwanda, a charity trained nurses to do sight checks; researchers found they did them well over 90% of the time.Could teachers identify students struggling to see? I've worn glasses since primary school, when my teacher saw me squinting at the blackboard and told my mother to take me to an optician.Another study suggests they could. After just a couple of hours of training, teachers at schools in rural China could spot most children who would benefit from wearing glasses.It shouldn't be rocket science to roll out 13th-Century technology.One wonders what Friar Giordano would make of a world in which we build spacecraft in augmented reality but haven't yet helped a couple of billion people fix their fuzzy views of actual reality. He'd probably tell us where to focus.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	Workplace reforms 'will protect gig economy workers'		"Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or ""gig economy"" workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says.Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave.Workers would also be given the right to request more predictable hours.But Labour and the unions say the planned reforms do not go far enough.The reforms are based on the findings of a review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, a former aide to ex-PM Tony Blair and chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts.Ministers say the new legislation will:Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's largest upgrade in workers' rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.""However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ""The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all.""Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist. """"Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour,"" she added.Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the CBI, said: ""[Businesses] welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours, which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.But he said: ""Legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.""The government agrees with the Taylor review that completely banning zero-hour contracts ""would negatively impact more people than it helped"".It also said that platform-based working - including the likes of ride-sharing app Uber or food delivery business Deliveroo - offers ""genuine two-way flexibility"" for firms and workers.Zero-hour contracts, where an employer does not have to offer work and an employee has no obligation to work when asked, are highly controversial.The Archbishop of Canterbury called the contracts ""the reincarnation of an ancient evil""."
business	Economy Energy banned from taking on new customers	'Absolutely infuriating'Protection'Wider problem'	"Energy supplier Economy Energy has been banned from taking on new customers until it improves its customer service.The energy regulator, Ofgem, said the ban would remain in place for three months to allow the firm to improve its customer contact procedures.It must also address billing and payment failures, and issue customer refunds in a timely manner.The company said it was disappointed with the Ofgem ban, but would co-operate with the regulator.Ofgem said if Economy Energy - which has 244,000 customers - failed to improve it could have its licence revoked.One customer who was furious with Economy Energy's service was Mark Johnstone, from Edinburgh.The 51-year-old tried to switch away to another supplier but said the final bills he received from Economy Energy were wrong and the refund he has been due still has not been paid.""Being told by customer service that my refund is on a spreadsheet and they don't know when I'll get the money back is simply not good enough,"" he said.""What they need to do is get people's money back to them in a timely manner. My experience of this company has been absolutely infuriating.""In addition to the ban on new customers, Economy Energy has also been prevented from requesting one-off payments and increasing direct debits.Anthony Pygram, Ofgem's director of conduct and enforcement, said: ""Ofgem is taking action to protect customers from suffering more harm from the unacceptable level of customer service provided by Economy Energy.""We expect the supplier to take immediate action to rectify its failings or face having its ban extended.""All suppliers are required to treat their customers fairly. Where they do not, Ofgem will take the necessary steps to ensure suppliers change their behaviour and to prevent further harm to customers.""If Economy Energy fails to make improvements within three months, Ofgem can extend the ban and, ultimately, cancel the company's licence.A spokesman for Economy Energy said: ""In light of the news received from Ofgem, in which we are very disappointed, we wish to advise our customers we will be co-operating fully with Ofgem and are always committed to continual improvement of our business. We thank our customers for their support.""Matthew Vickers, chief executive at the Energy Ombudsman, which referees disputes between companies and consumers, said: ""In November alone we opened investigations into 399 complaints about the company, compared to just 112 last January.""Common issues include disputed account balances, failure to issue refunds and concerns over billing delays.""Gillian Guy, chief executive of consumers' association Citizens Advice, said: ""Today's action by Ofgem is a welcome and necessary step towards fixing the consistently poor service experienced by Economy Energy customers.""We've raised a number of concerns in recent months about Economy Energy to the regulator. These include failing to refund customer credit balances and not properly billing people switching to a different supplier.""But there's a wider problem behind this news. Ofgem's upcoming licensing review offers a major opportunity to stop underprepared firms entering the market. Further action is needed now to address the ongoing issues caused by poorly performing companies already operating.""In the past year, a number of small energy suppliers have gone bust, including Spark Energy, Extra Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select and Usio Energy."
business	UK economy slows as car sales fall	Why has growth slowed?Analysis: Andy Verity, BBC Economics CorrespondentWhat happened in October?What has happened to the UK's trade balance?What about the coming months?	"Growth in the UK's economy has slowed as car sales fell and the manufacturing sector stalled, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said.The economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to October, slower than the 0.6% in the three months to September.The UK's trade deficit also widened as imports grew faster than exports in October.Economists expect growth to slow in the last three months of the year.The latest three-month growth figure follows a stronger-than-expected set of data for the three months to September, when the economy grew at its fastest pace since late 2016 buoyed by consumers spending in the warm weather.""GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales,"" said Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS. ""This was offset by a strong showing from IT and accountancy.""""Manufacturing saw no growth at all in the latest three months, mainly due to a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry,"" he added.""Construction, while slowing slightly, continued its recent solid performance with growth in housebuilding and infrastructure.""The services sector grew by 0.3% on the three-month rolling measure - the lowest since the three months to April 2018.The sector's performance is closely watched as it makes up 80% of the economy.There were some negative signs in the latest economic growth figures, but on the whole they were benign, with services such as accountancy driving modest economic growth.But here we meet the frustration of lagging economic indicators.If we want to know what effect the upheaval at Westminster over the Brexit withdrawal agreement has had, the more recent indicators tell a less benign story.In November, retail sales grew by 0.5 per cent overall (including online). But if you exclude food they were flat, and sales in shops were down.Similarly, the leading indicator of business activity, the purchasing managers' index which tracks buying decisions by business executives, recorded its worst reading in the services sector since the month after the referendum, July 2016.Activity expanded, but only just.Unfortunately we won't know the effect of Theresa May's troubles on November's economic growth (GDP) until January, by which time it will be far too late to influence decision making.GDP grew by 0.1% in October - after being flat in both September and August.In October, the first month of the last quarter of the year, the services sector was the only major part of the economy to expand.Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing output down 0.9%. Output in the construction industry fell 0.2%.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest growth figures ""come on the heels of more up-to-date survey evidence which suggests the economy is approaching stall speed and could even contract as we move into 2019 unless demand revives"".In October, the UK imported more than it exported despite the weakness in the pound.The trade deficit widened to £3.1bn in October, the ONS said, as imports increased by £3.6bn, faster than the amount exported, which rose by £1.9bn.The ONS also revised the trade data for September, which now shows a deficit of £2.3bn compared with £0.1bn.""The widening in the UK's trade deficit is a concern and reflects a sharp rise in goods imports,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).""Trading conditions for UK exporters are deteriorating amid moderating global growth and uncertainty over Brexit. Businesses continue to report that the persistent weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with the weakening currency raising input costs.""With October marking the start of the fourth quarter, economists said the economy's progress in remaining months of the year could be determined by Brexit negotiations.Mr Williamson said: ""The outlook for growth... very much depends on Brexit developments over the coming days, weeks and months, and the surrounding uncertainty makes forecasting extremely difficult.""However, what's clearly evident is that the widely-expected slowing of the economy in the lead-up to the UK's separation from the EU is now upon us, leaving the big question of whether the economy will bounce back alongside a smooth Brexit process or slide into decline,"" he said.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that surveys of the services sector were also showing weak growth which do ""not augur well"" for the last quarter of the year.Capital Economics is forecasting annual GDP growth of 1.3% for this year - the lowest since the financial crisis."
business	How much has the shutdown hit the US economy?	Where are the losses coming from?But you said the impact was minimal?What if this continues?	"Washington is at a standstill, as US President Donald Trump and Democrats feud over his demand to include $5.7bn (£4.5bn) for a border wall in a new spending bill.The fight has closed parts of federal agencies since 21 December and is on track to be the longest government shutdown in US history.Food inspections have halted. Listings of new companies are on hold. Mortgage approvals have been delayed and the release of certain economic data has been suspended.But how much of a difference does the upheaval make to the economy?For those outraged by the impasse, the answer may be unsatisfying because, at least for now, it appears to be - not much.Economists estimate that the shutdown is likely to shave between about 0.04% and 0.07% of gross domestic product (GDP) off economic growth per week - an average of just over $1bn a week.That is far less than estimated losses of more than $20bn incurred during the 16-day shutdown in 2013, which affected much more of the government.""As long as this shutdown is relatively short, these impacts are going to be fairly modest,"" says Joel Prakken, chief US economist for Macroeconomic Advisors by IHS Markit.The fight has closed parts of most major departments, including the State Department, the Treasury Department and the Department of Homeland Security.The most immediate pain stems from those closures, which mean about 800,000 federal workers will not receive pay this week. Many contractors are also affected.Lila Johnson, 71, is a member of the 32BJ SEIU labour union, which represents about 2,000 custodian and security guard subcontractors at federal agencies involved in the shutdown.Her part-time job, as a custodian at the Department of Agriculture, pays $22.10 an hour and helps to supplement her retirement as she cares for two great-grandsons.But her last pay cheque arrived at the end of December.Ms Johnson is now relying on her Social Security benefit to keep up with car payments, credit card balance and other bills - and is starting to fall behind.""It's a struggle,"" she says. ""I have to pay a little here and a little there. I'm doing the best I can... but people need to go back to work to take care of their families.""While wages for contractors like Ms Johnson are uncertain, in previous shutdowns, federal workers have recouped their pay.Many also earn enough to absorb a hit to their finances without seriously reducing other spending - as long as it's temporary.The average annual compensation, including benefits, of the federal workers affected is more than $100,000, according to Mr Prakken.Most importantly, unlike previous shutdowns, this one involves much less of the government - the bill concerns only about 25% of money Congress allocates to fund the government. And about half of the staff going without pay are still working, minimising wider disruption.There are other losses - such as cancellations at national parks which are closed. But it is likely tourists are spending their dollars elsewhere, mitigating the wider economic effect.""While it is certainly a concern, the size of the impact is rather small,"" says Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global. ""We are a $19 trillion economy after all.""Right now, much of the pain is being felt in areas with large concentrations of federal workers, like Washington, DC, where Moody's Analytics estimates that one in six jobs are potentially affected.But as the shutdown persists, economists warn that the delays and lost pay cheques will start to add up.By Friday, S&P Global estimates the shutdown will have cost the economy $3.6bn. Within two weeks, the firm says losses from the shutdown will be larger than the cost of the wall itself.""Even though it is a small amount, it still hurts,"" Ms Bovino says.Already, the chaos, suggestive as it is of political dysfunction, is likely to have hit confidence.The business world is also worried about missing certain economic data, including retail sales GDP figures, at a time of uncertainty over the economy's direction.""We would have a less clear picture into the economy if it were to go on much longer,"" Federal Reserve chair Jerome ""Jay"" Powell warned on Thursday, adding that an ""extended"" shutdown would hurt growth.Michael Roosevelt, co-owner of a small brewery in New Jersey, expected to open an expansion this month that would allow his Alementary Brewing Co to roughly quadruple its output and lead to the hiring of several new workers.But he's still waiting on a licence from the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is shut, while paying about $1,000 per day to cover the new lease, utilities and equipment loan.""In another week or so, that's when the panic is going to set in,"" he said."
business	World Bank warns of 'darkening skies' for global economy	Change of gearBrexit risk	"The World Bank is warning of increasing risks, or what it calls ""darkening skies"", for the world economy.In its annual assessment of global prospects the Bank predicts continued, though somewhat slower, growth this year and next.The Bank's forecast for the global economy is expansion this year of 2.9% and 2.8% in 2020.But overhanging the broadly favourable outlook are rising concerns that could mean economic performance falls short.There is certainly some good news in this report. While the global economy is slowing down it's likely to be what the Bank's economists call a ""soft landing"". The slowdown started in the middle of last year and it has so far been ""orderly"".The predicted slowdown is focused on the rich countries, particularly the US, although it will continue to expand more rapidly than either the Eurozone or Japan according to the Bank's forecasts.The US slowdown is the result of the fading impact of President Trump's tax cuts and by 2021 its growth will have almost halved - to 1.6% compared with 2.9% last year.On the other hand, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is likely to gather pace somewhat despite the continued cooling down in China - a process which began at the start of the decade.By 2021 growth in China is expected to be 6%, which is still pretty strong, but it is a marked change of gear for an economy that expanded by an average of 10% annually between 1980 and 2010.Franziska Ohnsorge, a World Bank economist and lead author of the report said in a BBC interview: ""In China it's policy engineered, a very deliberate slowdown towards more stable long term growth.""That is what the Bank thinks is the likely performance of the world economy over the next few years. But there are risks that could mean that it doesn't work out so well.That is reflected in the title of this year's report: ""Darkening Skies"".Some of the clouds are familiar ones.International commerce is already weakening, and conflict over trade especially between the US and China is one of the major risks.These are the two largest national economies on the planet. The Bank has calculated that 2.5% of global trade is affected by the new tariffs - trade taxes - that were imposed last year, and it would be double that if the further tariffs that have been discussed were implemented.The risk of rising protection remains high, the report says. It could depress economic activity in these two giant economies. Slower growth in China is particularly an issue for developing countries that export industrial commodities, energy and metals, as China is such a big buyer of these products.Franziska Ohnsorge says between them the US and China account for 20% of global trade and 40% of global GDP. If their economies are both hit she says, ""it's something that's felt all around [the world]"".The Bank does not expect a recession in either of these economies, though some commentators are now suggesting the US could be heading for one next year. But if it were to happen the risk of a global recession would increase sharply. In the past, the report says, the risk of a global recession in any one year was 7%. But if the US has a downturn, the probability goes up to 50%.Financial markets are also a risk. The chances of disorderly developments have increased. If interest rates are increased again in the US, or if the dollar gains sharply, it could have an impact on emerging and developing economies.Brexit appears in the Bank's assessment as a possible risk for countries that are especially reliant on selling to Europe. If the UK's exit takes place with no agreement there is a chance of significant economic damage to both the UK and the EU which could then affect countries in Eastern Europe and North Africa which are closely integrated with Europe.And even in the Bank's central, relatively optimistic, picture there are some depressing prospects for parts of the developing world - which is the group the World Bank exists to help.For about a third of countries concerned growth in per capita terms won't be enough to restart what the report calls ""the catch-up"" with the developed world, the narrowing of the gap between living standards.And in Sub-Saharan Africa per capita growth is likely to be less than 1%, insufficient to drive significant progress in alleviating poverty."
business	Wetherspoon boss attacks 'up the spout' City rules	'Tick-box malaise''No-deal Brexit'	"JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin says Britain's corporate governance rules are creating ""short-termism, inexperience and navel-gazing"".The pub chain boss said the system is ""up the spout - and is itself a threat to listed companies - and therefore to the UK economy"".He also said non-executive directors have too much power.It comes as investors are being urged to reject Wetherspoon's annual report over the firm's pro-Brexit spending.Shareholder advisory group Pirc wants investors to vote against the report at next week's annual meeting, prompting criticism from Mr Martin about the advisory group's structure and management.He makes his remarks in a trading update in which the chain he founded also posted like-for-like sales - which include comparable numbers of pubs - up 5.3% in the 13 weeks to 27 October.Mr Martin, who owns 32% of the pub chain, said there is a ""Noddy-in-Toyland"" aspect to the corporate governance codes used to police the boardrooms of companies listed on the London stock market.In his statement, he criticises the chain's largest City investor, Columbia Threadneedle, and US-based investors Blackrock for not supporting the company's non-executive directors at last year's annual meeting.This is because boardroom codes set out that non-executives should serve no more than nine years if they are to be regarded as ""independent"" from the day-to-day executive team.""I believe by vesting so much power in non-executive directors the system is also disenfranchising executives and the workforce - the people who have real expertise and are the cornerstone of business success,"" he says.At Wetherspoon's the average tenure of a non-executive is 15 years, while Mr Martin said he had served nine years by 1992.He attacked Pirc for recommending that shareholders vote against his re-election to the board, saying it is ""hypocritical"" as it only has one non-executive, not the four or five that is typical of a company.Mr Martin said the firms which enforce the rules - the shareholders and their advisors - do not follow the codes themselves.""The vast gap between the technocrats who make the rules and commercial reality is illustrated by the 2016 corporate governance code which refers to shareholders 64 times, employees three times and customers not at all,"" Mr Martin said,""A core problem is that corporate governance institutionalises short-termism, inexperience and navel-gazing,"" he said.He referred to a ""tick-box malaise"" which will lead to ""mediocrity or failure"". Mr Martin urges changes to the rules as companies will not want to list their shares in London.They might also kill the ""golden goose"" that is Wetherspoon, he said, paying about one pound in every thousand of UK taxes.Mr Martin, an outspoken supporter of Brexit who staged a nationwide tour to argue the case for the UK's departure from the EU, said that a no-deal Brexit was better for the UK economy than the government's plan.Wetherspoon's spent nearly £95,000 on pro-Leave beermats, posters and booklets during the 2016 referendum campaign.Mr Martin said the spending was declared to the Electoral Commission."
business	US economic growth slowest this year	Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondentRate cut?	"US economic growth slowed in the third quarter, but beat some economists' expectations of a bigger contraction.The Commerce Department data put GDP growth at 1.9% during the three months, ahead of the 1.6% predicted.Consumer spending held up better than expected, offsetting a fall in business investment and lower public spending.But the growth was still the slowest for 2019, and comes hours before the Federal Reserve is due to make its latest interest rate announcement.GDP growth in the previous quarter - the three months to end-June - was just below 2%. In 2018, the US economy grew by 3.4% in the third quarter.The Trump administration's trade war with China has eroded business confidence, while the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5tn tax cut package is also casting a shadow on the expansion.For many economists, the biggest worry about the US outlook is the trade conflict with China and others.The new figures did show some growth in exports after a marked decline in the previous three months. But it was pretty feeble growth.Imports, many of which are subject to additional tariffs as part of this trade conflict, were also higher, though again not strongly, after two quarters in which they failed to grow at all.So the figures do play into the story of trade as a continuing problem for US economic growth.All that said, it was still reasonable growth overall and more or less in line with many estimates of the economy's realistic potential.That means the economy couldn't really be expected to grow much faster for a sustained period.Wednesday's figures, suggesting resilient consumer spending and strong-than-expected housebuilding, is likely to ease fears that the US will enter recession.Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, slowed to a still-healthy 2.9% rate last quarter after surging at a 4.6% pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017. Consumer spending is being powered by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the growth figures ""could have been worse"" but the fourth quarter ""probably will be"".""Growth beat consensus mostly because consumption rose at a 2.9% rate.""We doubt that Q4 [the fourth quarter] will see such a solid increase in consumption, not least because the chainstore numbers indicate that people pulled forward spending after the 1 August announcement of tariffs on imported Chinese consumer goods. This boosted Q3 spending at the expense of Q4.""In a tweet on Wednesday before the growth figures were released, US President Donald Trump boasted of the ""Greatest Economy in American History"".But in 2012, when Barack Obama was president, he had warned that a 1.9% growth rate spelled ""deep trouble"".Ahead of the GDP figures, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said global growth is slowing and has had a modest impact on the US, adding the US economy remained strong with good capital inflows.""There is no question that the global economy is slowing down and that has had some modest drag on the US economy,"" he said at an investment conference in the Saudi Arabia capital Riyadh.Later on Wednesday, the US central bank was expected by many economists to wrap up its two-day policy meeting with an announcement of a cut in interest rates.""Nothing in today's report will surprise the Fed,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""The capital expenditure crunch stemming from the trade war will motivate a third rate cut. However, a still-sturdy consumer could give reason for pause at future meetings."""
business	US economy grows faster than expected	Analysis	"The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5% in the third quarter of the year, official figures have shown.The US Commerce Department said strong consumer and government spending helped to bolster the economy.But lower exports weighed on growth, after a surge earlier in the year as firms rushed shipments to beat tariffs.The 3.5% gain marked a slowdown from the 4.2% pace in the second quarter, but was better than the 3.3% expansion economists had predicted.""Growth downshifted a bit in Q3 and we look for some further slowing in the quarters ahead,"" analysts at Wells Fargo wrote.""That said, the US economy continues to grow in excess of the rate that most analysts consider to be its long-run potential growth rate.""The US economy is expected to grow at about 3% in 2018 - which would be the fastest rate in more than a decade.The pick-up comes as unemployment rates hover near record lows, and government policies, including a $1.5tr tax cut and expanded military budget, fuel spending.In the third quarter, consumer spending - which accounts for more than two thirds of output - grew at an annual rate of 4%. That was up from a rate of 3.8% recorded in the previous quarter.Overall, gross domestic product in the third quarter was up 3% compared to the same period in 2017.But the Commerce Department report also contained signs that the environment for growth may be weakening.Business investment increased at an annualised rate of less than 1%, while housing expenditures fell 4% - the third quarter in a row of contraction.Exports of goods also fell by 7% in the three months to 30 September, after spiking 13.5% in the prior period.The decline followed a wave of duties on American-made products that went into effect this summer, prompted by new US tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods.Kim Gittleson, New York business correspondentA truism of American politics has long been that what matters most to voters is the economy.If that's the case, this report will give Republicans much to cheer.Released just a little over a week before competitive midterm elections here, it gives President Trump's party yet another data point to use as they try to convince voters that they're responsible for the strongest economy in nearly a decade.In particular, one of the key drivers of economic activity has been American consumers, who increased their spending by 4% over the past quarter. That surprised many, but it indicates that low unemployment, increasing wages and lower taxes have all helped to encourage Americans to shop.The key question, of course, is if voters here believe that it is Republican policies that have powered this economic boom - and if that will be enough to help them keep control of Congress, even with a President whose divisive policies have turned this midterm election into more of a referendum on his personality instead of his party."
business	Cathay Pacific sells first-class tickets at economy rates again	A challenging year	"A group of lucky Cathay Pacific customers have scored first-class seats at economy prices, in the second fare blunder by the airline this month.Tickets on trips from Hong Kong to Portugal were sold on the airline's website for $1,512, instead of $16,000 usually charged for a similar journey.The carrier said it would honour the tickets as it investigates the cause of the error.It extends a recent run of blows to the firm including a huge data breach.The mispriced fares were available on Cathay Pacific's website on Sunday.First-class flights from Lisbon to Hong Kong - via London with a connecting flight - were offered for $1,512 (£1,177), according to the South China Morning Post.A similar first-class journey through Frankfurt would cost $16,000.In a statement, the Hong Kong carrier said it would honour the tickets.""We are looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors,"" it said.""For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services.""Just two weeks ago the airline made the same blunder.Lucky flyers made off with business-class seats on flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. They should have cost $16,000.At the time, the carrier acknowledged its ""mistake"" and again, said it would welcome the passengers onboard.Airlines have a mixed history of honouring tickets sold in error.Singapore Airlines, for example, honoured tickets sold for less than half price in 2014. But United Airlines cancelled transatlantic tickets sold for less than $100 by a ""third party software provider"" the following year.The latest stumble extends a bad run for Cathay Pacific.In October, the firm was the subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers.A month earlier, it had to send one of its planes back to the paint shop after spelling the airline's name ""Cathay Paciic"" on the side of a jet.Those missteps come as the airline tries to return to profitability after posting its first ever back-to-back annual loss in March.Cathay Pacific has struggled against competition, particularly from low-cost Chinese carriers covering Hong Kong, mainland China and South East Asia."
business	Branson apologises for South Africa launch tweet		"Sir Richard Branson has apologised for a photo he used to mark the launch his new Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship in South Africa.The entrepreneur tweeted a photo which was criticised for failing to reflect the diversity of South Africa.One of the critics is South African fashion designer Thula Sindi, who says: ""Where did you find so many white people in South Africa?""Sir Richard tweeted an apology, saying it ""clearly lacked diversity"".A Virgin Group spokesperson added the image in Sir Richard's tweet did not reflect ""the diverse make-up of attendees"" at the launch event.In the intial tweet, Sir Richard said: ""Wonderful to be in South Africa to help launch the new Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. We aim to become the heart of entrepreneurship for Southern Africa.""It sparked a series of responses, including from Mr Sindi - whose designs were worn by South Africa's minister of communications and telecommunications, Stella Ndabeni-Abraham on the day she was sworn in.He remarks that it must have ""Really taken an honest effort for exclude the majority of the population which is just as skilled and talented"".Sir Richard later tweeted: ""Apologies. I hope you will take a look at my blog which does far better justice to the amazing work of the Centre and its team.""In the link to his blog, Sir Richard writes: ""We will play a more meaningful role in entrepreneurs' lives than your average accelerator, supporting companies to not just survive, but thrive, and make business a real force for good in society, for the environment and the economy.""One individual had told critics they were wrong. ""This is one of many pictures, most of which are diverse,"" he tweeted.South Africa's population of almost 58 million is 80% black African, and Sir Richard writes in his blog that the ""economy is dependent on entrepreneurial activity for creating future economic growth and jobs"".""But the economic contribution to South Africa's entrepreneurial sector is below the developing country norm. I believe that increasing entrepreneurship in this country is the golden highway to economic democracy,"" he adds.Sir Richard's Virgin Group has a wide range of interests from gyms to planes and the entrepreneur's space company, Virgin Galactic, listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month.A spokesperson for Virgin said: ""The tweet linked to a blog about the launch of the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship South Africa, which assists aspiring entrepreneurs of all backgrounds with the skills, opportunities and inspiration they need to succeed.""We apologise for the poorly chosen image, but would like to emphasise that this does not reflect the diverse make-up of attendees.""As the video, other social posts and other images of the event show, many of the diverse group of Branson Centre entrepreneurs, trustees and team were present and the image attached to that particular tweet should have reflected this too."""
business	IMF: 'Dangerous undercurrents' threaten global economy	ComplacentContagion risk	"One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy.The International Monetary Fund's Financial Stability Report says that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks.Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen.Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"".Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues.The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently.The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required.In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did.Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said.That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy.The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance.On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers.Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again.President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses.The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history.The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system.One could be the ending of ""easy money"".Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis.Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back.The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets.The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted.""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says.""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises.""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions.""The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last.The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar.To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher.That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors.The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating.The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income.That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis."
business	Euro falls as 'gilets jaunes' protests hit French economy		"The euro has fallen against the dollar after disappointing French and German economic surveys dismayed the markets.In France, private sector business activity contracted for the first time in two and a half years as the ""gilets jaunes"" protests took their toll.In Germany, private sector activity slowed to a four-year low. The surveys pointed to weak fourth-quarter growth in the two biggest eurozone economies.After the figures were published, the euro fell 0.6% to below the $1.13 mark.The data came from closely-watched surveys published by research group IHS Markit, which tracks business activity across Europe in its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).Its December composite figure for the French economy was down sharply at 49.3, from November's reading of 54.2.Any figure below 50 indicates contraction rather than expansion. The French reading confounded analysts, with the index hitting depths not seen since November 2014.""Having held up reasonably well throughout the initial months of Q4, latest flash data pointed to an outright contraction in France's private sector for the first time in two-and-a-half years, following the protests which have swept through the country in recent weeks,"" said Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit.""Momentum in the manufacturing sector's downturn gathered pace, while most notably, the service sector's resilience came to a halt, with business activity and demand dropping.""For the German economy, the equivalent figure was 52.2, as against 52.3 the previous month.The impact of the ""yellow vest"" demonstrations has been keenly felt in France, where the government has been forced to bow to pressure and change its economic course.President Emmanuel Macron has responded to the nationwide street protests by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise and promising an extra €100 (£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.However, it is far from clear that he has done enough to defuse public anger.Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, said: ""The sentiments among the yellow vests may have quite some support from the French public. However, businesses beg to disagree.""If the magnitude of this drop continues in other countries and coming months, the European Central Bank's assessment that the eurozone economy 'risks moving to the downside' will quickly seem outdated, as the risks will already be there.""The ECB president talked yesterday of 'lower growth, not of no growth'. However, a tail risk is forming that eurozone economies will slip into a recession while the ECB interest rates are still sub-zero.""This would be a Japan-like scenario: a prospect which the euro understandably does not take well."""
business	Italy's economy stalls as eurozone slows down	Waning optimism	"Italy's economy came to a standstill in the third quarter of the year, registering no growth at all.It comes as the new coalition government is arguing with the European Commission over the need for an expansionary budget to boost growth.Meanwhile, figures from the European Union showed economic growth in the 19 countries using the euro currency slowed by more than expected.Eurozone growth slowed to 0.2%, from 0.4% in the previous quarter.Growth across all 28 countries of the EU fell to 0.3% from 0.5%.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the zero growth in Italy justified Rome's expansionary 2019 budget, which the European Commission has rejected because it breaks EU rules.He said on Facebook; ""The slowing GDP is another reason to go full steam ahead with the budget.""Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""This is a sobering number for the new government, though we suspect that it will meet it with fighting talk, at least initially.""After all, with growth now stalling, fiscal stimulus is needed more than ever, or so at least the argument will go in Rome.""Figures from the French statistics agency INSEE showed France's economy picked up thanks to a rebound in consumer spending.It grew by 0.4% in the third quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three-month period, but the rate was less than forecast, meaning the government may miss its full-year growth targets.Separately, the European Commission said economic sentiment dropped in the eurozone for the 10th consecutive month.Its measure of sentiment fell to 109.8 points in October from 110.9 in September - the biggest drop since March."
business	Is surge pricing a fair way to manage demand?	More things that made the modern economy:	"In the 1950s, the New York subway faced a problem that will be familiar to users of public transport all over the world.At peak times, it was overcrowded; at other times, the trains were empty.The mayor commissioned a report, which concluded the problem was subway riders paid a flat fare. No matter where you boarded, how far you travelled, or when you made your trip, it would cost you 10 cents.Might there be some more sophisticated approach? Perhaps so. The report's foreword singled out a proposal from one of the 17 authors, economist William Vickrey.""The abandonment of the flat-rate fare in favour of a fare structure which takes into account the length and location of the ride and the hour of the day is obviously a sensible step provided the mechanical problems involved can be solved,"" he said.Vickrey's basic idea was simple: when the trains were busy, charge more. When they were quiet, charge less.The peaks in demand would become less spiky. The subway would be more comfortable and reliable, could carry more people without having to build new lines, and could raise more money, all at once. A great idea.But how to charge all these different prices? Not with an army of ticket clerks and inspectors; that would take too much time and money, so an automated solution must be found.What was needed was a coin-operated turnstile that could charge different rates for different journeys at different times. But this was not easy to deliver in 1952.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.To give a sense of the scale of the challenge for William Vickrey, consider a dilemma faced by the Coca-Cola company. A Coke had cost a nickel - five cents - for decades.Coca-Cola would have liked to increase the price by a cent or two but it couldn't.Why? Its 400,000 vending machines took only nickels and redesigning them to take two different denominations of coin would be a logistical nightmare.In 1953, Coca-Cola tried instead to persuade President Eisenhower - in all seriousness - to introduce a 7.5 cent coin. That attempt failed - and Coca-Cola's price remained five cents until 1959.But Vickrey wasn't daunted and described a contraption that would solve the problem.""Passengers put a quarter in the entrance turnstile, get a metal check with notches indicating the zone of origin to be inserted in an exit turnstile, which would, through electro-mechanical relays, deliver an appropriate number of nickels according to the origin and time of day,"" he said.It sounds clever, so you may be wondering why you haven't heard of it.One clue comes from the title of the speech in which Vickrey gave that description, My Innovative Failures In Economics. He began that speech by saying: ""You are looking at an economist who has repeatedly failed in achieving his objective.""The variable-price electromechanical Vickrey Turnstile was never built.So why are you reading an article about a non-existent invention? It's because the idea itself was so important, even if it was initially too complicated to be put into practice.Vickrey's fellow economists often said he was just too far ahead of his time. He eventually won a Nobel Memorial Prize for his work, in 1996, just three days before his death.Vickrey was proposing what is often called ""peak load pricing"" by economists, and ""dynamic pricing"" by management consultants.In its simplest form, it's an old idea. ""Early bird specials"" - offering a cheap deal to restaurant diners at quiet times - date back to the 1920s. It's an easy sell to customers and requires no electromechanical wizardry.But the idea has appeal in far more complex settings.Whether you're running a subway system or an airline, trying to fill a concert hall or balance an electricity grid, it can be very costly to add extra capacity just to meet a short-term peak in demand - and it is wasteful to carry unused capacity around at other times. Varying prices make sense.US Airlines was an early pioneer of the idea, after deregulation meant the company had to compete fiercely in the late 1970s. By 1984, the Wall Street Journal reported Delta Air Lines alone employed 147 staff to incessantly tweak prices.Peak-load pricing no longer requires an army of pricing specialists. A company such as Uber can effortlessly match supply and demand with an algorithm. Uber's ""surge pricing"" promises to end that painful three-hour wait for a taxi on New Year's Eve; there's always a price for a car right now.But consumer acceptance may be more of a problem. ""You're almost at their mercy because you don't want to wait longer for a cab,"" one disgruntled customer told the Houston Chronicle after being charged $247.50 (£203) for a 21km (13-mile) ride in Houston, Texas. Although, it's worth pointing out he chose to pay so much because he couldn't bear to wait for a cheaper journey.Consumers can feel exploited by some forms of dynamic pricing - especially when, as with Uber, prices can double or halve in a matter of minutes.A 1986 study by behavioural scientists Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch and Richard Thaler indicated people found price surges infuriating.Having once despaired over the lack of a 7.5 cent coin, Coca-Cola unsuccessfully attempted another technological solution in 1999, when it flirted with a vending machine that on sweltering days would raise the price of an ice-cold Coke. It was so unpopular, the company had to backtrack.But peak-load pricing is likely to play an increasing role in the economy of the future.Consider a smart electricity grid fed by intermittent power sources such as wind and solar power. When a cloud covers the Sun, your laptop might decide to stop charging, your freezer might switch itself off for a minute, or your electric car might even start pumping energy into the grid rather than sucking it out.But all that would require those devices to respond to second-by-second price changes.William Vickrey was also fascinated by the possibilities offered by congestion pricing on roads, designed - just as his turnstile was - to smooth out demand and ensure limited capacity was used well.That's now becoming a reality. Drivers in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, can switch into a free-flowing lane on Interstate 66 during rush hour if they're willing to pay the variable charge, which can be as much as $40 (£33) for 15km when traffic is particularly bad.Vickrey had tried to show this idea could work, in the mid-1960s: he built a prototype, using a simple computer and a radio-transmitter to tally every time he used his own driveway.But as with the turnstile, sometimes good ideas just need to wait for the technology to catch up.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	UK economy's fate is held in the hands of the shopper	AnxietyBrexit rebound?Dismal investment	"Like it or loathe it, the consumer is king - or even, queen - and no more so than over Christmas.The spike in festive spending between November and January typically makes up 40% of a retailer's takings.For many, the season's tidings weren't particularly cheerful (if not perhaps as bleak as some feared). The amount ringing through tills is crucial to their survival - and that of the High Street.Yet it has a far wider significance.Add in spending on services - from haircuts to day trips - and households' outlays make up two-thirds of GDP, the driver of growth in recent years.But strip out the seasonal noise - the turkey and present-buying frenzy, the browsing of the Boxing Day sales, be it online or in stores - and one thing is clear: the underlying trend is spending is slowing down, as the official number-crunchers at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have confirmed.Back as the heady days of summer, when retailers were still designing their Christmas ranges, the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, warned that a slowing of consumer activity may be on the cards.Just before heading off to hang up their stockings for Christmas, the members of the Bank's interest-rate setting panel confirmed it was seeing signs of a slowdown in retail sales, and claimed that ""Brexit-related uncertainty"" was weighing on the economy.Certainly, the prolonged anxiety appears to have dented sentiment, with the respected GFK survey reporting that consumer confidence is at its lowest level for five years.Why so glum? The prolonged uncertainty about post-Brexit arrangements, coupled with the mounting warnings about the impact of a no-deal on everything from prices to jobs, may justify caution.And these come against the backdrop of that lost decade for incomes. Strip out changes in the cost of living and wages are lower than prior to the financial crisis, on average. In other words, we're worse off than a decade ago.Then there's slowing house price growth and a weaker housing market, both of which affect how well-off we feel.But are sentiment surveys overdoing the gloom? While the sales reports from our biggest retailers didn't make for cheerful reading, they could have been worse.There does appear to be some disconnect between sentiment and reality. Indeed, the squeeze on real incomes is now being eased - albeit gradually.Earnings on average grew at their fastest rate in November for a decade, helping to recoup a bit of the lost ground.Bear in mind that employment is at record levels, and that bodes well for a rebound in both sentiment and spending if and when there is greater certainty about the post-Brexit landscape: a household-funded deal dividend.It's not just about what the arrangements are, but how consumers respond to those.That would ease the pressure on a beleaguered sector. Retailers are facing not only intense cost pressures, from wages to business rates, but also changing shopping habits.For the first time, more than a fifth of shopping in November was carried out online, according to the ONS.It's sink or swim for retailers as they try to keep up. As the list of casualties grows, more than 60,000 jobs disappeared from the sector encompassing retail between June 2017 and September 2018.In a month's time, we'll discover how the economy fared in 2018.Add dismal investment and lower public spending to a more hesitant consumer and GDP is likely to have suffered its weakest year for growth since the crisis.The same factors are likely to mean a sluggish start to 2019. What happens next depends as much on consumers as politicians: it's literally in our hands."
business	German economy contracts for first time since 2015	'Downward trend'	"Germany's economy contracted in the third quarter of the year, dented by weaker exports, figures have shown.Europe's largest economy shrank by 0.2% between July and September, as global trade disputes had a knock-on effect for Europe's largest economy.It was the economy's first quarter-on-quarter fall since 2015.Meanwhile, the eurozone economy as a whole grew at its slowest rate for four years in the third quarter, the European statistics agency confirmed.Germany's economy grew by 1.1% from July to September, compared with the same quarter of the previous year, the Federal Statistics Office said.""The slight decline in GDP compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to foreign trade developments: provisional calculations show there were fewer exports, but more imports in the third quarter than in the second,"" the Destatis office said.""According to provisional calculations, exports were down while imports were up in the third quarter of 2018, compared with the second quarter of the year.""As regards domestic demand, there were mixed signals. While gross fixed capital formation both in machinery and equipment and in construction was higher than in the previous quarter, final consumption expenditure of households declined.""On Tuesday, the ZEW research institute said that investors did not expect the German economy to recover rapidly from the third-quarter weakness.The German government had flagged up potential bottlenecks in the car industry last month, stemming from the introduction of new pollution standards, as an economic factor.One economist said that while there were positive signs on the horizon for Germany, issues remained around exports.""Both exports and consumer spending could rebound in the coming quarters as car producers make up for lost time and car spending increases accordingly,"" said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics.""More fundamentally, the high level of consumer confidence, rising wage growth and the likelihood of a marked fall in inflation all point to a pick-up in spending growth ahead.""But export growth will remain on a downward trend as global demand softens further.""She added that it looked as though the German economy would grow by about 1.5% this year, rather than a previous estimate of 1.8%.The 19-nation eurozone saw its gross domestic product (GDP) rise by 0.2% between July and September, according to Eurostat.The economy of France grew by 0.4% in the third quarter, while Italy's was flat.Year-on-year the eurozone grew by 1.7%, the slowest pace since the final three months of 2014."
business	Why does Labour want to give away free broadband?		"Whereas Margaret Thatcher recast the privatisations of the 1980s into share giveaways that popularised mass participation capitalism to some voters, this Labour move seeks to do the exact reverse, nearly four decades on.It is an attempt to turn state ownership into an election-friendly retail policy: free broadband for all.It is really two policies in one. The theory behind nationalisation has traditionally been about industrial policy - the government taking a view on the strategic direction of the economy.This move is more than that - shifting the state into the provision of what is known as ""universal basic services"". Formerly thought of as health and education, now Labour wants to add broadband too.Since the early 1980s, even before BT was privatised, and the internet existed, Labour politicians have argued for a national Government roll out of fibre optic connections.The UK led the world in this technology, but it was not quickly commercialised here, partly because successive Governments chose to prioritise competition from slow copper cables, and we now lag behind many countries.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is seeking to correct this by running fibre broadband provision from Government by buying parts of BT. Under his new approach to borrowing such a transaction would not affect the public finances - the billions in extra borrowing would be offset by the value of the asset - the new British Broadband company.Other countries such as South Korea or Portugal were similarly statist but still relied on the private sector telecoms companies to deliver the plans.Mr McDonnell believes this would be a massive subsidy to the private sector, hence the part-renationalisation of BT.This state control of the telecom's backend infrastructure is not even the really radical part of his policy.Insisting that the consumer provision of broadband is both state-owned, and free, is, very radical, and unproven.Essentially Labour has taken an industrial policy of the state providing the digital infrastructure of the future, and layered on top of it marketing free broadband for all to voters.It's an attempt to meld populism to statism, but it relies on voters giving even more trust in politicians, at a time where there seems to be very little."
business	Hot summer gives boost to UK economy	Analysis:	"The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to August, buoyed by the hot summer, the Office for National Statistics said.But the ONS said that in August, GDP growth was flat. Economists had predicted 0.1% growth.The three-month measure was the fastest pace of growth since February 2017, economists said.The ONS's head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, said the economy had ""continued to rebound strongly after a weak spring"".He said retail, food and drink production and house building had all performed particularly well during the hot summer months.""However, long-term growth continues to lag behind its historical trend,"" Mr Kent-Smith added.The ONS has introduced monthly measures of GDP and provides three-month rolling growth figures, rather than the quarterly figures it published in the past.Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economists, said the three-month 0.7% figure was higher than the 0.6% expected because of upward revisions to earlier data.Data last month had shown the economy grew by 0.3% in July. The latest figures revised this up to 0.4% and the figure for June was also revised upwards.""Rolling three-month growth in the services and construction sectors eased compared to July, but this was offset by industrial production recovering from its recent contraction,"" Mr Wishart said.By Simon Jack, BBC business editorA three month growth rate of 0.7% looks pretty darn good for an economy generally forecast to grow somewhere between 1% and 1.5% for the whole year.But as always, there is some salt to be pinched.The three-month figure continues to be flattered by a strong showing from construction in June and July, caused by a bounce-back in activity after a weather-affected beginning of the year.Next month, June's strong performance from production, construction and manufacturing will drop out of the rolling three-month calculation.The figures also show that the UK economy did not grow at all in August.Now that is not the end of the world, as it means the economy didn't shrink after a strong June and July.In summary, it looks like the UK economy is on track to record a pretty good third quarter, but there will be no sound of corks popping in the Treasury.The ONS said that growth was picking up from April, when data for the first quarter of the year was showing the weakest growth since 2012, only partly because of the cold weather.The UK then had a heatwave, which the ONS has said helped to fuel growth in the retail sector.Taking a longer-term view, the ONS said growth in the services sector - which makes up 80% of the economy - was subdued when compared with the same three months a year earlier.According to the ONS:Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: ""The main takeaway from today's bumper crop of releases on the economy is that the UK saw a spurt of activity in June and July not seen since the end of 2016. Beyond that, it seems that it's back to business as usual more or less in August.""The underlying services picture looks to be slow and steady, the construction sector has recovered its weather-related losses from earlier in the year and manufacturing weakness is persisting in the second half of this year so far,"" Ms Hopley said.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the economy was on track for an annual growth rate of 1.5%. ""This is somewhat below its longer-term trend rate of around 2% and reflects the continued drag on business investment, in particular from Brexit-related uncertainty,"" he said."
business	My Money: 'Three months of fuel costs £400'	Caroline's week: A nervous wait for an MOT result, and a comforting mug of hot chocolateHow does Caroline feel about her week?Total weekly spend: £451.51	"My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Caroline Thurston from Oxford records her spending over a week and shares tips for saving.We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (UK) Facebook group, or, if you don't live in the UK, please join our My Money (World) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.Caroline is 33 and works in higher education. She lives on a narrowboat, which she bought three years ago with an unsecured personal loan, which she repays at £705.42 per month. The boat is moored on a permanent residential mooring, for which Caroline pays £257.44 per month in mooring and boat licence fees.In her spare time, when she's not doing ""boat jobs"" she runs a Guides unit in her village, and enjoys cooking Greek food. Over to Caroline.It's a grey, drizzly day, and the fire went out overnight. In the winter I tread a fine line between keeping the boat at a comfortable temperature, and inadvertently draining the batteries by running the heating pump continuously. A gravity-fed heating system which doesn't use an electric-powered pump would be more efficient but the upfront cost is beyond my budget at the moment.People assume that living on a boat is cheaper than living in a house, but it's not - you just spend your money in a different way. Ask a boater what ""boat"" stands for and they'll tell you 'bring out another thousand'. And then they'll laugh, and probably weep a bit too.Oxford is a cycling city (true according to sheer numbers, arguably untrue based on the lack of cycling infrastructure). I cycle to work every day so my commute is free.I'm nearly out of contact lens solution, so I re-order three months' supply online (£17.00) through Amazon Smile, which ensures a donation goes to the RSPCA. I also re-order three months' worth of contact lenses (£35.77).The weather is so grim that I cycle straight home and batten down the hatches. My solar panel hasn't generated much power today, so I run the generator for a few hours to boost the batteries. I need more efficient solar panels, as they will significantly offset my expenditure on petrol for the generator, and diesel for the boat engine (around £8 per week in total), but my current top priority is ordering coal for the winter.Usually I buy enough for a month at a time, but this winter there will be a stoppage (canal closure) at a bridge just north of my mooring, meaning that Dusty the fuel boat will be unable to get through for three months. Ordering three months' worth of fuel in advance is a pricey business, and will set me back around £400-500 on top of my usual monthly bills. So, no new solar panels just yet.Total spend: £52.77Morale is low at work today, so I buy hot chocolates for me and a colleague (£3.40). After work I drop my car off at the garage for its MOT and say a silent prayer. The car is a 2003 Vauxhall Corsa which I bought two years ago from a colleague of my stepmother's and paid for in instalments.Owning a car is probably as close as I get to ""a luxury"", but it improves my life immeasurably. It helps me stay connected to friends and family, and has brought down my food costs significantly, by enabling me to do my food shopping at the big out-of-city supermarkets.I spend around £30 a week on food. I plan my meals, and always take my own lunch to work. I lived and worked in Greece for a few years, so I love cooking Greek food. A lot of Greek cuisine is inherently cheap (and tasty!). I make this lentil dish regularly, which is based on a type of lentil soup (fakēs).On Tuesday nights I run a Guides unit in my village. I was really pleased to see that Girlguiding included financial literacy as part of the ""skills for my future"" theme, running across all ages in their revamped programme, which launched a year ago. Tonight though we have a rather soggy and chaotic game of Capture the Flag on the village green.Total spend: £3.40D-day. Will my car make it through the MOT? The mechanic calls me mid-morning with the welcome news that, aside from a pair of new tyres and a recommended oil-and-filter change, the car is fine. I pay £296.85, transferring money out of my (very tiny) savings pot. I will put the money back in at the end of the month once I'm paid.Today I also receive a notification that my monthly Geocaching (an outdoor treasure-hunting game) subscription has been paid (£4.63). On the way home I stop at the post office to return my high-viz cycling jacket to the supplier, as the zip has broken. It's under warranty so the repair or replacement is free, but the postage costs me £8.70.Total spend: £310.18I have a meeting with a colleague today, but as all the meeting rooms in the building are booked we go to the university cafe next door and I buy the coffees (£3.30), which I'll claim back as work-related expenditure. Our office doesn't operate a petty cash system, so all expenses have to be incurred personally and then claimed back, which I think assumes too much about the financial situations of its employees.Two years ago I acquired a £4,000 overdraft debt overnight (due to the Canal and River Trust omitting the VAT on my mooring fees and threatening me with a CCJ [county court judgement] unless I paid the VAT bill in full immediately) and I have been in the debt trap ever since. I recently consolidated my bank loan and overdraft, and my credit rating plummeted as a result.I have been using my credit card for the last year or so with great diligence in an attempt to improve my credit score. I never put more on it than I know I can afford, and I always clear the balance at the end of every month. Nonetheless, the interest rate went up when my credit rating went down, which is incredibly disheartening.The poverty premium is very real, and can affect anyone, no matter how ""middle-class"" they may seem. Debt - and its impact on a person's mental health - is still a taboo subject. During the six-month process of consolidating my debts, I was very grateful for the support of a good friend who advises the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. I am now part of MMHPI's research community, offering ""lived experience"" expertise and input to their work.Total spend: £3.30Dusty the fuel boat will be out for delivery next week, so I place an order via text for 15 bags of coal, two bags of kindling, and a bottle of gas, which in total will set me back £231.My fuel costs are - unsurprisingly - weighted heavily towards the winter months, and every year I tell myself I'll set aside money during the summer. But I never seem to have enough disposable income to do it.In the winter I burn around 50-60kg (£25-£30 worth) of smokeless fuel a week. A bottle of gas (£33) will last three months. I burn wood for heating too - it's useful to raise the temperature of the boat quickly, but it's not possible to keep the stove going overnight using just wood. Keeping warm isn't just a consideration of comfort - it also prevents damp and condensation, which would otherwise damage the fabric of the boat.My neighbour has invited me for dinner this evening. On the way I stop at Sainsbury's to buy food shopping for next week (£34.34, including wine and chocolate for my hosts tonight and tomorrow) and to fill the car with petrol (£32.02, including a five-litre jerrycan for my generator).Total spend: £66.36I'm off to London to see my best friend. We haven't seen each other in five months, so we have a lot to catch up on! I would usually get the train to London, but there are engineering works this weekend and I don't fancy a three-hour schlep from Oxford to Upton Park, so I drive. In the afternoon we go for a long walk along the Greenway footpath in east London, then catch the bus back to her home (£1.50).Total spend: £1.50I am greeted on my arrival back in Oxford by a large pile of firewood outside my boat. In a bid to economise, five of us have pitched in for delivery of a tonne of wood, which my amazing neighbours have - in my absence - already distributed to all the boats. My share costs £14, but I also promise to buy the log-movers a drink at next month's boaters' drinks at our local pub.I spend the afternoon dutifully carrying out my weekly ""boat jobs"" - filling the water tank, stacking the log store, emptying the toilet, sweeping out the stove, pumping out the engine bay, and tightening the stern gland. Oh the glamour of it all! I also harvest the last of my tomatoes and peas, grown by our community-run gardening project in raised beds on the towpath, and make tomato and basil soup for dinner.Total spend: £14With the exception of my MOT, it was a pretty typical week - there were no great surprises! It's encouraging to see that, as I suspected, my outgoings are on the essentials I need to stay warm, dry and fed. Unless I get rid of my car, I can't see how I'd pare back this week's spending.I think I am a long way off from having sufficient disposable income to build up any substantial savings. Maybe some better solar panels are in reach, though!"
business	Westpac bank 'breached anti-money laundering laws'	Banks under pressure	"Australia's financial crime watchdog has accused Westpac bank of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) said each breach carries a maximum a penalty of A$21m ($7.5m; £11m).Westpac, the country's second largest bank, said the issues ""should never have occurred"".It is the second top Australian bank to face huge fines for breaching the laws.Most of the breaches concern a failure to report international transfers to Austrac in a timely manner.Westpac allegedly failed to properly report more than 19.5 million international funds transfers between 2013 and 2018.Austrac Chief Executive Nicole Rose said Westpac's failure to properly report the transfers undermined ""the integrity of Australia's financial system"" and ""hindered its ability to track down the origins of financial transactions, when required to support police investigations"".The unreported transactions amounted to more than A$11bn over a period of up to six years, Austrac said.The bank also allegedly failed to retain records and perform certain due diligence functions with potentially high-risk overseas banks.Those banks all disclosed relationships with high-risk or sanctioned countries, including Iraq, Ukraine and Zimbabwe.""The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac,"" Austrac said in its statement.The agency also said there were a small number of transactions on accounts that were potentially linked to ""child exploitation risks"".It argued Westpac failed to implement the necessary automated detection procedures on these transactions.Westpac's shares sank 3.3% in Sydney trading.Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said the issues ""should have been identified and rectified sooner"".""It is disappointing that we have not met our own standards as well as regulatory expectations and requirements,"" he said in a statement.The bank said it had self-reported the potential breaches to Austrac, and had previously disclosed the investigation to shareholders in its annual results.Westpac's competitor Commonwealth Bank paid an A$700m fine for similar breaches last year.The country's banking sector has also been the subject of a royal commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - that earlier this year exposed widespread wrongdoing in the industry."
business	My Money: 'I used the same nappy for my nine children'	Katie's week: Chinese medicine, bike frames, pigeon food and stewHow does Katie feel about her week?Total weekly spend: £510.99	"My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they make. Here, Katie Holden from Bradford, records her spending over a week, and shares tips for saving which is especially important because she has nine children.We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.Katie is a home-schooling mother of nine children. The eldest two are studying A-Levels at college and the youngest is a toddler. Her husband is a maths teacher who also runs a rental business for extra income. Her family is obsessed with road cycling and last summer one of her sons won a local triathlon.She has used cloth nappies for all of her nine children: ""They still work just fine, incidentally, and have saved us a bonny penny over the years.""She also says she has three wonderful cats and also keeps ""too many"" pigeons, rabbits, quails and gerbils. She likes to crochet, grow vegetables and go camping.To start the week I made a vast pot of stew, which my 15-year-old son later honours with the accolade of being ""half decent."" Feeling dizzy with joy on hearing such extravagant praise, I feel it is only fair to share the recipe with a world undoubtedly breathless with anticipation.£5.89The price of a budget, healthy meal for 11£2Yoghurt£1.89Red lentils50pOnions50pCarrots£1Frozen peasMethod1. Fry three chopped onions, five garlic cloves, five grated carrots and one huge grated marrow-type thing (homegrown so I'm not sure what it is exactly) in coconut oil until the juices have evaporated and the vegetables are browning.2. Add a large serving spoon of ras el hanout (cheapest source is the internet) and a teaspoon of turmeric (from an Asian supermarket), three tins of chopped tomatoes, 1.5 litres of home-made chicken stock and 1 kg of dry red split lentils. When the mix is boiling, reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the lentils are cooked (at least an hour). Stir occasionally to prevent the lentils sticking and burning.3. Add any chopped green vegetables to hand (today this means frozen peas), season with salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables are done. Put some aside for the freezer and keep the rest for the week ahead.4. Serve with rice and yoghurt containing chopped, fresh coriander.Here I am with six of my children. The oldest four didn't want to be photographed.Total spend: £5.89I top up my mobile with £10 today, sending my balance rocketing to a whopping £11.36. I can afford this reckless spending spree because (wait for it) Etsy have refunded me £92 for a non-existent picture I paid for two months ago. Actually, I paid £102 for this myth when you include tax, so have lost £10 for two months of owning nothing but a beautiful dream...I defrost the freezer and start making stock with all the sheep bones and trotters that were lost in its icy depths. Our local butcher sells bones really, really cheap and gives us left over chicken bones for free. They make fantastic stock and the cats eat any leftover scraps of meat.Recipe for stock1. Put bones and any vegetable scraps in a pan.2. Cover with water and once it has boiled, cover and simmer on a very low heat for hours and hours and hours to get the nutrients out of the bones.Before and after pictures of bone stock:When I take the car out in the evening it has the deep, distinctive roar of a knackered exhaust pipe which really needs replacing. Something else that will cost money to fix!Total spend: £10Total gained: £92A blessedly cheap home-schooling day today. After the morning's maths lessons I cut my seven-year-old son's hair (£0 - oh how good it feels to not spend money!). The kids carve three pumpkins (£2 per pumpkin). We put the pumpkin seeds on a tray to dry out for our pet gerbils and rabbits to eat and I boil the flesh for soup.All in all, home-schooling is one of our most expensive lifestyle choices. Each GCSE our children take costs £500 - £1,000 in exam fees, workbooks, tutors, textbooks, revision guides etc. This is on top of the costs needed to get the children through their primary years and funding the numerous projects and hobbies they've acquired. The greatest cost, however, is that I am not at work, investing in a career and earning money. On the plus side it is rewarding work and I am convinced the advantages to our children in terms of their personal freedoms and independence make home-schooling worth it (most of the time, anyway).I put £10 on the new Sim card I bought for my 16-year old's phone. This means we've lost the £2.52 he had on his old Sim, which O2 had said they'd reimburse, but failed to do. I can't be bothered with the effort of chasing down the £2.52, to be honest.As the weather has started to turn, I light a fire in the evening. This works out free as we salvage wood and leave it to dry outside over the summer. Here's a picture…Total spend: £16Today we are expecting guests, another home-schooling family, for lunch. I nip to our local Aldi with my nine-year old and buy £9.19 worth of salad and cheese for lunch (jacket potatoes with salad). We pop into the post office to send my daughters' pen friend a parcel containing a painted stone they are convinced is a dinosaur tooth, although I have my doubts. I also spend 61p on a second class stamp and buy a game from our local charity shop for £2.On returning home I have a heated exchange of words with my 15-year old when I ask him to go back to the shops I've just been to so he can buy the tins of sweetcorn I clean forgot to get three minutes ago. He mumbles darkly about shopping lists and their uses until, amazingly, my 16-year-old son volunteers to go. I give him £5. He returns with two extremely cheap tins of corn and says he needs to keep the change for college.I make apple crumble with apples from the garden for pudding (the roses are a gift from our guests).Total spend: £16.80With a large family we are constantly choosing how and where it is best to spend our money. We save a lot by cooking from scratch and avoiding processed foods (which are expensive and unsatisfying) and most of our things we buy second hand. We scour the internet for bulk-buy bargains to reduce our grocery bill and use our possessions until they break, fall apart or disintegrate.However, I do not want our children to grow up feeling deprived or resenting our totally unfashionable, low-tech, penny-pinching ways. When I do splash out I want it to be on worthwhile experiences; real things that make memories. This is my roundabout way of justifying the £110.42 I paid today to enter a cycling sportive. My husband is going on the shortest route with four children, whilst our eldest three children are doing ""the monster"" which is over 93 miles.When my husband comes home he is elated to tell me the head teacher of his school took him to one side, thanked him for all of his hard work and promised he would ask the governors to give him a pay rise. He doubts this will actually result in a pay rise as the school has no money, but there's always a chance.We ate leftovers for lunch so spent nowt on food.Total spend: £110.42I have always wondered why, despite having five dehumidifiers in the house, there is a persistent patch of damp on my bedroom wall. Last night's storm revealed a leak directly above said wall. The steady drip of water kept me awake but the rhythmic tapping apparently helped my husband get back to sleep. I look about 100 years old in the morning. The roof will need fixing which is other expense lying in wait for us.Seven of our children begin the day by going for a bike ride. Unfortunately, our eldest son has noticed his bike frame is cracking around the rear brake and this leaves him with the options of:1. Racing through Yorkshire's stunningly beautiful, steep hills with reduced braking ability (his suggestion, not mine).2. Buying another second-hand racing bike.3. Buying a second-hand carbon frame (we agree this is best).He finds an okay frame on eBay, bidding ends tomorrow and currently stands at £41.I take three of our children for swimming lessons every weekend. Although this is a significant cost (£25.50 per week for three children) it is worth every penny.I buy pigeon food (£31.50 for 60kg). I would personally like to re-home half our pigeons and halve the expense of this particular hobby, but my sensible suggestion was met with mutiny and tears, so the birds are staying and I'm still paying.Here is my daughter feeding a pigeon chick.The last great expense of the day is borne by my husband who goes with our son for Chinese medicine. It costs £150 for five treatments. They come back with some herbs (for making tea).Total spend: £207I do the main grocery shop of the week, online, and spend £94.34. I have thoroughly explored all the options for our main, weekly shop, from driving between shops to hunt down the cheapest groceries, to comparing all the delivery options from the major supermarkets. My honest conclusion is that there aren't truly astounding savings to be had when you weigh up the marginal differences in price against the quality of food and convenience to the shopper. Currently I'm using Ocado because they have given me a free trial of their delivery saver service. I'm not sure what I'll do when that ends next month.My personal bugbear is the way supermarkets price some things per kg, others per 100g, others per 10g and others per item in a multipack. To add to my woes, I am still unsure if the prices advertised online include any special offers, especially when money is knocked off for buying several items. I'm always looking for the best value, which generally means the cheapest items, and the mental arithmetic involved in trying to calculate this with non-standardised pricing would flummox your average quantum physicist.I refuel the car to the tune of £50.54.The bike frame we were bidding on goes for £160, which was out of our price range, so we're back to square one.Total spend: £144.88This was pretty much an average week for us. Thanks to this My Money project I have realised we do have good money saving systems in place, such as bulk buying catering packs of food online, which does save a lot.Most weeks we manage to spend a big chunk of money on less essential items, which was the sport equipment this week, but I don't want to turn into a money obsessed robot that says no to everything.I suppose it's a balance. We look for the cheapest options and then use any money saved to fund the interesting parts of our lives. The downside is that we have absolutely no savings whatsoever, but that's not unusual for these times."
business	Housing ladder: 'We live apart to save more money to buy a home'	Help to Buy IsaHelp to Buy Equity LoanRight to BuyShared Ownership	"Owning their own home feels like a distant dream for Andre Armenian and his fiancée Siân Webb. But they are determined to get on the housing ladder and are making big sacrifices to take that step.For a start, says Andre, personal circumstances mean they save more of their wages by living about 35 miles apart in their parents' houses - him in St Albans, Hertfordshire, her in Romford, Essex.""Renting is astronomical - if we did that it would be a decade before we could buy a home,"" says Andre, 29.""The path ahead of us is very daunting. We are laden with student debts, our incomes are not particularly high, our commuting costs are high, and house prices are becoming more and more disproportionate to incomes.""He and Siân, about to turn 28 years of age, reckon a £25,000 deposit will secure them a terraced house in need of repair somewhere within easy commuting distance to London. But he says: ""At times, it feels like we're racing against the clock.""And this week's revelation that a government plan to create 200,000 so-called starter homes in England for first-time buyers under 40 years old had resulted in no homes being built has underlined feelings that the market just isn't working.That scheme, included in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto, is one of many programmes announced with much fanfare that have fallen away, says MP Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, which produced this week's starter home report.While the door may have closed on this starter home promise, other schemes to help home buyers have had a longer shelf life.Andre and Siân opted for a Lifetime Isa - a tax-free individual savings account that people can put towards buying their first home (or retirement).But what are the other options, and are they enough to get people on the housing ladder? And is it, as housing charity Shelter argues, sensible to keeping promoting home ownership when it will remain out of reach for so many people?This will be closed to new savers from 30 November. Since December 2015, first-time buyers can get a 25% bonus from the government with this account when they withdraw money saved to buy their first property. The maximum purchase price is £250,000, or £450,000 in London.Critics say the scheme just increases housing demand - not the supply of new-builds - and has bolstered the profits of house building companies.But analyst Kate Faulkner, who runs the consultancy Designsonproperty.co.uk, says Help to Buy Isas have been successful, helping 220,000 people onto the property ladder and with about one million holding the savings accounts.This scheme allows buyers access to a loan equivalent to 20% of the purchase price, or 15% in Scotland, or 40% in London. The loan is interest-free for the first five years, and the applicant can only buy a new-build property.So, generally, a deposit of 5% of the purchase price needs to be paid from savings, the next 20% is borrowed from the government, and the rest is borrowed from a mortgage lender.There are worries, though, that using an equity loan can add an extra 10% on average to the price of a house, according to recent analysis by home-moving service Reallymoving.com. Because buyers have access to a larger deposit, house builders have been found to have pushed up prices.Tenants renting homes from the local council can buy them at a discount. This has been extended to housing association tenants in England.The level of the discount depends on the type and location of the property, and is generally only available to people renting from a council or housing association for three years.The scheme draws political fire, though. Selling council houses when the waiting lists are growing is not the way forward, say critics.And there's concern many properties have ended up in the hands of private landlords. Right to Buy ""has failed miserably"" in Ms Faulkner's view.This is a cross between buying and renting. It lets borrowers buy between 25% and 75% of a property, and pay rent for the remainder.The homes offered are usually new-builds or those being resold by housing associations in England. Over time, occupiers can buy a bigger share of the property when they can afford to.It certainly works for some, with more than 200,000 UK households estimated to be in shared ownership.But until you own 100% of the property you are effectively a tenant and could lose the home if you don't keep up rent payments. And there are often maintenance and service charges too.Despite an array of schemes and incentives, the fact that so many young people complain about the unaffordability of housing suggests the system isn't working.Ms Faulkner says mortgage providers, developers, politicians and local authorities must show more innovation and flexibility. The housing crisis is ""not national"", so one-size-fits-all schemes won't solve the problem, she says.She points out there are housing shortages in some areas, but not others.And often, prices are not the issue - it's high deposits. A Halifax/YouGov poll found that, with the average deposit put at £41,000, 64% of non-homeowners felt raising the money was the main hurdle.Ms Faulkner wants more tailoring towards specific areas and individual needs, and the creation of a national first-time buyer service providing independent advice to homebuyers.Some argue the very focus on home ownership makes things worse. Shelter, which focuses on the acute end of the housing crisis, says many schemes just help people who would probably ascend the housing ladder anyway.Shelter's head of policy Chris Wood says: ""We need to end the idea that home ownership is possible for everyone. Analysis says that half of the people in their early 30s will never be able to afford their own home.""His answer? ""We have to build more social housing - 90,000 houses a year. Governments have done it before, and could do it again. It requires long-term planning and investment. But research shows it pays off."""
business	My Money: 'I only paid 70p towards my dinner'	Eliza's week: Making homemade sloe gin for Christmas presents and a very expensive pumpkinHow does Eliza feel about her week?Total weekly spend: £118.25	My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they make. Here, Eliza Hunt from Bristol, records her spending over a week, and shares tips for saving including lots of cheap and healthy recipe suggestions.We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.Eliza is 24 and is a chemistry PhD student at the University of Bristol, and for this she gets paid a tax-free stipend of £15,000 a year. She also does a few hours a week of teaching during term time, and the pay for this varies month to month but averages about £2,000 over the year which she tries to put in a savings account.She pays £580 a month in rent and bills, and so is left with around £600 to pay for food, travel, clothes and anything else. Welcome to the diary of what she spent [and ate] in a week. Over to Eliza.Today I woke up at 7.30 to get ready for work and ate a breakfast of porridge made with hazelnut milk, and topped with banana, raspberries and a sprinkling of chia seeds (classic millennial). Porridge with banana and whatever dairy-free milk is on offer is a staple breakfast for me and costs about 40p per serving (not including the raspberries or chia seeds). While I made breakfast my boyfriend, Ben, made us both a cheese and tomato sandwich for us to take to work, along with an apple and satsuma for lunch (this lunch costs about £1). A packed lunch is a great way to save money, although I have zero self-control and usually eat my sandwich at about 10.30.I went to Wilko's at lunch to buy Kilner jars to make sloe gin in (Ben picked lots of sloes at the weekend), and I also bought shower gel. This came to £12.50, and I'm hoping the sloe gin will be a good Christmas gift for family and friends.Someone at work brought in stroopwafels for everyone from her weekend in Amsterdam. I spent the afternoon snacking on these, so needed a healthy meal for dinner. I left work at 5 and walked to the Sainsbury's near my house to do an attempt at a weekly shop. Due to lack of fridge space and no car I tend to do a few trips to the shops every week.Today I spent £33.22 which should keep me going for a few days, £16 of this was on a litre of gin for the sloe gin (which was reduced from £20). I got home and made a red lentil dal and a sweet potato and spinach curry for dinner (this is a really cheap meal, about £1 per portion), then spent the evening watching TV, making sloe gin and helping my friend choose paint colours for the flat she's just bought.Today I also bought tickets for a Halloween live theatre event on the SS Great Britain called Spooky Ship, which I'm really excited for. This cost £10 for a student ticket.Total spend: £55.72Breakfast today was toast with butter and marmite as I had some ends of bread that needed to be used up, not the tastiest but I'm trying to reduce my food waste. I packed some of the leftover curry from last night and satsumas and an apple for lunch. I managed to wait until 12 to eat this, mid-morning curry didn't really appeal to me!We have a bake-off sweepstake at work, everyone who wanted to take part was assigned a contestant and when your contestant gets kicked out, you bake for the group. Today, someone had baked an apple cake for us, and I had a couple of slices of this to get me through the afternoon. Eating healthily is not easy when you work in my office.For dinner I had leftover curry (again!), and I made some quick flatbreads to have with it. These are very easy to make from natural yoghurt, plain flour and baking powder. It is quite normal for me to eat the same meal a few times a week; I find it cheaper and easier to cook meals in bulk, but there is no freezer in my flat to store the extra portions so I have to eat them within a few days.Total spend: £0This morning I went on a run. I don't pay for a gym membership, so my exercise involves running, and doing HIIT workouts and yoga at home following videos on YouTube. My favourite YouTube channels for this are Lucy Wyndham-Read (for quick workouts) and Yoga With Adriene. I enjoy all this way more than going to the gym and it's all free!For breakfast I had banana porridge with oat milk. At work I was given a cheque for £50 from the university for a poster prize I won a couple of months ago, and I paid this into my account through an online banking app. I had a meeting at lunchtime which provided sandwiches, so no need to take a packed lunch. For dinner I went to Ben's house and he cooked a Cuban ropa vieja, and flan for dessert. In their house they cook for each other every Wednesday and I usually tag along for the ones when he is cooking. He asked me to buy some limes on my way to his, which cost 70p, but I didn't pay anything else towards the meal.I'm moving to a new house in a few weeks and have been trying to find a good broadband deal for the new place. I have found if you fill in your details on the internet providers' websites but don't take the form all the way through to purchase, you often get emailed with even better offers.Total spend: 70pMoney won from a poster competition: £50Today breakfast was the usual porridge, and for lunch I packed the last portion of Monday's curry, glad to finally finish that! I was teaching undergraduates all afternoon and was feeling quite hungry when I got back to my office at 5 to do some marking. My colleague had an open bag of coriander and lime Poppadom Sensations, which are my absolute favourite crisps. He offered me a few and before I knew it, I'd eaten pretty much the whole pack. I'll have to buy him a new bag of them next week! Lack of self-control with crisps runs in my family on my dad's side.After finishing work, I went home via the Co-op and bought a few things that I needed for dinner, and ingredients to make chorizo and cheese scones to take into work on Friday. I spent £13.60. For dinner I made a salad with quinoa, tomatoes, cucumber, feta, mint and parsley. I added a squeeze of lemon juice and lots of black pepper and served this with some hummus (this cost £1.50 per serving).After eating, I baked the scones, which turned out pretty well and tasted great with butter (obviously I had to test one out before taking them into work). The recipe for these was from BBC good food.Total spend: £13.60Usual porridge for breakfast again. I took my scones into work for our group potluck, and at 12.30 everyone in our research group crammed into our office armed with lots of different types of food, including a delicious curry, guacamole, falafel, and a Spanish lentil dish (plus many more things). There was also a good array of sweet items, a highlight was the raspberry and lemon Battenberg.A potluck is a great cheap way of trying food from different cultures as the only cost is what you spend on ingredients for the food you bring along.I avoided the pub after work, I felt run down from having a cold this week and thought alcohol wouldn't help (I'm definitely getting old).Although I saved money on not going to the pub, I did some online shopping when I got home and spent £24.29 on prints for the new flat from Desenio. I had been eyeing some of them up for a while and there was a deal with 30% off, so I saved £10.41 and got free delivery. For dinner I cooked pasta alla Norma following a Rick Stein recipe recommended by my friend, it had lots of feta in which is always delicious (this cost £1.30 per serving).Total spend: £24.29Today I got up around 9.30 (lie-in ruined by Ben waking up to watch rugby) and tidied my flat, then went on a run. Bristol has lots of good running spots, my favourite is the Downs which was looking very pretty and autumnal.When I got home, I did a YouTube post run stretching/yoga video, I'm training for a half-marathon and don't want any injuries and yoga seems to really help.For lunch I had a mixture of leftovers: Thursday's quinoa salad and hummus, and some aubergine left from last night's pasta - minimising that food waste.After lunch, Ben and I headed to a pumpkin patch to buy some pumpkins. We walked to the train station and got on a train to Keynsham (near to the pumpkin patch) which only took about 10 minutes and cost £3.70 for a return with a 16-25 railcard. Then it was a 30-minute walk to the pumpkins.I paid £4 for us both to enter the field (which was taken off the cost of pumpkins at the end). We chose two smaller pumpkins and a bigger one, which I strongly regretted after carrying it all the way home. The small pumpkins were essentially 'free' as they were covered by our entry fee, and the bigger one cost £5.50 (Ben paid for this). They would have been much cheaper in a supermarket, but we enjoyed the experience.On the way home we went to Sainsbury's to buy food for dinner and some stuff I'd ran out of, I spent £11.74. I made leek and potato soup for dinner using a recipe from the Guardian which involved baking the potatoes first and adding the skins to the soup too, which worked really well and it tasted great with some nice crusty bread (the soup is about 40p per serving not including the bread).Total spend: £19.44I woke up quite early again (thanks to the rugby), with a craving for pastries. On Sundays the only shop nearby that opens early is an M&S simply food, so I headed there to browse their selection of pastries, which didn't disappoint. I bought a couple of apricot twists and a chocolate and hazelnut croissant to share with Ben, and some orange juice. This all cost £4.50.I spent the day looking all over Bristol for carpets, furniture and sofas with my friend for her new flat.It was a very productive shopping trip; a spending diary of her week would look very different to mine! I didn't buy anything, I was just there for a second opinion, but she bought a lot of furniture from second hand/antique shops which looked very good quality and much more affordable than buying new. This is all good practice for one day (probably very far in the future) when I buy a house.For dinner I cooked homemade pasta with Ben. We made a sausage and butternut squash pasta from the Jamie Cooks Italy book, which was an easy recipe and just what I needed after a long day of browsing furniture. The pasta was around £2.20 per portion.Total spend: £4.50This was quite an average week for me with most of my money spent at supermarkets.Most of the meals I cooked were quite cheap, but I spent more as I ran out of some cooking things that I don't have to buy very often - one of these was extra virgin olive oil (nightmare, reminds me of the Catherine Tate posh mum sketch), why is it so pricey?!I didn't go out for any meals or drinks or buy anything particularly expensive, maybe I should treat myself next week.
business	Dirty money 'targeting UK prestige services'	Luxury goods	"Dirty money has spread throughout the UK economy, reaching as far as private schools and interior designers, says watchdog Transparency International.Corrupt individuals are now channelling their ill-gotten gains through service industries that fall outside anti-money-laundering rules, it said.This allows them to ""spend their money with impunity"", it added.UK banks and luxury goods retailers are also among the institutions which have served the most corrupt, it said.Transparency International's UK arm looked at more than 400 corruption and money-laundering cases in recent decades with links to UK companies.Firms' involvement can be unwitting, it said.The exact amount of tainted money seeping into the UK is hard to quantify, but the National Economic Crime Centre estimates the total is more than £100bn a year.Transparency International places that estimate much higher, at £325bn.These funds are often from rigged procurement, bribery, embezzlement and ""the unlawful acquisition of state assets"", it said.Some of the cases examined by the watchdog involved foreign politicians.For instance, in February 2019, after a National Crime Agency investigation, a court froze the HSBC bank accounts of Luca Filat, the son of former Moldovan Prime Minister Vladimir Filat, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for embezzlement in Moldova.Luca Filat had paid £390,000 upfront to rent an apartment in Knightsbridge, an expensive area of London. He had also funded an ""extravagant lifestyle"" using money from companies in Turkey and the Cayman Islands, including buying a £200,000 Bentley from a Mayfair dealership.Transparency International researchers also analysed ""suspicious payments"" for high-value goods which mainly came from Russia and Azerbaijan.These payments stemmed from so-called ""laundromat"" money-laundering, Transparency International alleged.They found transactions including a ""Chanel crocodile skin handbag and Tom Ford crocodile skin jacket from Harrods totalling £50,690"" and ""a shell company paying Chelsea Football Club for a corporate executive box at Stamford Bridge"" costing £126,000.There were £570m worth of these transactions between 2003 and 2017, the charity said.The funds were paid into accounts at banks including Citibank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan, HSBC and Barclays, Transparency International said, while noting that these banks had said they have strict anti-money laundering processes in place.Cash from ""laundromat"" money-laundering also found its way to prestigious public schools, including Charterhouse and Harrow, and universities including University College London and St Andrews, the charity said.Harrow School responded: ""We never comment on matters concerning pupils, but note the report emphasises that neither we, nor any of the other institutions mentioned, are implicated in any wrongdoing.""Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: ""We've known for a long time that the UK's world-class services have attracted a range of clients, including those who have money and pasts to hide.""Now, for the first time, we have shed light on who these companies are and how they have become entangled in some of the biggest corruption scandals of our time.""This should act as a wake-up call for government and regulators and deliver much-needed reforms to the UK's defences against dirty money."""
business	Where can you go if you need money in a hurry?	Disappearing payday lendersIndependent lendersAsking for an advance at workBorrowing from family and friendsVisiting a credit unionUsing a credit card or overdraftSocial schemesOr don't borrow at all	"Three of the biggest payday lenders in the UK have collapsed or closed their doors in recent times.While many people will not mourn their passing, others will wonder whether another door has closed on access to short-term relief for their finances.Research by the City regulator shows that 78% of UK adults borrowed through some kind of credit or loan product at some point during the previous year - it is a way of life.Yet, 11 million people have no more than £100 in savings to fall back on, while 4.1 million people have found themselves in financial difficulty by missing a number of repayments or domestic bills.Payday loans were charged high levels of interest, but their speedy payouts and willingness to lend to people the banks dismissed made them popular.They were controversial and their lending practices - giving people loans they could not afford to repay - ultimately led to the downfall of some of the biggest players.Wonga was a high-profile collapse last year. The Money Shop closed its doors and now QuickQuid has gone into administration. Others are still operating.""Sometimes people think there isn't an alternative, as they may have a poor credit score,"" Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive of the Money and Pensions Service, told the BBC.But she stresses that this is not true and has never been true.The number of people in England and Wales finding themselves with unmanageable debt and going financially insolvent has hit its highest level since 2010. Personal insolvencies rose by 23% year-on-year to 30,879 in the third quarter of the year, official figures show.Anyone can find themselves in a similar situation if they fail or are unable to repay their debts. For those who need short-term credit and are confident of repaying the money, there are options - as outlined by the Money and Pensions Service - without resorting to illegal money lenders, known as loan sharks.Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) are small independent organisations that offer loans to people who have been turned down by their bank or credit card company.They are all registered with the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and lend to individuals, businesses and social enterprises.There may be relatively few in your area. The Finding Finance website has a searchable list of these lenders.An employer may give some wages up front for those who need the money. They may also have grants for specific costs, such as travelling to work.Some organisations have signed up to schemes that allow people to access some of their wages as they earn them, rather than wait until a monthly payday.For those on benefits, short-term advances may be granted by JobCentre Plus advisers.This option seems to be growing in popularity, but can be fraught with emotional complications.Experts say that, even when dealing with loved ones, it is crucial to keep the financial interaction professional. So an agreement should be put in writing, a repayment plan agreed, and details should be set out of the consequences if a repayment is late or never comes.Credit unions are locally-based organisations, where members pool their savings to lend to one another. There is a cap on the level of interest that can be charged. Generally, they charge about 1% a month.The UK credit union sector remains small compared with other countries.Credit cards can be used when borrowers are confident of being able to paying off the balance.The same is true of an overdraft, which is agreed with the bank, although interest levels can be high.People on certain benefits can apply for an interest-free Budgeting Loan from the Social Fund of as much as £800.This is designed to help pay for anything from the extra bills when moving home to maternity costs.Councils may also be able to give money for essentials such as food, heating and clothes through the local welfare assistance scheme.Consumer groups stress that borrowing for everyday essentials could simply lead to bigger problems.Budgeting can tighten up finances, but there are many free advisers who will help you find the best way forward. Citizens Advice has specialist money advisers, while other organisations that can help include StepChange, Christians Against Poverty, Debt Advice Foundation, National Debtline and Shelter."
business	Blowing whistle on dirty money 'wrecked my life'	'Are we safe?'Serious sanctions'Covered up'	"Anna Waterhouse was a high-flying lawyer at Deutsche Bank in Dubai. Now she's unemployed.Amjad Rihan was a partner at the accountancy giant EY's Dubai office. He also lost his job and hasn't worked for more than five years.They both say their lives were destroyed after they flagged up suspicious activity at a major gold refiner in Dubai - Kaloti.A joint investigation between BBC Panorama and French media company Premieres Lignes shows they were right to be suspicious.Anna and Amjad didn't know it at the time but had stumbled upon evidence of an organised crime group using gold sales to Kaloti to launder British drug cash.EY, Deutsche Bank and Kaloti have all denied any wrongdoing.In 2013, Amjad was leading an audit into Kaloti's supply chain for EY.His team found Kaloti had weak checks on its suppliers - and was handing out extraordinary amounts of physical cash for gold.""My team started conducting these audits and it's really shocking what they were finding,"" he said,""Kaloti has done more than $5.2bn (£4bn) in cash in one year. Money-laundering 101 tells you not to use cash. Cash increases the risk of money-laundering.""A few miles away, Anna, Deutsche Bank's general counsel and head of compliance in Dubai, was getting suspicious about Kaloti's cash too.Panorama has seen a transcript of a Dubai court case in which she says ""never before had I seen such a catalogue of suspicious circumstances"".She told Panorama: ""A colleague came into my office and described a call from a local bank in Dubai. Apparently they had called to ask, 'Are these guys, Kaloti, are they good guys? Are we safe doing business with them?' I was surprised. That's very unusual.""The guys at the bank had noticed that Kaloti had been withdrawing very large amounts of money, so large that they had to remove this physical cash in wheelbarrows.""They said: 'We can see that quite a lot of this money is being funded by a Deutsche Bank account.'""BBC Panorama's joint investigation with Premieres Lignes shows that cash from Kaloti was a crucial part of a $250m money-laundering operation which used gold sales to launder cash from British and European drug deals.In all, 27 members of the money-laundering gang were jailed in France in 2017. The crime boss behind it, Nour Eddine Ech-Chaouti, remains on the run in Morocco.Documents seen by Panorama show Kaloti bought 3.6 tonnes of gold from a company owned by a member of the gang in 2012 alone. The gold refiner paid the company $146m in cash.The money-laundering could have been stopped years earlier if concerns raised by the two whistleblowers had been investigated properly.Anna Waterhouse reported her suspicions about Kaloti's cash withdrawals to the local money-laundering authorities. It was a decision that would wreck her life.First, she told the Anti-Money-Laundering Suspicious Cases Unit at the Central Bank of the UAE. She says they didn't investigate Kaloti - but turned on her and the bank instead.""When I explained these very serious concerns, I was straight away met with the accusation that you must have done this. How else would you know? And of course it's ridiculous,"" she said.""Why on earth would anybody run into the head of the Anti-Money-Laundering Suspicious Cases Unit to tell them that they'd laundered [money]? It's absurd.""Anna also reported the suspicions to another regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). It polices anti-money laundering regulations in the Dubai International Finance Centre.""Neither regulator that I had reported it to actually seemed to investigate the suspicions about Kaloti, but each regulator started investigating the bank,"" she said.""That was the start of what became a very, very wide-ranging investigation which to me seemed like a giant fishing expedition, intended to find a problem of any sort within the bank. What I didn't realise at the time was that I was also the focus individually of their investigation.""The DFSA investigation found bankers in Deutsche Bank's Dubai office had broken regulations in a separate case involving its private wealth division. No clients lost money, but the breach of the rules meant the bank, and its senior managers, faced serious sanctions.The transcript of the Dubai court case suggests Deutsche Bank bosses sacrificed Anna and saved themselves.It shows the managers discussed a plan to ""offer up Ms Waterhouse"" to ""express settle everything for the bank"".The bank escaped with a reduced fine and Anna was the only manager sanctioned by the DFSA. She's now appealing through the courts.""I've been a victim in all of this. It's cost me my career. It's cost me the last six years of my life. It has caused myself and my family untold suffering and nobody seems to care. They don't even seem to have a conscience about what happened,"" she said.The DFSA said it had no part in any plan to offer up Anna Waterhouse.It said there was ample reason to take action against her and the decision was made in good faith. It said it was not motivated by her decision to report suspicious activity.Deutsche Bank told Panorama it disagrees with the depiction of its treatment of Anna Waterhouse.It said this matter was thoroughly investigated more than five years ago by the bank, external advisors and the DFSA but it would be inappropriate to comment further because of the legal action.The bank said: ""We take our anti-money-laundering responsibilities very seriously and have taken extensive steps to further strengthen our controls.""Amjad Rihan wanted to blow the whistle on Kaloti too - but says his EY bosses wouldn't do it.He said: ""If you identify a suspicious transaction, you should report it to the authorities. What we identified was way beyond suspicion. Instead of reporting the crimes that I told them about, my bosses just covered them up.""Amjad fled Dubai because he was worried that his attempts to blow the whistle on Kaloti could get him in trouble with the Dubai government.He is suing EY, claiming he was ostracised and labelled a trouble-maker, then forced from his job by being pressured to return to Dubai.He said: ""Since I lost my career and I was pushed out from EY, I haven't been able to earn much money. And it's been really, really tough on us as a family financially. It's been years in court, really in order for me to carry on with life, I try not to think about how tough it is.""EY says Amjad has raised certain unfounded allegations in the court claim, which is being vigorously defended.EY also says it is confident that all legal and reporting obligations have been complied with, and that it had delivered its findings to the relevant regulator in Dubai: ""It was the work of EY Dubai that brought to light Kaloti's non-compliance with the applicable regulations and ultimately resulted in the remediation of the issues.""Kaloti says it conducted all appropriate anti-money-laundering checks.And it would ""never knowingly enter into a trading relationship with any party… engaged in financial impropriety or criminal activity of any kind"".It said cash payments were common in Dubai but it no longer buys gold for cash.The financial system is supposed to keep dirty money out. But the two people who tried to blow the whistle about the suspicious activity in Dubai both feel they have been punished.Anna's dispute with the DFSA has now been going on for six years. If her appeal isn't successful, she won't be able to work in financial services or the legal profession again.""Frankly, it's changed me as a person because I find it extremely difficult to trust in authority or to trust in people,"" she said""I've been let down by so, so many people that I find it extremely difficult to trust anybody anymore.""Following the Drug Money is available on iPlayer now"
business	NatWest online glitch resolved		"IT problems experienced by NatWest account holders on Friday have been resolved, the bank has said.The High Street bank said there had been a glitch affecting mobile and online transactions throughout the day.Friday was payday for some customers, and many were seeking out Black Friday offers.""All our services are now operating as normal. We apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused,"" a NatWest spokesperson said.The bank said debit cards, credit cards, ATMs, telephone and branch banking services had not been affected.However the inability to transfer money between accounts caused problems for some including asthmatic Tim Pitman who moved money hoping to pay for a prescription.The 49-year-old singer, from Glastonbury, said he had to borrow money from a friend to pay at the chemist, which was a 15-minute drive away.He said NatWest should have been clearer with customers who were affected.Some of those customers include people hoping to get a deal during Black Friday promotions.Tried to transfer money from my one account to the other, money has left the account but hasn’t cleared in the other! @NatWest_Help Now the app and online banking is down, not impressed!! #BlackFriday #natwest 😡😡End of Twitter post by @Lovemeloz151Research from Which? released earlier this week found the banking industry suffers around five IT failures each week typically, shutting millions of customers out of accounts and making payments."
business	The UK universities benefitting from opioid money	'Public benefit'	"King's College in London received £2m from members of the Sackler family, whose pharmaceutical firm is accused of helping to fuel the US opioid crisis.The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation gave £5.2m to mostly UK universities and charities in 2018, according to its latest accounts.King's College was the top recipient, followed by the University of Sussex which received grants totalling £1.4m.King's College said the money supported its work in neurodevelopmental studies.Since awarding the funds, the billionaire Sackler family's firm, Purdue Pharma, has filed for bankruptcy to deal with thousands of lawsuits stemming from its prescription opioid painkiller OxyContin.The lawsuits allege Purdue aggressively marketed OxyContin, while misleading doctors and patients over addiction and overdose risks.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said that opioids, which also include drugs such as heroin and Fentanyl, are the biggest cause of overdose deaths in the US and in 2017 claimed 47,600 lives.King's College said the donation from the foundation ""represents a continuation of funding to support the work of Professor Declan Murphy"".It said: ""His work crucially looks at understanding how a healthy brain develops across the lifespan; transforming understanding of common disorders like ASD, ADHD, epilepsy and Down's syndrome, and addressing the developmental causes of antisocial behaviours that pose a key societal challenge.""The University of Sussex said the grant from the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation ""has supported our centre which informs critical clinical interventions to a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia and dementia"".The Wall Street Journal estimates the Sackler family received as much as $13bn (£10bn) in profit from Purdue Pharma, according to court records.Under the terms of the bankruptcy deal, Purdue will be dissolved and the money raised will go towards settling the lawsuits.At the time it was announced, Sackler family members said: ""It is our hope the bankruptcy reorganisation process that is now under way will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit.""The Sacklers are prolific philanthropists who have given millions of dollars to the arts, education, medicine and charities mainly in the US and the UK.Earlier this year, however, a number of high profile art galleries announced that they would no longer accept money from the family.They include National Portrait Gallery and the Tate in London as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York.The Roundhouse, the music and arts venue in London, had been awarded £1m in 2018 from the Sackler Trust.But a spokesperson told the BBC that the Roundhouse had made a decision ""not to accept the donation at this time"".""To do so risks distracting from our work with young people, and that's our priority.""In March, the Sackler Trust and the Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation announced it would temporarily suspend new UK donations.At the time, Dame Theresa Sackler, chair of the Sackler Trust, said: ""I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.""The current press attention that these legal cases in the United States is generating has created immense pressure on the scientific, medical, educational and arts institutions here in the UK, large and small, that I am so proud to support. This attention is distracting them from the important work that they do.""The University of Sussex said: ""This year, and in light of the legal situation in the US, the University and Sackler Trust decided not to progress with further pledges."""
business	Rail fares to rise by 2.7% in January	Calls for change'Patchy performance'	"Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 2.7% more for rail tickets from 2 January.The rise, announced by industry body the Rail Delivery Group, is lower than the 3.1% increase at the start of 2019.Train companies say this is the third year in a row that average fares have been held below the benchmark inflation measure on which rises are based.But many commuters will still face an increase of more than £100 in the annual cost of getting to work.Independent watchdog Transport Focus said a majority of rail users did not feel they were getting value for money.The news comes as commuters on South Western Railway services are steeling themselves for a 27-day rail strike next month.Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members will walk out in a long-running dispute over guards on trains.About 40% of annual rail price rises in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated, which means that they are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for the previous July. This year, that figure was 2.8%.But RPI inflation is generally higher than the most widely watched measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index.And passenger groups have repeatedly called for the system to be changed, since RPI inflation was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013.Rail Delivery Group chief executive Paul Plummer said the extra money was allowing the train companies to invest in improvements to the network, including 1,000 extra services a week in 2020.He added: ""The industry will continue to push for changes to fare regulations to enable a better range of affordable, mix-and-match fares and reduced overcrowding on some of the busiest routes.""Mr Plummer said that 98p in every pound from fares went towards the cost of running the railway.A spokesperson for Transport Focus said: ""We speak to thousands of passengers each year and we know that less than half feel they get value for money.""After a year of patchy performance, passengers just want a consistent day-to-day service they can rely on and a better chance of getting a seat.""Transport Focus called on passengers to ""make their voice heard"" and claim compensation every time they suffered a delay or cancellation.Payouts vary depending on the type of ticket, the length of delay and the operator. Some firms begin paying compensation if a train is delayed by 15 minutes.Passengers normally need to claim the compensation as payouts are not automatic with most operators."
business	My Money: 'BOOM, suddenly £14.99 less rich!'	Olivia's week: Cheap but lethal wine, facial wax strips and free chicken from Nando'sOlivia's spending outcomeTotal weekly spend: £266.58	"My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they make. Here, Olivia Davies from Salford records her spending over a week, and shares how easy it is to spend money on clothes and make-up.We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.Olivia is 20 and is currently a second year student at Salford university, studying broadcast journalism. She also works 20-30 hours a week at Nando's.When she's not working, studying or on holiday, she loves to go to the gym, keeping herself fit and active. She can't wait for you to have a read of her blog to see what a young, part-time student and worker really spends her money on. She says there's no hiding any of her spends now. Over to Olivia.9:30It's Monday, and I'm still off university for another two weeks! So, it's off to work for me at 12:30 until 16:30. I've been working around 20-30 hours a week at Nando's, bringing in money for me to save and spend!10:50As I've got nothing to do until work, I had a quick browse online to do a little bit of TLC. As every girl knows, we've got this obsession to keep on top of our eyebrows, lashes, skin, and body, so I thought this extra time was a good excuse to treat myself! I ended up buying Bondi Sands everyday gradual tanning milk as everyone knows how much easier this is than trying to get that perfect streak-free finish with instant tan at 23:00. I also bought myself some facial wax strips! Being a dark-haired girl, the moustache and mono brow is always there.I got these products through Pretty Little Thing, where I've got free next day delivery for a year! So I only ended up spending £14, including delivery. I tried to get student beans discount on these products but they don't do it on beauty for some reason.16:30I've finished work! And the beauty of working at Nando's, free food! So, no spending money on my lunch when I'm on a shift, happy days. I helped myself to a red pepper dip, a quarter chicken (medium spice of course) and some of the new saucy spinach.22:30Gym classes, done.Tesco shopping with the mother, done.Tea, done.Bath, done.Time to relax and get to bed, this Monday I didn't spend too much, no bills came out and no money came in. But I did treat myself a little, (the Tesco shopping I didn't pay for, I was just helping my mum do some of the weekly shop).Total spend: £1410:00I've just woken up and there's no work today! So, I'm going to get up, get ready, and then go out for lunch with my Nana. We've found a lovely little place to have our lunches recently, and we'll see if she's treating me or not, but I always, always, offer to go halves!14:30Lunch finished with the Nana, we enjoyed a lovely chicken stroganoff and finished with meringue nest and summer fruits! I offered to pay, as usual, but Nana insisted this was on her and that I should get our next lunch! £0 spent on lunch today, lovely stuff.21:00I'm going out next weekend to Newcastle and of course, I need a new outfit, but recently I've been trying to buy new outfits off Depop and not off the original sites! It's so much better to buy second hand and do your little bit to recycle clothing, so I had a scroll and found a perfect little red Oh Polly dress for only £23 with delivery. The dress on the original site is £38 so saving myself a lot of money considering it's only ever been worn once.Total spend: £239:30I wake up to messages asking me to come in for the morning shift (9:30-17:30) instead of my evening shift, which sees me working 17:30 until about 1:00, I say yes! I'd much rather work the morning and have my evenings free, so I pack a quick breakfast of yogurt and berries into my bag and get to work for 10:00. They didn't mind me being slightly late as obviously I was asked last minute. If I decided not to bring my own breakfast, I could've had some at work, I could've been very tempted to get a McDonald's breakfast from the restaurant next door.17:30It's finally 17:30 and I've finished work, enjoyed my free lunch as always, and I was in the debate of going to the gym or going to see my boyfriend. My legs were still killing from the two gym days previous so I decided to rest up, and see my boyfriend.19:00Jordan, my boyfriend, decides it's time we need to go to the Trafford centre and get him the Vans he's wanted for so long! We buy his Vans and debate getting some tea but we choose the option, ""we have food at home"". I swear we've grown old already! I also took a look round some shops for some wet-look leggings, as they seem to be what everyone wears nowadays, but I can't find any I like, and I'm not about wasting money so I leave it! Which leaves me spending a grand total of absolutely nothing today!Total spend: £09:30No work today, and I've not been rung to come in last minute either. I stayed at my boyfriend's last night so I drive home and get on with some house chores, so the mother doesn't bite my head off!13:00My mum's actually started doing gym classes, and she's desperate for a stopwatch to time her classes and make sure she's filling the classes right, so I have a look on Amazon for her, I find a nice blue watch but the delivery wouldn't let me have it for another week... too long, I'm impatient. I did have free next-day delivery but it was a trial for six months with being a student, so I decide to wait until tonight and use my boyfriend's account to order the watch and save some dollar.18:00Fast forward time a little bit and I've gone to the gym but I'm now waiting for the next class to start. While waiting I get a little thirsty but I forgot my water bottle, so I have to buy one for £1.So, as you do, I start scrolling through Instagram and see this gorgeous make-up artist. I've been looking for someone to do my make-up for my birthday in a couple of weeks. I message this MUA and she immediately replied, £20 now as a deposit, and £20 on the day, which somehow to me, makes it seem that little cheaper in two instalments… so that's me £20 down within a matter of minutes.22:00Gym's all done, and I've drove to my boyfriends, to see him of course but to also rob his Amazon Prime account to order the stopwatch wrist timer for my mum. I pop in my own card details on his account and BOOM, suddenly £14.99 less rich!Total spend: £35.998:00First of all, Friday the 13th... everyone sees this as a bad luck day, but I like to be unique and see it as a day of luck… it's payday every Friday so my bank balance has nicely been topped up, but that also means it's time to pay my rent!I pay my mum £60 every Friday when I get paid. If I can't afford it one week, which is rare, she does let me off, because she's an angel, or if she owes me any money then she lets me keep the rent. My mum never asked for rent, but I feel because I work and still eat, and use up all the electric, it's only right of me to pay my way.19:00Fast forward to the evening and I've finished an eight-hour shift at work, where I successfully didn't spend a penny! But now I'm at the Trafford centre, and I've got a long, long list of things I need! Such as jeans, a new foundation and wet-look leggings. Anyone that knows me, knows I always wear the same things so it was time to treat myself. I go to Topshop and buy some blueish jeans... but with student discount it comes down to £37.85 instead of £42! Every little saving helps! But my spending didn't stop there... I also purchased a new foundation, my skin is really dry so it's hard for me to find anything that sits nice but I heard lots of good things about Fenty hydrating foundation so here I am, £27 more out of pocket, after treating myself to that particular foundation.20:00Oh, don't worry, the spending hasn't stopped yet, Friday 13th seems to be unlucky towards my bank account. We decided to go for a meal but I grab tap water, and a pizza so only end up spending a bargain of £10.25, happy me!And to top it off, we go to my friend's house where I buy a bottle of £4 summer fruits wine, cheap, but lethal! Trust me... oh, and don't forget the £10 petrol I need to put in every Friday (joys of driving).Total spend: £149.109:00I've woken up, not a hangover in sight! But then I remember, I forgot to get my wet-look leggings yesterday so I quickly get on Pretty Little Thing and order two pairs. One is in a size 8, and the other a size 10, as my sizes in pants are always different so I'll just send one back! I end up spending, with student discount, £22.50. I'm a bargain hunter if I do say so myself...Early Saturday wake up means one thing, early gym session, with the mother, I hop in the car with her and we go to her body balance class! She smashed it, as always.13:00Time for lunch after the gym, there's nothing really in the house to eat as mum hasn't done the weekly shop yet, so we nip to the corner shop and she buys me stuff to make an omelette! My favourite.15:00Now it's time for my three-nine shift today! I was so tempted to buy myself an iced latte from McDonald's before work, everyone knows I'm an iced coffee addict! But after my heavy spending yesterday, I decided it better to make my own at work (mine are just as nice anyways)!20:50Home time! Doesn't seem like I'm going to spend anything else today, go back to my boyfriend's tonight and probably straight to sleep for me. I've not got the energy at night, I'm definitely more of a morning girl!Total spend: £22.5010:00Well, that was a lie-in and a half for me! 10:00 is a late rise for me, it always puts me on edge for some reason getting up that late. But today is a chill day, I have work at half five tonight, where I'll be staying on for a close, but I'll worry about that later.13:20Today, so far, I've been helping my boyfriend clear out his room. I bought him a lovely bracelet for Christmas but he somehow lost it this summer and we've been looking for it ever since. He always seems to lose his most expensive items as just last week he lost his airpods… I'm starting to think me helping him ""clear out"" his room is really his last desperate attempt to find his bracelet.14:15IT WORKED! We found his bracelet, and I've never been happier. It was hidden somewhere between all his unfolded clothing in his wardrobe, at least I won't have to fork out for a replicate this Christmas! Win, win.17:30Before I know it, it's time for me to start work. I've come in to a hectic shift, to say the least, and I can't already wait for it to die down. I knew I should've bought a coffee before I started, I won't have time to make myself one now with how busy it is!Total spend: £21.99It's been a very spontaneous spending kind of week, I've got to admit. I don't always buy myself new jeans, make up, and facial waxing strips, even though I wish I had the income that would let me! Oh, but wait, it's Monday, and it's the 16th, which means one thing for me, it's my gym payment day, which already leaves me with £21.99 out of pocket and I've not even been to sleep yet.Rent - £60Clothing - £83.35Beauty - £61Petrol - £10Food and drinks - £15.25Gifts - £14.99Leisure - £21.99Illustrations by Jamillah Knowles"
business	The spectacular fall of money manager Neil Woodford	No time for City fashionsDown to the farm?	"Every rider knows that after a bruising fall you should get back on the horse, if you can.This week, stockpicker Neil Woodford - an equestrian enthusiast - was unseated, told his champion was being sent to the knacker's yard, and responded by closing the stables.Woodford Investment Management is shutting after its eponymous boss was sacked from its flagship fund, once a big money winner for investors but now to be wound up, leaving some with heavy losses.Few give the 59-year-old any chance of saddling up as an investment manager again, marking the end for someone whose decisions affected billions of pounds worth of retirement savings.Neil Woodford made his name at Invesco Perpetual. Anyone investing a pension fund of £10,000 in his first funds would have seen it grow to £250,000 by the time he resigned to launch his own business 26 years later. Initially, there was similarly successful growth when he set up on his own.Mr Woodford was being spoken of in the same way as US veteran Warren Buffett. He was as close to a household name as is possible in the world of investing. People piled into his flagship UK Equity Income Fund. At its peak, it had £10bn of people's money in it.What followed were some disastrous investments and immensely poor performance. Big pension funds and armchair investors started pulling out their money in droves. In June, those left were stuck when the fund was suspended by its administrator. They could face big losses, particularly if they invested at its peak.This week, the end came swiftly as the administrator - Link Fund Solutions - said the fund, now worth £3bn, would be shut down and Mr Woodford removed as manager.It was a decision he said he ""cannot accept"". But, within hours, Mr Woodford announced he would abandon the last two funds, Income Focus (which has since also been frozen) and Woodford Patient Capital, and close his investment management business.Mr Woodford has remained silent in public since, but one industry man says he will be ""devastated"" by the collapse of his business.""He did not walk away from Invesco to put his name above the door for this to happen,"" he said.""He was diligent, even caring, but in a bigger company he was challenged.""Operating an eponymous business prompted questions about checks and balances. ""In hindsight, it seems there was not enough challenge,"" he added.It is a widespread view that Mr Woodford moved away from what he was really good at to more, unnecessarily, risky investments - which also said something about his character.""He was naturally curious to find new ideas, tenacious and a workaholic,"" says another in the industry who dealt with him regularly.As for humility? ""He did not score well on that,"" he added.""I do not like hearing someone say, 'I'm right and the market is wrong'.""Mr Woodford was always his own man. He was not an Oxbridge-educated fast-tracker, but studied agricultural economics at Exeter University. He is more likely to be seen in jeans and a jumper, than in a suit and tie.He once told the BBC he liked to ignore ""the fashions and fads"" that could build up in the City of London.So, instead of basing his business amid the rich history and resplendent architecture of the City, he stuck it on a business park next to the Oxford Ring Road.He said he never yearned to work in the City, having been based in Henley on Thames at Invesco Perpetual.Even so, an unremarkable building with plentiful parking next to a fitness centre on the outskirts of Oxford is the polar opposite, even though the region is a hub for tech start-ups and new businesses in which he had a keen interest.Inside the office this week, 30 staff were being consulted about their jobs, while outside the rain hammered down on a shredding service's van. It was a suitable meteorological metaphor.Mr Woodford drives fast cars - Porsches have been a favourite - but he has been taking the Audi to work, arriving consistently early. His journey brings him from one of his multi-million properties - the one with the equestrian complex where he lives with his wife in the Cotswolds countryside.He has another on the Devon coast which he reportedly paid for in cash.According to someone who knows him, Mr Woodford is a ""young"" 59 year-old, still in ""good nick"", who could still raise millions from investors willing to trust his long-term record. Any return to the fray though is ""very unlikely"".Some investors, whose retirement plans may be very different given the events of recent months, may feel aggrieved about seeing the man who controlled their fate retiring to a comfortable life with his horses.They may also wonder why his company continued to take fees of more than £60,000 a day to run the Equity Income Fund while it was frozen.Many others will consider what effect the fall of one of the biggest names in fund management means for the sector as a whole, with regulators and fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - Mr Woodford's most influential cheerleader - also under the microscope.In a pub a few miles away from Woodford headquarters, the Barclays Botley Bankers Investment Club has met once a month for 20 years.Like many other similar clubs around the country, its members pool some money then discuss where best to invest it.The retired bankers of Botley invest directly, so were not exposed to Woodford's funds. However, according to one of their members Neil Staples, the overwhelming emotion is not one of relief, but sadness.""So much money is tied up for so many people, so we feel very sad for them,"" he said.The 65-year-old former branch manager says he spoke to someone recently who put their money into a Woodford fund simply because he recognised the name.""People are tempted by the story, but the idea of a 'star' manager has taken a major hit,"" he says.The Woodford star has certainly fallen, much to the cost of his clients saving for a rainy day. Many will hope it changes the way the sector is promoted and operates before Mr Woodford rides off.You can hear more from Woodford investors on Money Box on BBC Radio 4 at 12:00 BST on Saturday 19 October, and again at 21:00 on Sunday 20 October"
business	'We get our money's worth with package holidays'	'Lots of cash, little time''Dynamic packaging'	"Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary recently declared package holidays ""over"" after the collapse of Thomas Cook. But travel experts say they are growing in popularity, particularly among younger travellers.Kate and Colin Rawson, aged 30 and 40 respectively, recently opted for an all-inclusive cruise around the Mediterranean for their honeymoon. The couple from Warrington have done a number of all-inclusive holidays around Europe but this was their first cruise.""Colin and I love eating and drinking whilst on holiday, so if we didn't do all-inclusive it would cost us a fortune. We always get our money's worth,"" said Mrs Rawson.She says they're yet to be disappointed: ""We do a lot of research - we like to look at reviews and whether everything is included.""The Rawsons are not alone. According to a recent report on the UK travel-industry, the popularity of all-inclusive holidays which typically include accommodation and meals as well as flights, is growing.The research by management consultancy Deloitte found those aged from 16 to 44 were particularly keen on package deals.Richard Slater, who runs a travel agency in Macclesfield, Cheshire, says the number of young people booking breaks with them has increased.""There are still the gap year guys that go off and do their own thing, but with people going into jobs and apprenticeships, they've got a lot of cash to spend but not as much time.""You'd think they'd go off and book it online but they actually just want to be able to say 'it's all booked, it's all fixed together'.""It's not just young people booking package breaks. Around half of UK holidaymakers take at least one overseas package holiday each year, according to travel trade organisation Abta.Meanwhile, UK government statistics reveal a growth in the number of people taking package holidays from 15.9m in 2014 to 18.2m last year.The most popular overseas destination for package holiday makers is Spain.Abta says package holidays have changed significantly from the 1970s. It says there is a greater emphasis on personalisation, where holidaymakers can mix and match what they want to include instead of purchasing a pre-defined package.Figures from Market research firm Euromonitor support this. It says so called ""dynamic packaging"" has increased 40% over the past five years. This is where consumers canbuild their own package of flights, accommodation, and car rental instead of purchasing a pre-defined package.It's this type of holiday purchase that appeals to Ada, a 51 year-old from Edinburgh, who typically books hotel and flight combinations with Expedia and lastminute.com.""I usually check the website of the airline first and then I have a look at the hotel's website and see if I can get a better deal and usually I've found it saves me at least £100 or more for a holiday of about a week,"" she told the BBC.Travelling with her husband, they've taken these kinds of trips to France, Belgium and Ireland - and have a forthcoming one to Sweden.""They do have quite a range of hotels at a range of budgets - we always do mid-budget hotels and we never fly business class.""She says while it can be better financially, such deals can have drawbacks: ""If there's a huge problem with the flights, these companies can't help you. They try to help with the hotels but if it's the airline's fault, you're on your own.""Despite this, she says this kind of package holiday beats the traditional alternative.""I did a full package once many years ago and it just encourages you to eat even when you don't want it. It's like, 'I've paid a lot so I may as well'.""For Kate though, having everything included makes things easier: ""Even when it's all-inclusive, we still go out for meals outside.""We literally gave the travel agent a few details of what we were after and within a few hours he came back and had the whole thing sorted for us. All we had to do was pay."""
business	My Money: Lucy's guilt over spending £1.50 on tuna	Lucy's week: A lodger moves in, and guilt over a tin of tunaTotal weekly spend: £492.75How does Lucy feel about her week?	"My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they make. Here, Lucy Holligan from Leicester, records her spending over a week, and shares tips for saving including a cheap, healthy recipe suggestion.We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.Lucy is 27 and works in marketing. She bought her first house this June. She pays £436 a month towards her mortgage, while her lodger pays her £400 in rent each month. Her hobbies are playing tennis, travelling and watching comedy shows. Over to Lucy.Today I was supposed to go shopping but due to last night's excesses I didn't think a reverse bay park was a good idea.That meant I had nothing in the house for dinner apart from a baked potato. So, even though I knew it would cost more, I went to the local shop where I spent £1.50 on a tin of tuna and £1.10 on milk.I was actually quite annoyed with myself because this happens every week; I go out, there's nothing in the house the next day, I pick up a ""few bits"" from the local shop and end up spending more than I should.I've recently bought a house, having previously lived at home for two years where I saved up money and wore bras that slowly turned into barbed wire.I'm incredibly lucky to be in the position that I'm in at 27, but moving out has made me quite money conscious and I'm forever in the ""reduced"" aisle!Total spend: £2.60Today my lodger moved in. This is going to help out massively with my mortgage and overall spending because, although things are all right with money at the moment, I just about break even and I would really like to have some money to save.It does mean that I lose my Single Persons Discount for council tax (25% - roughly £30). And my house insurance has increased by £3.80 per month - which I don't think is too bad. My plan is to overpay on my mortgage by £100 per month, which should bring down my mortgage term from 30 years to 23 years.This week's weekly shop came to £24.20 and no doubt I'll be back later in the week for other bits and bobs. I try and plan out my meals in advance so I'm not tempted to get a takeaway or bury my face in a bowl of pasta, but food is one of the main areas where I fall down when budgeting. I'm always trying to make quick, healthy, low-cost meals but 90% of recipes seem to have over 20 ingredients and I still have no idea what star anise actually is.Total spend: £24.20Extra income from lodger £400I pretty much bring the same lunch into work every day: A chicken sandwich, banana and Eat Natural bar. This works out at about £1.80 per day. I'm aware that it's not the cheapest it can be, but seeing as lunch is the pinnacle of my working day, I'm willing to take the hit.In the evening I played netball at the local leisure centre, which costs £2 per session. I really enjoy the class as it's a good way to unwind while keeping fit and at £2 I think it's quite good value for money.Unfortunately I've had to get my phone screen repaired which is an unexpected spend this month. It cost me £60 to get a man from a local shop to repair it as opposed to the phone manufacturer, which would have been upwards of £100.This would have been great, had the guy not smashed the back of my phone in the process - and hastily glued on a replacement cover. The smudges are his fingerprints.Thankfully when I moved out, I prepared myself for these sorts of ""emergency"" spends as well as the big upfront costs such as car insurance, TV licence and Road Tax etc. because in most cases it's cheaper to pay annually rather than monthly.So I've added them all up, divided the amount by 12 and set up a monthly direct debit into a high interest, easy access savings account. That way I have enough money to pay most things annually and I should have a little bit extra.Total spend: £62Today I paid £20 for half a tank of petrol. This usually lasts me around four or five days and I shop around for the cheapest rates, which just happens to be at the supermarket around the corner from me.Tonight's meal is cod and couscous, which is incredibly easy to make and budget friendly.£1.35The price of a budget, healthy meal for one83pCod (£3.30 for a bag of 4)30pLemon12pCarrot10pCouscous (70p for a bag)MethodTotal spend: £20I actually managed to spend no money today. There's a tuck shop at work that's within eyeshot and therefore really hard to resist. But I have to admit there's the odd occasion where I can't resist the call of McCoys salt and vinegar crisps, which would set me back around 70p.When I got back from work I went to the gym, which costs me £25 per month, and went about making dinner.Today's meal was tomato pasta. I've worked out that the foundation to cooking is browning off some onion and garlic - and then you can basically add anything and confidently call it a meal. So today I browned some onions and garlic, added four mushrooms and half a tin of chopped tomatoes. After the pasta was cooked I poured the sauce over it and sat down to watch TV.Total spend: £0Today I took my car for its MOT and service, which I was quite nervous about and for good reason as it failed its MOT! I got the good news via WhatsApp complete with pictures of my worn brake discs and ""dangerous"" condition of one of my front tyres.To cut a long story short, the whole lot cost me £376 but luckily I had already budgeted for this in my emergency/ upfront costs account.This account also covers my car insurance, which is in excess of £800, (even though I've been driving for nine years) as this is the first time I've been put down as the main driver of the car. My mother was quick to point out that my solution to this problem was a criminal offence called ""fronting"".Total spend: £376Friday usually means drinks at the pub or if we're feeling particularly adventurous ""out out"". As it happens we just went out to the local pub for a couple of drinks.I've got a Monzo account which works a bit like a prepaid card, only you can see how much you've spent and on what. I usually put £100 on it at the start of it and watch with horror at how quickly I spend it.Thankfully tonight was a cheap night as there were only two of us. Although I only spent £7.95 this week, I would say my average is about £20 per week - and around £30 if I was going ""out out"".Total spend: £7.95This sounds pretty high! But I think this is because of the amount I spent on my car. Otherwise I was pretty restrained.It was the little spends which got me. You kick yourself because you should be more savvy.There's a convenience store around the corner where I get milk and cans of food from when I'm feeling lazy. Usually I would buy food from the supermarket.I'm still a novice when it comes to saving money. My mum gives me lots of advice. And I also trust Martin Lewis. He is very credible."
business	Rise in teenage money mules prompts warnings	'I was a teenage money mule'	"Criminals are recruiting a rising number of teenagers to act as money mules to help them launder the proceeds of crime.The number of cases of 14 to 18-year-olds who have allowed their bank accounts to be used to divert funds has grown by 73% in two years.Banks are using the data, from fraud prevention body Cifas, to alert parents to the risks their children face.Teenagers are being recruited to the illegal activity via social media.Sports clubs, schools and colleges are also key recruiting grounds for criminals who want to move money through accounts to make it look less suspicious to banks. The youngsters are given a cut for allowing their account to be used. Often they ask no questions over the source of the money.Most money mules are young men. Those who try to quit may be threatened with violence by the criminals who recruited them.If they are caught, they could face prison, as well as future difficulties with their finances, such as having their bank account closed and finding it difficult to apply for credit in the future.""Have you ever held £2,000 at once in your hand?"" That was the line used to tempt Holly into becoming a money mule.At the age of 17 and still at school, Holly (not her real name) was approached on Instagram, then Snapchat, by a person who promised to pay her a decent sum, if she let him use her bank account to move money.""I just eventually gave in,"" she said.Read more about Holly's storyTeenagers can open their first current account in their teenage years. The Cifas figures show that money mule cases last year among 14 to 18-year-olds rose by 20% on the previous year, and by 73% over two years, to 5,819.Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""The increasing use of social media means that young people have never been more vulnerable to becoming victims of fraud.""Many youngsters are unaware of the devastating consequences that fraud can have on their future opportunities, and so teachers, parents and carers can play an important role here by ensuring young people have the necessary knowledge and skills to prevent them from unwittingly falling victim to fraud, or even become perpetrators themselves.""Banking trade body UK Finance is behind a new awareness campaign encouraging parents and guardians to look out for danger signs.They include telling youngsters to keep bank details safe, telling them to be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money, and looking out for signs of their child suddenly having extra cash, or becoming secretive, withdrawn or stressed."
business	Why is the Fed pumping money into the banking system?	First things first: what's the repo market?What happened this week?Why did the rates suddenly spike?Is that the mystery solved then?Should we be worried?Did the Fed's intervention work?	"The US central bank has pumped more than $200bn (£160bn) into the financial system this week - the first time there's been such an intervention since 2008.The Federal Reserve's aim was to stabilise what is usually a calm part of the market.Interest rates in the so-called ""repo market"" had shot up to 10% in some cases - although the cost of borrowing in that market more typically hovers around the benchmark rate set by the Fed - around 2%.So what happened and should we worry?Banks, hedge funds and other players borrow money regularly on a short-term basis to ensure their books are in order, no matter what their daily activities.The borrowers typically offer government bonds or other high quality assets as collateral, which they repurchase, plus interest, when they repay the loan - often the next day.Those repurchase agreements give the repo market its name.This is a huge market, with some $3tn changing hands each day, according to the US Office of Financial Research.Under normal conditions, interest rates in the repo market are low, since the loans are considered safe and there's plenty of cash on hand.But this week the cost of borrowing shot up - toward 10% in some cases. And the rate at which banks lend to each other - the Fed's benchmark - exceeded 2.25%, the top of its desired range.The rise prompted the Fed to take action. Four times this week, it injected money into the market, offering to buy up to $75bn in treasuries or other assets from banks in a bid to boost bank reserves and keep them lending.Strains in the repo market were among the first signals of trouble ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. Back then banks had suddenly become wary of lending, worried there were unforeseen risks associated with assets that had previously been considered safe.This time, analysts think what's happening is caused by an issue with money supply.Money has been sucked out of the market by two events that happen to have coincided. The first is a tax deadline which means firms need cash to pay what they owe the taxman. The second is the due date for payments on a recent offering of government bonds.On top of that the Fed has also been steadily reducing the overall supply of money in the market, aiming to get conditions closer to how they were before the financial crisis.A lot of people still don't think those explanations are enough to explain the scale of the interest rate rise.""The thing that's really confounding is just how much rates moved in a short time,"" says Zachary Griffiths, rate strategist at Wells Fargo.""Everyone's kind of trying to get a firmer grasp... on all the different nuances that could have led to such a big move.""There could be other one-off factors triggering this spike, such as an oil bet that went bad after the attack on Saudi Arabia, says Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities.But she notes that the repo market also showed signs of stress in April and December, suggesting an underling structural issue - namely that the Fed has gone too far in reducing reserves.""We are in uncharted waters,"" she says. ""The Fed is trying to figure out the appropriate level of excess reserves.""On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell conceded that the Fed had not anticipated such a large spike in interest rates, despite warnings of a possible crunch.Mr Powell was also quick to talk down concerns that the issue signals a bigger problem or that the bank had lost its grip on its policy.""We don't see this as having any implications for the broader economy, or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates,"" he said.And the Fed used to conduct these kinds of market operations prior to the financial crisis, without prompting undue concern.Rates dropped back following the Fed's action, and so far stock markets and other parts of the system don't appear to have been affected.But analysts warn that the turmoil is likely continue, saying the end-of-quarter rush to square up company balance sheets could cause more stress.""Our big takeaway there is, we're going to have to keep an eye on this,"" says Mr Griffiths."

business	General election 2019: How do government finances work?	Why does a government borrow money?How much does the government borrow?How does the government borrow money?When does it have to be paid back?What is the difference between the government deficit and debt?	"In the run-up to the 2019 general election, political parties have been setting out their plans for the country.Some have been promising to borrow lots of money to fund them. So how does it work when a government wants to borrow, and when does it have to pay it back?The government borrows because it spends more than it receives in revenue, which comes mainly from taxes.It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes - and in some years that has happened.But governments have not always been willing to increase taxes enough to cover its spending, partly for political reasons - it would be unpopular with voters.It's also down to economic reasons - if people have less to spend, it is bad for economic growth and jobs.The amount the government borrows to make up the difference between what it spends and what it collects is known as ""public sector net borrowing"". It's also often referred to as ""the deficit"".The government has borrowed £46.3bn so far this financial year, from April to October, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).That's 10% more than the same period in 2018, and equates to about £656 per person in the UK.The big increase in the deficit after the 2008 financial crash was caused by an increase in government spending, and a fall in how much it was receiving in taxes.The government borrows this money in financial markets, by selling bonds.A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect the repayment.Interest is also paid to whoever owns the bond in the meantime. So it's basically an interest-paying ""IOU"".The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some.The appeal to the investors is that British government bonds are seen as essentially no risk - there is no risk that the money won't be paid. You won't lose your money and you know precisely when and how much the payments will be.It varies a lot.Some government borrowing has to be repaid in a month, but some lending is for as long as 30 years.The minimum repayment period is just one day, while some bonds have been issued for 55 years.The deficit is the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends each year.It covers most of this gap by borrowing, or sometimes by selling assets like property.In years when a government spends less than its income, it's known as a surplus.The deficit is not to be confused with debt, although both are linked.Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years.So it's a much larger sum. The debt owed by the UK government climbed by £32.1bn to £1,798.5bn between October 2018 and 2019, says the ONS.The government does repay debt on the due date, but usually has to borrow new money anyway."

People have said enough is enough and are getting on with their lives, something that really shone through in November.""The Nationwide also said that election periods tended not to have a direct impact on the housing market. Broader economic conditions were more dominant over the decisions of buyer or sellers.""Rightly or wrongly, for most home buyers, elections are not foremost in their minds while buying or selling their home,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.View affordability data by UK regionView affordability data by local authority areaThe national average isThis calculator assumes you need a deposit of at least 5% of the value of the property to get a mortgage.

business	Tiffany hopes to regain its sparkle with new owners		"One morning earlier this week a small crowd queued patiently on Fifth Avenue. Once the guard eased open the doors, uniformed staff were on hand to usher in customers, some upstairs to the cafe, others to browse the store's offerings, from diamond engagement rings to novelty items like the $180 dog bowls.A team of high school majorettes, in town from Texas to perform in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, took selfies and mingled with tourists and older ladies in heavy makeup.While Tiffany's flagship store is as drenched in luxury as ever, the message is clear: you don't have to be one of New York's wealthy elite to treat yourself to a bit of sparkle or a spot of breakfast here. It's open to everyone.""It's a label thing,"" said Emily Brewster, 14. ""And at the same time you know it's going to be worth it.""The company, which has a long history as America's most glamorous jewellery retailer, is being bought up by French fashion house LVMH, it was announced this week. It raises the question: will LVMH still want to target customers who are more likely to buy a sterling silver heart than a string of diamonds? Or will the new owner prefer to burnish the Tiffany brand by taking it upmarket?""I want them to continue to cater to the general public because that's who makes the brand. It's not the fancy people,"" says Kelly Hammer, a 39-year-old former schoolteacher who lives in New Mexico.She runs a Tiffany-focused Facebook group with more than 15,000 members and owns hundreds of Tiffany pieces herself, funding her collection by reselling jewellery items online.Ms Hammer is, she admits, obsessed with the brand, so much so that her husband even had a gun made for her in Tiffany's distinctive robin's egg blue.""For me, it's way more than a brand,"" she says. ""It makes me happy.""But Tiffany hasn't done enough to please investors in recent years. The share price slid 40% between mid-2014 and mid-2016, since when it's been on something of a rollercoaster ride.Bernard Arnault, Europe's richest man who is at the helm of LVMH, is betting that Tiffany & Co can regain its former sparkle. But the purchase is a gamble on just how much Tiffany's past will carry it through to a more glittering future.The company, founded in 1837, is credited with inventing the modern engagement ring and pioneering the mail order catalogue. First ladies since Martha Todd Lincoln have worn Tiffany jewels and its designs have graced sports trophies, church windows and the seal on the American dollar. It has drawn in tourists for 150 years or more.But it was the 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, that cemented its status in the public imagination and paved the way for mainstream popularity.It is a store, Ms Hepburn's Holly Golightly declares, where ""nothing very bad could happen"". In the film, even the request to have a toy ring (from a box of Cracker Jacks snacks) engraved is treated with consideration. And Ms Golightly is very much a wayward maverick rather than a high class debutante.The company's chairman at the time Walter Hoving knew exactly what he was doing, says John Loring, Tiffany's former design director.""He was completely aware of the implications of everything,"" he says. Mr Hoving lobbied against having Marilyn Monroe in the lead role and took a tough line with the film company before opening the doors to the cameras.But in the end it proved a brilliant marketing move, says Mr Loring. ""Suddenly it was everyone's Tiffany and they could go in.""The film helped to launch Tiffany's global expansion. In 1963, it opened its first branch in San Francisco. Today, it has more than 300 stores around the world, including more than 30 in China, its fastest growing market.Under chief executive Alessandro Bogliolo, who has been in charge since 2017, Tiffany has begun a three year refurbishment of the Fifth Avenue store and more frequent jewellery releases, including partnerships with stars like Lady Gaga and Elle Fanning. It will replicate the New York store's cafe in China.""They have taken a lot of steps,"" said Lorraine Hutchinson, research analyst at Bank of America.She said a sales uptick in early 2018 suggested the company's investments were working, but US-China tensions, a relatively strong US dollar and Hong Kong protests have hurt tourist spending, and sent its shares back down.Speaking to investors this week, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said Tiffany needs time and money to implement its plans. As a standalone, publicly-listed company, he argued, those were luxuries it didn't have.""When you have to do quarterly reporting, it's not that simple. The pressure is tremendous,"" he told analysts this week. ""By buying Tiffany we would take them off the market's eyes to some extent.""Now, as LVMH prepares to absorb Tiffany into its portfolio, the firm's many existing fans are hoping it won't lose its ""essence"" .Some though are bound to remain loyal whatever happens.In March Kelly Hammer will go to the New York store for the first time in her life, a special trip to celebrate her fortieth birthday.""I'm going to be there for a week and the hotel is right next door,"" she says.""I'm going to spend literally eight days inside that store."""

business	HSBC and Santander customers set for refund	Disturbance policy	"People who bank with HSBC and Santander are in line for a refund after a watchdog said they had failed to alert customers who went into the red.The Competition and Market Authority said they broke rules by not sending text messages allowing people to avoid unarranged overdraft charges.HSBC said it would refund a total of £8m to 115,000 customers.Santander also said it would comply, but has not worked out the cost of the refunds yet.The CMA said the banks first breached the rules in February 2018.It said the refunds would cover all fees incurred by customers who had gone into unarranged overdrafts without being warned in time to take action.The competition watchdog added that it was requiring the two banks to have their compliance with the rules checked independently.HSBC's refund amounts to an average of just over £69.50 for each customer affected.However, the actual refund that any customer receives will depend on how much he or she was charged for being overdrawn.HSBC was found to have committed two breaches of the CMA's Retail Banking Market Investigation Order.HSBC broke the rules because it had a policy of not disturbing customers after 22:45, the CMA found.This meant that if customers went overdrawn between that time and 23:45, when balances were calculated, they were not alerted by text.An HSBC spokesperson said: ""Having been the first bank to auto-enrol customers to unarranged overdraft SMS alerts, and seeing that six in 10 of our customers who receive one then pay in money, avoiding additional charges, we appreciate how helpful these text messages can be.""We apologise to those customers who for different reasons did not receive an alert. We will continue contacting customers who incurred overdraft charges as a result of these issues to apologise and provide a refund.""Santander broke the rules six times. It said: ""We are very sorry that some customers in certain circumstances were not sent the required overdraft alerts. The introduction of these alerts is a move we welcomed and believe is a real support to customers.""We have carried out a detailed review to understand why the errors happened and have taken steps to fix the issues. We are now working to identify and refund all affected customers as quickly as possible.""This is not the first time that the CMA has taken action against a financial institution over this issue.In August, it ordered Nationwide building society to refund £6m in charges to 320,000 overdrawn customers after failing to send them the correct text warnings.The CMA found that Nationwide had broken rules over text alerts 20 times."
business	How much! Why are service station snacks so expensive?	'Good experience'	"An urgent need to go to the loo prompts most visits to a motorway service station, rather than any particular desire to stop and shop.But the price drivers and their families pay if they then choose to stock up on snacks has been laid bare by mystery shoppers.A bottle of water costs four times more than in a supermarket, the snapshot of prices by insurer Admiral suggests.No wonder value for money at services scored poorly in a recent driver poll.Only 59% of visitors rated food and drink as good value for money, compared with a general satisfaction rate of the service station experience in England of 90%, according to lobby group Transport Focus.Operators point out that these sites can be expensive to run, and visitors can park and use the facilities for free, without any obligation to buy anything.Yet, many drivers complain that they have little choice but to pay high prices, as service stations are generally the only option on the country's motorways.The mystery shop by Admiral researchers is only a snapshot of 21 of the UK's service stations during October, out of more than 100 in the UK. Prices can change and promotions can easily bring down prices.Families will be planning motorway trips to visit relatives this Christmas, and may be more conscious of prices at this already-expensive time of the year.So they may choose to fill water bottles for free, rather than pay up to £2.29 for a 500ml bottle of water, as was found by the mystery shoppers at Beaconsfield Services on the M40. The operator, Extra Motorway Services, has not responded to a request for comment.Across all 21 service stations the average price for water was £1.32 more expensive than a 44p bottle that could be found in a supermarket - so four times the cost.Clare Egan, head of motor product at Admiral, said: ""We all expect to pay a little more for convenience, [but] grabbing the essentials from home or at least a supermarket before setting off could result in some big savings on the overall cost of your journey.""Given the availability of free water refills at all of the service stations and the push to be plastic-free, motorists don't need to spend anything on bottled water.""The full basket of drinks and snacks price-tested by researchers also included a cheese sandwich, a cold sausage roll, a packet of ready salted crisps, a packet of wine gums, a bar of chocolate, and a bottle of Coke.Roadchef's Durham services on the A1(M) came out most expensive of the 21 tested. The total cost was nearly £10 more expensive than a supermarket best price, researchers said.A spokesman for Roadchef said that, unlike the vast majority of its outlets, Durham had to buy in sandwiches rather than making them on site. He said most other items were uniformly priced across sites, competitive against others, and there was a range of choices for customers.""Like all our sites Durham resembles a mini high street, and offers premium and value options depending on our customers' preferences,"" he said.He added that there were greater overheads in running service stations, which were required to be open for 24 hours every day, unlike many town and city centre retailers. They also faced costs to maintain land and, at times, water treatment works.The mystery shop also revealed big differences between service stations on the cost of petrol, with unleaded prices varying by 20p a litre.The tired motorist might also be surprised to discover that the price of a regular latte varied by £2 depending on which service station they stopped at. Such price differentials for the nation's favourite bought hot drink can also be found on the High Street, so it is an issue not only found on the motorway.In July, Transport Focus published the results of its customer survey covering all of England's service stations. It found a generally high level of satisfaction, with Roadchef's Norton Canes services on the M6 toll coming out on top. Yet, it too raised the issue of prices.""Motorway users tell us they have a good experience when visiting service areas, but it's clear that many do not feel the experience is good value for money,"" said Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith."
business	Would you accept a loss to keep your money safe?	What are bonds?What does a negative bond yield mean?Why not stick to cash?Are investors panicking?	"Some of the world's biggest investors are so worried about the future of the global economy that they have taken the extraordinary step of paying for governments to look after their cash.They are nervous about a no-deal Brexit and the ongoing trade war between the US and China, as well as signs of a slump in demand in Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse.In times of crisis, investors usually flock to so-called safe-haven assets like gold, government bonds or good old fashioned cash.But for big investors, like pension funds, cash isn't practical and gold is considered risky.That has driven them toward government bonds and, unusually, investors are paying to hold them.In order to raise cash - to pay for everything from big infrastructure projects to covering the cost of their own debt - governments borrow money.One of the ways they do that is to issue fixed-term bonds, under which companies and individuals lend a set amount of money to the government, which promises to pay interest every year until it returns the total amount borrowed on a pre-agreed date in the future.Or, at least, that how it's supposed to work.Countries that are considered to be good borrowers, like Germany, will pay less interest than risky debtors, like Argentina, which is considered more likely to renege on its IOU (I owe you).Some big investors, such as pension funds, are limited to how much money they can put into riskier assets, which - twinned with a negative interest rate in Europe - has made bonds issued by the likes of Germany, France, Switzerland and Japan a very attractive purchase.For example, the overwhelming demand has sent the interest paid on 10-year German bonds crashing to minus 0.65%, meaning investors will make a loss if they lend money to Berlin.In effect, investors are paying governments to borrow their money - and that does not bode well for those hoping for economic growth.It means that people who make a living from predicting what economies will do in the future, are betting on interest rates remaining negative for at least ten years.And, worse, the 0.14% yield on 30-year German bonds suggests that investors are expecting interest rates to stay in the red for the next three decades.Tristan Hanson, who invests in bonds for M&G, says the current German bond price shows a ""high degree of risk aversion"" in Europe, where investors would rather accept a loss on holding their money than buy an apartment or invest it in stock markets.""They are saying: 'I'd rather have a guaranteed small loss than risk a big loss in some other asset class',"" Mr Hanson explainedFor big institutional investors, cash is costly because they can't just put it under the mattress, according to Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, Laith Khalaf.""I could build a massive secure basement and keep all my cash in that,"" he said.""But actually that's quite expensive and if interest rates return to normal, I'm going to have an empty basement.""Big investors don't tend to keep their assets in a bank in case that bank fails, he added.""If institutional investors are putting £30m in a bank, it means they have a lot of risk if that goes under,"" Mr Khalaf said.Big investors also like to hedge liabilities by buying bonds, he said. A pension fund that knows its pensions in 20 years will cost a certain amount will buy bonds that it expects will let it meet those obligations.He said the negative bond yields reflected broader economic woes.Will Hobbs from Barclays' investment arm believes investors' worries are overblown, saying the economy ""doesn't look that bad"".He said the fortunes of the global economy were tied to the US, which ""looks healthy"".""All economies are perfectly capable of starting a fight in an empty room.""But the big recessions they tend to be driven by the US economy and what happens there,"" he said.He said the negative bond yields had driven some investors to buy up gold, pushing prices to a six-year high.But the investment boss warned people to be careful of buying the precious metal.He said it's ""very difficult to value"", adding, ""there's a huge amount of emotion invested in the price""."
business	Tourists facing travel money 'shock' this summer	Getting the best from your travel money	"Tourists could face a ""shock"" this summer when they travel abroad according to foreign currency experts.Those that buy euros at the airport can expect to receive around 98 euro cents for their pound. Better rates can be found by buying in advance, with the Post Office offering €1.0819.But that's still a long way from the summer of 2015, when tourists were getting at least €1.32 for their pound.The big fall came in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union.Tourist rates are based on trading levels on the international currency markets.On those markets the pound earlier hit $1.2382, the lowest level against the dollar in 27 months.That fall was attributed to rising fears that the UK will leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.The pound also fell against the euro, hitting €1.1062, its lowest level for the year.""It will be a big shock for tourists to Europe if they are expecting to get good value this year,"" said James Hickman, the chief commercial officer of travel money firm FairFX.He does not expect any recovery in the pound until the Brexit situation is resolved.""All pointers are that we're in for a rocky road,"" he says.""If people are waiting to buy at a better rate I don't think that's going to happen.""If there is a no-deal Brexit then he thinks the pound could go lower. He points out that some in the financial markets think it could hit parity against the dollar, meaning tourists would receive just $1 for each pound they exchange.At the moment the tourist rate for the pound against the dollar is $1.2127. That's down 5% on this time last year, according to the Post Office.Analysis by Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporterMillions of us would have spent many hours hunched over a computer trying to find the perfect accommodation and flights for a summer getaway,Currency experts say holidaymakers should put the same amount of effort into organising holiday money.That certainly means never waiting until you reach the airport to exchange money, as bureaux in the airport complex usually have the worst rates.Timing can be tricky - it is difficult to predict how the value of the pound will move, so one common suggestion is to change half of your holiday money weeks in advance of departure, and the rest just before, to hedge your bets.Ordering currency online in advance and then collecting the cash in person can also secure a better rate.Cash exchange is not the only option. Carrying a wad of notes can be dangerous and not always covered by travel insurance. The market for specialist pre-loaded currency cards is growing, and banks are competing on the rates and deals for overseas use that they offer to current account holders. So doing your homework on charges and shopping around is advisable.In general, using your regular debit card can be expensive, owing to the extra charges, and remember to let your bank know if you are going away to avoid being locked out by anti-fraud processes.If you do use a card on your holiday, shops, restaurants and cash machines will usually ask if you want to pay in pounds rather than the local currency. Always choose the latter. Tourists can lose up to 10% by paying in sterling rather than the domestic currency.However, if you haven't already booked your trip, then there are destinations where your pound will go further.The Post Office says it has seen a surge in sales of Turkish lira, which has been hit by political turmoil.Compared to last summer, the pound is up around 14% against the lira. Iceland is also better value than last year, the pound is up 12% against the Icelandic krona.The pound is also a little higher against the South African rand.The weak pound can also be more than compensated for by falls in local prices, the Post Office says.It tracks the prices of a range of items in European family destinations, including meals and drinks.It found that prices had fallen in half of the 15 locations, including the Algarve in Portugal.""Picking a destination where prices on the ground are low can outweigh the impact of a weak exchange rate, but a destination where prices and cheap and sterling is strong is the best bet,"" said Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money."
business	Banks disagree on how to pay for fraud refunds	'Disappointment'	"The UK's banks have disagreed on how to pay for refunds to customers who have been tricked into transferring money to sophisticated fraudsters.A temporary agreement has been in place since May, making it easier for victims of so-called authorised push payment (APP) fraud to get money back.Now it has been revealed that there is no industry consensus on long-term funding to refund blameless victims.Without a new deal, victims could be left without protection from January.In the first six months of this year, people lost £208m to fraudsters posing as bank staff, building contractors, solicitors or even police and persuading them to send money from their accounts.Only a fifth of that was refunded, generally when it was clear that the customer was innocent and the bank had not taken enough care.Since May, a new code has been in place, backed by a temporary agreement between eight banks to pay refunds in no-blame situations where neither the victim nor the bank was at fault.There were plans for this agreement to be superseded in January by a new levy of 3p a time on bank transfers which would go to a reimbursement fund.But a number of banks have refused to support the levy idea, according to Pay.UK - the body operating the UK's money transfer system - which said there was ""no industry consensus"".In part, this was because some providers felt those who did the most to prevent fraud would still pay the same levy as those which did little.A lack of a new deal could reduce protection from the new year.Consumer group Which? said the next government should make the code and reimbursement mandatory to prevent innocent scam victims from losing life-changing amounts of cash.Pay.UK is now urging the industry and regulators to work together to find a solution. ""It is critical that the whole industry plays its part,"" said chief executive Paul Horlock.Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents the UK's banks, said: ""Ensuring victims of APP scams receive compensation when their money is stolen by criminals is an absolute priority for the payments industry.""There is strong agreement across the sector that we must all work together to create a central, long-term, sustainable funding system. We are therefore disappointed a way forward has not yet been agreed.""The industry will continue to call for new legislation to make the code mandatory and agrees with the Treasury Committee and Which? that issues of liability and reimbursement should best be addressed by new laws, rather than just a voluntary code alone."""
business	Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money?	Total annual corporation tax receipts	The claim: Cutting the rate of corporation tax in the UK always increases the amount of revenue it raises.Reality Check verdict: No it doesn't. Although there have been increases in revenue following recent cuts in corporation tax, the amount raised in the two years following the rate cut in April 2008 fell.Boris Johnson, one of the candidates to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister, told party members in Darlington that cutting the rate of corporation tax always increased the amount of revenue raised.The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again to 17% next year.Revenue has been rising, despite these cuts in the rate. The theory behind this is that reducing the tax attracts companies to the UK and encourages firms to invest in their businesses, which means more money is eventually paid to the government.But there are other things going on here - the period since 2010 has been a time of gradual recovery from the financial crisis, so you would expect company profits, and hence the corporation tax take, to have been rising.£mSo since 2010 there have been examples of revenue rising following a corporation tax cut, although the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says that the amount raised would have been higher still if the cuts had not been made.Let's look at another example - the 2007 Budget announced that the main rate of corporation tax would fall from 30% to 28% from April 2008.It will surprise nobody to learn that revenue from corporation tax fell sharply in 2008-09 and 2009-10 as the financial crisis hit company profits.But just looking at tax rates and revenues without considering what is going on in the economy and the overall tax system is misleading.More worthwhile assessments would need to look at the longer term effects of a cut in corporation tax on the profitability and behaviour of companies.HMRC produces a ready reckoner which estimates that a one percentage point cut in the tax would cost £3.1bn in 2022-23.But the government has also done modelling to find out what effect things like changes to wages and consumption in the long term could have on the government's tax take.It concluded that over a 20-year period they could reduce the losses to the exchequer from the cut to corporation tax by between 45% and 60%.And after changes to the rate of corporation tax for 2020-21 from 18% to 17% were announced in the 2016 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that this would reduce revenue by £945m.So there is considerable doubt about the precise long-term effects of a cut in corporation tax, depending on what you take into account.However, no authority suggests that it will always increase revenue.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

business	How much pocket money should we give our kids?	Bank basics	"If parents can afford to give pocket money to their children, then much more often than not they will pay them in cash.One survey suggests that 84% of British parents give notes and coins to their children, typically an allowance - including some discretionary spending - of £7 a week.Yet, by 2028, banks predict that for every 10 occasions when adults buy something, they will only use notes and coins once. For the rest, we will mostly use cards or digital payments.So what will that mean for the nation's children? Will today's youngsters be learning about money using currency that is close to obsolete? Will parents have to find a new way of paying pocket money, or decide not to bother paying at all?Experts say that paying a small amount, however infrequently, can help youngsters learn about money and budgeting.It seems that the children themselves agree, especially if pocket money depends on completing chores.Nine-year-old Yusuf says: ""It is making you feel like when you are older and get a job - when you do stuff and get paid for it.""But obviously you are going to get more when you are older, rather than just 50p a day.""Pocket money surveys rarely agree on the going rate for children's allowances. The Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, has been running such a survey since 1987, which is one of the most well-established.Its latest findings suggested a wide range of average amounts in different parts of Britain. Others suggest the Halifax estimate of the typical weekly payment is rather high, but there is general agreement that cash is currently the preferred choice.Research has suggested that money habits are set by the age of seven. At a meeting of head teachers and authorities on Wednesday, some will call for better financial education in primary schools.Whatever children are taught at school, a few pennies at home - starting in cash - can go a long way, according to Sarah Porretta, of the government-backed but independent Money and Pensions Service.Her advice for parents includes:For those parents who no longer carry cash - just using payment cards and smartphones - the mother-of-two says: ""The trick is to go and get some coins, just so your children have the opportunity to interact with them.""Then talk about what you are doing with money. If you are paying with a card or with a phone talk to children about that and link it back to those coins they have handled.""A growing band of pocket money smartphone apps suggest a different answer.""The way we interact with money has changed. Pocket money is changing. We pay for things with the touch of a button,"" says Will Carmichael, father-of-two and chief executive of one of those apps - RoosterMoney.""Traditionally pocket money sits in a jar at home, you add your coins, you can see it build up, and then you take that down to the sweet shop. That is no longer the case. You may use it for [video game] Fortnite online. You might use it to pay for a pair of trainers from an online shop.""We are bringing pocket money online and making it more tangible again.""The app starts for four year-olds with an online reward chart, it moves on to a pocket money tracker which allows youngsters to set savings goals. Top of that list, according to the company's data, is Lego, followed by phones, and holiday money.Eventually, it allows them to move on to spending with a pre-paid card. Data shows most pocket money is still spent on sweets, although books are second. The app also allows them to donate some of the money they have saved to charity.However, the more advanced features cost a fee - an extra expense not suffered by parents who pay their children in cash.Mr Carmichael argues that the charge costs parents far less than swimming or music lessons, but still teaches youngsters a practical life skill.The next step for most youngsters is opening a bank account. Savings accounts can be opened from the age of seven, and current accounts from the age of 11.""These are a great way of introducing your children to the world of banking, allowing them to use 'grown up' features like ATMs to get cash, or increasingly to make contactless payments, and even mobile payments if they have a smartphone,"" says Brian Brown, head of insight at data analysts Defaqto. ""They also make it easier for family members to gift them money.""Some of the accounts also pay interest, although not at high rates, allowing young people to get into the savings habit from an early age.""By setting up standing orders you can pay children their pocket money regularly, with no moaning over missed or late payments - or even worse, each parent giving them their pocket money and paying them twice."""
business	'Freehold charges cost us our dream home'	What is an estate rentcharge?'Unsellable'Call for reform'Fairest way'	"""To be honest we were absolutely devastated by it. You would never buy a house without being able to sell it again"".Jen Tweedle is talking about the moment she and her fiancé Peter realised why their house sale fell through over the summer.Their buyers couldn't get a mortgage after discovering Jen and Peter's new-build, freehold property was subject to an estate rentcharge.Peter said: ""We lost the sale and our dream house... and that was very disappointing.""An estate rentcharge can be imposed when private developers build housing estates that the local authority won't ""adopt"", meaning councils won't pay for the upkeep of public spaces or roads on that estate, or pay for things such as street lighting.When that's the case developers - or once any building works are finished, residential management companies - establish the charge to pay those bills.But some residents have criticised this process, saying they have very little control over the charges and that there's not enough transparency about exactly what they're paying for.In addition to this, crucially, if homeowners fall 40 days behind on their payments, the law on estate rentcharges allows developers, or management companies, to take possession of a property to ensure they get the money they're owed.Although this is extremely rare, the fact that the legal right exists can put potential buyers off and leave mortgage providers unwilling to lend on properties subject to rentcharges.However, the Home Builders Federation says rentcharges are the fairest way to make sure communal areas are paid for and maintained.In Peter and Jen's case, their potential buyers couldn't get a mortgage agreed because the home was subject to an estate rentcharge.""We bought our house [in Oxfordshire] back in July 2016 and we were informed by the estate agent there'd be a service charge which, coming from London, we weren't worried about,"" Peter says.""Basically we weren't told by our solicitor or by our estate agents what an estate rentcharge actually meant in terms of the law"", Jen adds.She's also unhappy at how they were treated by the developers, their solicitors and estate agent, and how they didn't even find out their rentcharge might be a problem until they tried to sell.""The sudden surprise of it all, the fact that the term 'your house is unsellable' was thrown at us... you would never buy a house to not be able to sell it again.""For now, Peter and Jen have taken their home off the market and will look again in the new year.""We have to be resigned to the fact that this problem may reappear.""Probably about £2,500 has already been paid out and we still need to pay solicitors another £1,500 hoping they will be able to sell our house, we don't know.""Maybe our house is unsellable.""Beth Rudolf, a director of the Conveyancing Association, says the failure of house sales due to estate rentcharges is becoming more common.""Just yesterday a developer refused to vary the terms of a rentcharge that the lender had confirmed was not acceptable to them because of the risks to themselves and the borrower,"" she says.""We need the government to intervene to change the law so that someone cannot effectively lose thousands of pounds because they forgot to pay a £6 rentcharge.""We would absolutely expect that any rentcharge owner should be able to recover arrears of payments in the normal debt collection way, but not to be able to grant a long lease or possess the property.""Andrew Whitaker from the Home Builders Federation says because of cuts to local authority budgets many local councils just don't have the money to adopt estates like they would have in the past.""As part of a development we [developers] build places - not just homes. So things like parks, shared spaces, roads,"" he says.""In the past we used to hand all of this to the local authority and they'd maintain it in the future. Because of cuts and local authority budgets being strained they are less keen to do this.""They still need maintaining and the fairest way to do this is to establish an estate rentcharge.""You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm or listen again here.Follow Money Box and Dan on twitter."
business	Doorstep scams 'linked to modern slavery'		"A worker who came to Britain has said he was bartered between criminals and then used to work on doorstep scams.The man said he was beaten, threatened and forced into work in return for tobacco, alcohol and bread and butter.National Trading Standards (NTS), the frontline UK consumer protection body, said this was an example of modern slavery behind traditional scams.It urged consumers to be aware of home improvement scams, as well as alert to the individuals who may be involved.The slavery victim, who has not been named, told NTS he was never paid but was ""totally powerless"" as the criminals took his passport, ID and money.""We would fix up houses, do gardening, everything, house to house,"" he said. ""I had to work from the early morning until very, very late, seven days a week.""I was sold, from person to person - bartered for right in front of my face. I heard one man say I wasn't even worth £300. I felt worthless.""Eventually, he said he walked for 10 days to get away from the slavemasters, and was helped by charity Hope for Justice.NTS, which was set up by the government in 2012, said gangs targeted vulnerable young men from deprived areas. Many were alcohol or drug dependent.Lord Toby Harris, who chairs NTS, said: ""The doorstep scammer is not a lovable rogue. Often behind the person who turns up at your door offering cut-price services is a serious criminal.""Not only are they happy to rip off older people, those living on their own, and indeed anyone who is taken in by their patter, but they may also be exploiting and even enslaving vulnerable people to help them carry out their crimes.""He said that consumers needed to be aware that many of the scams that occurred were modern versions of traditional scams.Some of the biggest emerging threats include:Door-to-door scams related to solar panels and home insulation are also proving popular for rogue traders, trading standards officers said."
business	People who trusted Neil Woodford with their money	'This isn't business as usual''The situation is frustrating''I never made any money out of Woodford''I was saving for my grandchildren'	"People with pensions and savings invested in Neil Woodford's now suspended flagship fund have expressed concern over how it was promoted.Mr Woodford - one of the UK's most high-profile stockpickers - stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fund earlier in the week after increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back.Some of those investors would include pension funds, responsible for people's life savings.Thousands of individuals also chose the fund for their self-invested pensions or Individual Savings Accounts (Isas), often through fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown. The platform has been a cheerleader for Mr Woodford, but some say that went on for too long.Hargreaves Lansdown's share price has taken a heavy hit since Tuesday's announcement, falling another 6% on Wednesday.Many smaller investors are also questioning whether there were sufficient warnings about the possibility of being locked out of their investment.Gus Harris-Reid, 32, has about £6,000 stuck in the suspended fund.""If it was business as usual, I would not be concerned. Now, I may take some or all of it out and invest elsewhere when I can,"" the mechanical engineer from Edinburgh says.""The bad publicity may mean a drop in value, though.""He says that all fund managers can suffer a bad year at any time and investors should be prepared for that.However, the suspension meant this was a different grade of seriousness.""The fact it had to be blocked is concerning,"" he says. ""It has shaken my faith.""Another 32-year-old, Robert Taylor, from London, says he was unaware that a fund could be locked up like this.""It was not made clear that this could happen. It is frustrating,"" he says.He says there is likely to be a ""mad rush"" of people withdrawing when the fund reopens, although this simply risked realising a loss.""I have an Isa regular saver and switched my portfolio to stop investing in Woodford around six months ago. I didn't sell my stake at the time as I presumed he'd eventually turn it around. This doesn't look to be the case and now I can't change my mind,"" he says.Former pensions minister Ros Altmann told the BBC that regulators needed to look at the risk warnings given to investors in general, as it should be made clear that in some circumstances, people would not be able to get money out.Paul Adams, from Birmingham, says that he sold his stake in the fund ""at a heavy loss"" just two weeks before the suspension.""I invested in three of his funds due to his reputation. However, over the years I have seen my investments fall by as much as 33%,"" he says.""I have never made any money out of Woodford.""He says that fund managers' reputations can take years to build up, but were quick to fall - and the value was ""nosediving"".He says he was ""bemused"" as to why Hargreaves Lansdown continued to promote the fund as one of its favourites, in its Wealth 50 list.Mr Woodford's funds were only removed from the chart on Monday.Stuart Evans says that he was already an investor using the Hargreaves Lansdown platform, and studied the Wealth 50 list for ideas for long-term investments to help pay for his grandchildren's further education in the future.""As a result, I felt it was a reasonably sound investment,"" the 68-year-old says.""I was looking for something that would not let me down and would grow steadily over the years.""At its launch of the Woodford fund, a research director at Hargreaves said that Mr Woodford ""was one of the finest fund managers of his generation"" and he intended to invest in the fund, as did his wife.There are 1.2 million people on the platform and it continued to promote the fund when it saw a significant downturn.""We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford's multi-decade track record remains compelling - but we don't underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford's recent performance,"" Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC.On Monday, it dropped the Woodford funds off its favourite list. On Wednesday, it bowed to pressure to drop its management fee for Woodford investors.It is not the only platform which promoted Woodford funds as an investment. Another - St James's Place - moved away from Woodford funds on Wednesday."
business	'You can get your money when you need it'	'There's a need'Bad habit?'Safety net'	"Jacob Cushley works in a Stonegate pub in Plymouth. He is one of 125,000 UK workers whose employer lets them access part of their salary as they earn it rather than waiting for payday.""It's helped me out with being able to do things socially and also with some unexpected bills,"" he says.""It's reassuring to know you can get your money when you need it.""Wagestream, the firm behind the Stonegate scheme, is in talks with NHS trusts, local authorities and the Army.It says hundreds of thousands of public sector workers could be given early access to their earned income in the next 12 months.Workers whose employers sign up to the scheme are given an app that shows them how much they have earned throughout the current pay cycle and how much they can withdraw early.Their employer decides what limit to place on withdrawals, to ensure staff still have money coming into their accounts on payday.It's a scheme designed to help workers avoid high cost credit like payday loans and overdrafts. For Jacob, it stopped an unexpected bill becoming a damaging debt.Half way through the month his phone stopped working, meaning he could no longer use his digital bus ticket. ""I had to get a new bus ticket to get to work, which is about £78,"" he told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money.""That's quite a lot of money to come up with out of nowhere when you budget your wages throughout the month and you're getting to that halfway point where you've overspent on luxuries already.""Wagestream helped me afford to get into work when I was stuck instead of taking out a payday loan or something, which is what I would have done.""The fintech firm, which launched last year, charges employers around £1 per employee per month for access to the scheme and then charges staff a fixed fee of £1.75 each time they make a withdrawal.It covers the payment to the worker and then recovers the money directly from that worker's next pay cheque.""We get a higher amount of withdrawals in the final 8-10 days of the month,"" says Peter Briffett, CEO of the start-up. ""That's when the payday loan companies start advertising too.""When we roll out Wagestream to a new company, we will typically see 40% or 50% of the workforce adopt it in the first few weeks. That shows there's a need.""Not everyone thinks this is necessarily a good idea for struggling staff. Kara Gammell, the journalist behind the blog Your Best Friend's Guide to Cash, has concerns.She says: ""Technically this isn't a loan; there's no credit and no interest but rather it's early access to your own money in return for a small fee, so it may seem affordable. But it could be a bad habit to get into as you'd always be playing catch up with your money""As most of our household bills are paid monthly, consumers run the risk of finding themselves short come payday, and missed payments can jeopardise the security of your family and the roof over your head.""Others agree. Wagestream is supported by a number of social enterprises and charities, including Fair By Design, an organisation working to end the poverty premium, and by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF).But Helen Barnard, deputy director of policy & partnership at the JRF, believes the system is helpful for workers: ""What we've seen in the last few years is a rising tide of in-work poverty. More than 4 million workers are in poverty.""A lot of those people don't have savings so if they have an unexpected bill in the middle of the month then they can get really stuck and get pulled into the spiral of high cost credit, they have to take out credit which then has charges which they have to pay back the next month.""The idea of Wagestream is that it gives people access to their earnings once they have earned it rather than waiting until the end of the month, which helps them avoid that high cost credit trap.""Jacob Cushley also believes his employer has enough protections in place: ""I feel like for some people it might be tempting to just get your money early and spend it on socialising but there's a safety net.""If you're weak and your friends are egging you on to come out and you do decide to dip then you're only allowed 30% of your earnings to date and you're only allowed to take out three transactions a month.""It's a reassurance that you have money to get you through the month - and not just a small amount - and there's no charges on top or interest either.""With more public and private sector employers signing up, thousands more workers will soon find out if this helps them budget or encourages them to spend.You can hear these interviews and more analysis by downloading BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money podcast"
business	Millennials 'wrongly relying on inherited money'		"Some millennials have unrealistic expectations of inheritance and how it may unlock the door to buying a first home, a survey suggests.One in seven young adults expect to inherit money before they are 35, although in reality the typical inheritance age is between 55 and 64.The survey, by wealth manager Charles Stanley, suggested that young people expected to receive nearly £130,000.However, the median average amount handed down was only £11,000.Advisers said that relying on an inheritance to pay a deposit for a first home was often misguided, even if older family members intended to pass on money when they died.""People are living longer than ever, so relying on an inheritance to get on the housing ladder is a risky strategy as you may get less, and much later than planned,"" said John Porteous, from Charles Stanley.""In reality, most people save and invest to get on the housing ladder. Starting early and planning ahead is essential to achieving the deposit you need.""The research suggested that 22% of millennials expected to receive inheritance to use as a deposit, although official statistics suggest only 7% actually did so.The average expectation of when that inheritance would be received was the age of 50, yet figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that they would have to wait for at least another five years.Even when that money arrived, ONS data showed that inheritance was much less lucrative than many asked in the survey expected.Others in the industry have argued that the UK public is ""largely ignoring"" financial planning for death.Dan Garrett, founder of will writing service Farewill, said that 30 million people in the UK had not written a will, partly because it had dropped down the household ""to do"" list.He also called on the government to clarify its plans for probate fees.The government is planning to substantially increase the cost to bereaved families of settling the estates of deceased relatives.The changes were expected to start last month but have been delayed."
business	Set curfew for online money lending, say academics		"Late-night online access to credit is leading people to borrow more money than they can afford to repay, according to academics.Newcastle University researchers said a ban on online borrowing - primarily through payday loans - between 11pm and 7am could protect consumers.Money is often borrowed to fund late-night, impulse buying, they said.The option for people to block spending on gambling sites is already available on various apps.The research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), warned that people were being encouraged to borrow more than they could pay back because sites were designed to give a false sense of control. It also found that people's mental health could be affected.""Urgent reforms are needed to protect consumers from financial and psychological risks,"" said lead researcher Dr James Ash.""The shift online has increased availability of payday loans to people previously excluded by mainstream lenders.""But our research shows that digital access to credit only offers quick fixes - it does not address borrowing's root cause.""Researchers interviewed borrowers, analysed websites, and spoke to debt charities.They found that some borrowers welcomed not having to explain themselves or face being judged, or rejected, by a real person when applying for loans online.However, the result was that they were targeted by loan providers with messages about extra credit through mobile devices.The Consumer Finance Association, which represents a number of short-term lenders, said: ""The modern economy, and changing nature of the UK workforce, mean that financial needs are no longer restricted to regular business hours.""The [researchers] clearly want to ignore the benefits of these loans, but for hundreds of thousands of customers this is an important financial service and something that they can now access when convenient for them."""
business	UK's biggest money manager warns on climate catastrophe	Lesson learntThe changing business climate	"The world is facing a climate catastrophe and businesses around the world must address it urgently or face the ultimate sanction for a public company, shareholders who refuse to back them any more.That is not a message from an environmental action group but from the largest money manager in the UK, Legal & General Investment Management, which manages £1 trillion worth of UK pension fund investments.Its climate warning was the top of a list of concerns about the way companies are run.Other red lights included the level of executive pay, lack of diversity in senior corporate roles, the role (and cost) of political lobbying and the poor quality of the financial information provided by auditors.Legal & General insist that it is not just virtue signalling.The company voted against the re-election of nearly 4,000 directors in 2018 - an increase of 37%. That included votes against over 100 board chairs on the basis of gender diversity alone.Legal & General's director of corporate governance, Sacha Sadan, said it was getting tougher with company boards and managements.""2018 was a record year for us as we continued to engage with companies on a broad range of issues, using our voting power to influence change on behalf of our clients. The increased figures reflect the higher standards we expect companies to adhere to""The collapse last year of construction and services company Carillion which continued to pay out high salaries, shareholder dividends and get a clean bill of health from its auditors until just months before its sudden liquidation caused widespread outrage and shone a light on the standard of company stewardship in the UK.A recent report from a committee of MPs was sceptical about asset managers' appetite and ability to raise the quality of company management.The business select committee chair said last month: ""We do not have confidence in institutional investors in exercising their stewardship functions. We cannot rely on shareholders to exert pressure.""Legal & General admit they too have made mistakes.In 2012, the company voted in favour of a pay formula for the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon that saw Jeff Fairburn awarded a pay packet of £100m. Mr Sadan told the BBC it had learnt its lesson. ""Since then we insist that maximum payouts are capped.""The VERY best way for investors to exert pressure is to sell their shares - or not become shareholders of misbehaving companies in the first place.Plenty of fund managers argue they are trying to ""reform from within"" while happily accepting bumper dividend pay outs from companies in some of the most controversial sectors - such as oil and tobacco.Legal & General insist they are prepared to do that and last year issued a list of companies whose shares they decided to dump. The list of eight included Russian oil company Rosneft, the China Construction Bank and Subaru.Legal & General say that all eight of those on the ""black list"" have been in touch to try and get themselves off it. Proof positive, say L&G, that their brand of shareholder engagement - or disengagement - really works.Many in the UK might find that argument more convincing if the list of no-go investments included companies closer to home that would REALLY feel the cold shoulder of the UK's biggest money manager.For example, Royal Dutch Shell is the UK's biggest dividend payer by miles - offering investors a tempting 5.8% return on their money. Legal & General say they were successful in moving the chief executive's performance targets to be based on safety and environmental improvements rather than raw profit. They were less successful in tackling the sheer amount he pocketed last year - a colossal £17m.Roger Harrabin, environmental analystFor decades, many firms have paid lip service to climate change without substantially altering the way they do business.Then investors joined the climate campaign and began applying pressure from within.Their message is that acting on climate change isn't just a feel-good - it's a necessity to protect long-term assets.The Bank of England, for instance, recently warned that $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change.This alarming note is being amplified by fund managers who are pulling their investments out of fossil fuels.They include the World Council of Churches, the Rockefeller family and insurance giants AXA and Allianz.Collectively their portfolios are said to total about £7tn and they'll increasingly influence firms with discretion over their use of fossil fuels.But what about the massively-powerful fossil fuel giants whose very existence depends on mining those carbon compounds the world can't afford to burn?The slave trade was abolished only after traders were compensated for their ""loss of human property"".Will society need to compensate the oil majors for the assets they must leave underground?Asset managers are effectively the ""masters of the universe"" when it comes to telling companies how to behave as they have to vote on their investors behalf. But they have powerful customers of their own to answer to.Increasing numbers of pension fund trustees are seeking assurances that their employees' retirement contributions are not finding their way into embarrassing or inappropriate investments. The Church of England was not thrilled to find out its pension scheme was invested in the now defunct high cost credit company Wonga.More recently - and more importantly - was the decision by Norway's sovereign wealth fund to divest itself of some of its fossil fuel investments (paradoxically perhaps - the source of all the money in the first place).But what these examples show is that the savers and citizens, on whose behalf this money is managed, are becoming more aware - and more willing to object - about how that is done."
business	Huawei says latest US ban based on 'innuendo'	'Cautiously optimistic'	"US telecommunications regulators have declared Huawei and ZTE national security threats in the latest action by the US government against the Chinese tech giants.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has also proposed forcing US customers to replace equipment previously purchased from the firms.Huawei called the decision ""profoundly mistaken"".It said it was based on ""innuendo, and mistaken assumptions"".Huawei had made inroads in the US market, winning customers among rural telecommunications operators with relatively inexpensive network equipment.But US officials have increasingly raised concerns about ties between Chinese tech firms and their government in Beijing.In declaring Huawei and ZTE threats, the FCC on Friday cited the companies' ""close ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus"" and ""Chinese laws requiring them to assist with espionage"".The agency ordered that money from an $8.5bn aid programme to improve mobile and internet coverage in poor and underserved areas could not be used to buy equipment from firms deemed national security threats.Lobby group Rural Wireless Association said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" that members with Huawei or ZTE equipment will be able to comply with the order without disrupting service.The FCC has estimated that replacing the equipment would cost about $2bn.Huawei criticised the FCC's actions, saying they would have ""profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas across the United States.""It added that the FCC had presented ""no evidence that Huawei poses a security risk. Instead, the FCC simply assumes, based on a mistaken view of Chinese law, that Huawei might come under Chinese government control.""The US has alleged that Huawei's equipment could be abused for spying and urged other countries to bar Huawei from 5G networks,The White House placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in May citing national security fears. The move barred US firms from doing business without special approval.The Commerce Department had offered waivers, including for telecommunications firms in rural areas that relied on Huawei's equipment to continue to receive service."
business	What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters?		"Money laundering accounts for up to 5% of global GDP - or $2tn (£1.5tn) - every year, says the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. So banks and law enforcement agencies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help combat the growing problem. But will it work?Money laundering, so-called after gangster Al Capone's practice of hiding criminal proceeds in cash-only laundromats in the 1920s, is a huge and growing problem.""Dirty"" money is ""cleaned"" by passing it through layers of seemingly legitimate banks and businesses and using it to buy properties, businesses, expensive cars, works of art - anything that can be sold on for new cash.And one of the ways criminals do this is called ""smurfing"".Specialist software is used to arrange lots of tiny bank deposits that slip below the radar, explains Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, a financial crime AI provider headquartered in Israel.""A $0.25 transaction will never be spotted by a human, but transactions of that kind can launder $30m if they are done hundreds of millions of times,"" he says.And stolen money is often laundered to fund further criminal activity. One recent ATM (cash machine) scam cost banks €1bn (£854m) in total across 40 countries, for example.""The gang hacked into thousands of ATMs and programmed them to release up to five notes at a certain time - say 3am - at which point a local criminal or 'money mule' would pick it up,"" says Mr Gazit.""The money was then converted into Bitcoin and used to fund human trafficking.""""Money mules"" are often recruited to launder this gang cash through their legitimate bank accounts in return for a fee.""Estimates suggest that not even 1% of criminal funds flowing through the international financial system is confiscated,"" says Colin Bell, group head of financial crime risk at HSBC.And the problem seems to be getting worse, despite tightening regulations.In the UK alone, financial crime Suspicious Activity Reports increased by 10% in 2018, according to the National Crime Agency.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the BBC it was working on ""applied technical enhancements"" to its armoury of crime-fighting tools to help it keep up with advances in financial tech, but remains understandably tight-lipped on the details.However, other organisations are openly talking about their use of AI to fight the money launderers.More Technology of Business""AI that applies 'machine learning' can sift through vast quantities of transactions quickly and effectively,"" explains HSBC's Mr Bell.""This could be a vital tool for pinpointing suspicious activity.""For this reason, AI is good at spotting smurfing attempts and accounts that are set up remotely by bots rather than humans, for example.And it can also spot suspicious behaviour by corrupt insiders - a key element in many money laundering operations.""Using AI removes much of the risk of people deliberately overlooking suspicious activity,"" says Adam Williamson, head of professional standards at the UK's Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) - a professional body tasked with helping accountants avoid money laundering.Many of the world's biggest banks have been embroiled in money laundering scandals in recent years.Earlier this year, Swiss banking giant UBS was hit with a €3.7bn (£3.2bn) fine after being found guilty of helping wealthy clients in France hide billions of euros from tax authorities and launder the proceeds. It is appealing against the decision.Last year, Dutch bank ING paid out €775 million for failing to stop criminals laundering money through its accounts.And Danske Bank's boss was forced to quit over a €200bn money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch.In Latvia, too, the country's third largest bank ABLV Bank AS, was wound up after US authorities accused it of large-scale money laundering that had enabled its clients to violate nuclear weapons sanctions against North Korea.AI can crunch mountains of data in real time - emails, phone calls, expense reports - and spot patterns of behaviour humans might not notice across a global banking group.Once the system has learned legitimate behaviour patterns it can then more easily spot dodgy activity and learn from that.Regulators around the world are encouraging the new technology, perhaps in acknowledgement that they are losing the battle.US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth A. Blanco says: ""Financial institutions have been improving their ability to identify customers and monitor transactions by experimenting with artificial intelligence and machine learning.""FinCEN encourages these and other financial services-related innovations.""AI tech firms, such as ThetaRay, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Refinitiv, are offering businesses tools to tackle money laundering, but there are concerns that this presents its own problems.""If organisations are buying AI off the shelf, how can they convince regulators they are in control of it?"" asks the AAT's Adam Williamson.And as good as AI might be at spotting anomalies when sifting through huge swathes of data, it is only as effective as the data it is fed.So there is a growing recognition of the need for banks, financial institutions, governments, and law enforcement agencies to share more information.""Europol is designed to operate in partnership with law enforcement agencies, governmental departments and other stakeholders,"" says the agency's deputy executive director Wil van Gemert.""We embrace the idea of collective intelligence.""Mark Hayward, a member of the UK's new Economic Crime Strategic Board, set up in January, says: ""Data sharing is one of our main priorities"".And legislation has to keep up with the latest trends in financial services that criminals can exploit.The terrorists behind the 2016 Nice truck attack, for example, paid for the vehicles by pre-paid card to take advantage of the anonymity these cards afford the user.This is why the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive introduced last year includes digital currencies and prepaid cards for the first time.Given that the criminals appear to be winning, any tools that can help tackle the problem must surely be welcome.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook"
business	Why a timely nudge might help us save money	Can't save, won't savePrizes at the end of the tunnel	"Anyone struggling to save money might take inspiration from labourers in rural India.These low-paid construction workers took part in an experiment. When they were paid, some of the cash was put into one envelope, or two, and earmarked as savings.The stakes were raised for some when a picture of their children was attached to one of the envelopes.Dipping into those savings for everyday spending - by ripping through the image of their sons and daughters - made them feel guilty. So, as they tried to avoid this guilty feeling, the amount they saved increased.This is more than just a theory. In the UK today, millions of people set money aside in a separate savings account to stop them spending it day-to-day.Financial technology companies such as Wagestream, which allows workers to extract pay and save directly from their wages before payday, are trying out the use of reward and guilt.It allows users to load an image of their savings goal onto the app, such as a car or a holiday destination. The more they save, the clearer the image becomes. If they withdraw money, the picture starts to disappear.""It subtly reinforces the reality of what they are doing and can materially influence their behaviour,"" says Peter Briffett, co-founder of Wagestream.The reality, and the concern for many, is that the UK has lost its savings habit. This graph shows that experts are not expecting it to return any time soon.The proportion of income left after taxes that we save is known as the savings ratio. For the last couple of years, the UK has saved about 4% of disposable income. In the 1990s, it came close to 15%.The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government, predicts it will stay at or around this 50-year low for the next five years at least.It is not all bad. The OBR, the Bank of England, and others expect interest rates to stay low too. Many people are deciding to pay off debts when the costs are low, rather than save when the rewards (in interest payments) are low too.However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the increase in consumers' spending has outstripped any income growth in the last couple of years.A lack of savings has real consequences for the lives of millions of people - particularly the young and low-paid.No savings means no financial buffer for the unexpected - no way to pay when a deposit is needed to rent a home, or when the vet's bill lands after the cat is ill. or when the car breaks down. No car may mean no job.Data shows the extent of the problem:Free money offered by the government has done little to reverse the situation. The Help to Save scheme offers a 50% bonus to certain people on low incomes if they save for two or four years. Take-up has been below half the level expected by the OBR.So MAS, now called the Money and Pensions Service, wanted to find new ways to encourage people to save. It turned to the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), commonly known as the ""nudge unit"".In a tiny meeting room, one wall of which is entirely a whiteboard, sits someone with big ideas. Elisabeth Costa, is a director at BIT and leads a team of five trialling various projects aimed at encouraging those who are in work, but financially squeezed, to save.A total of 244 ideas about savings, guidance, and managing debts were thought up, before 17 were chosen for trials.In the end, many boil down to this: using timely reminders and automatic technology can help people manage their finances.We ""underestimate behavioural factors"", she says, which can be as powerful a motivator as, for example, an increase in the interest paid on savings.""The industry should make [customers'] decisions as easy and as automated as possible,"" she says.We make big changes at important times in our lives, so we might review our finances when we move home, or when children are born.Yet reminders can work on a more regular basis, if they are well-timed, according to Ms Costa. Research in Mexico showed three-quarters of workers whose wages were paid into their bank account immediately took the money out in cash. They received a message on pay day urging them to keep it in.One trial being planned in the UK is at supermarket check-outs, both physical and for online shoppers. The idea is that the shopper receives a message at the check-out asking whether they would like the equivalent of money saved from store discounts to be diverted automatically into a savings account.The team also plans to test the same theory with longer-term savings. This would prompt people to save some of their wages into a ""sidecar account"" alongside any pension savings. Employees would contribute in the same way as a pension, but the extra would go into a more easily accessible savings account for a rainy day, or to pay emergency bills.Other trials are planned or already in operation to help people pay off debt quicker, or block spending on gambling sites.Ms Costa explains that when it comes to finances, people often display ""tunnelling"" behaviour, when their short-term decisions clash with their long-term interests. For example, someone squeezed for cash may borrow a payday loan rather than save the same amount by switching to a cheaper energy deal.We also tend to value rewards that are offered today rather than in the long-term.That is why prize-linked savings accounts are popular. One study in South Africa found savings increased by 38% when people were offered the chance to win a cash prize rather than being paid interest.In the UK, Premium Bonds have been attracting people in much the same way for 60 years. It is the most popular savings product in the country. Yet, Ms Costa argues that for some people on low incomes, the £25 minimum investment may be too expensive.Many will argue that the financially squeezed need a little more help, as well as a little more luck."
business	HS2 review criticised by deputy chair of panel	'Locked in a vault'?What is HS2?	"Opponents of the HS2 high-speed railway linking London and the north of England say the government's review of the project is set to be a whitewash.The deputy chair of the HS2 review panel, Labour peer Lord Berkeley, says he has been given no opportunity to influence the final report.He is a vocal critic of the project.The government says it has been clear no panel member would have a veto, and that it would be inappropriate to pre-empt the recommendations of the review.Lord Berkeley also speculated that publication of the review has been put on hold until after the general election and the appointment of a secretary of state for transport.In a tweet, he said: ""My role as dep chair of the Oakervee Report on HS2 finished yesterday. Report not finished and no opportunity to influence conclusions.""We are told that, when completed by Doug O [Oakervee] and the DfT secretariat, it will be locked into the DfT vaults for the new S of S [secretary of state] to publish.""A spokesman for the Department for Transport would not confirm when the report would be published, telling BBC News the ""Oakervee review will conclude in the autumn"".Lord Berkeley, a civil engineer who worked on the construction of the Channel Tunnel, was a surprise appointment when Transport Secretary Grant Shapps launched the review back in August.This summer it emerged that the scheme was well over budget and behind schedule.The government has previously argued that its appointment of a well-known critic of HS2 as deputy chair of the review panel showed it was a genuine exercise and that it was considering all options.Those options included even scrapping the project, which will cost the taxpayer at least £88bn.But in recent weeks sources involved with, or close to, the review have told me Lord Berkeley was, in private, very unhappy about the way the process was being handled.Now he has gone public.In his tweet, Lord Berkeley said his role on the review had finished without him being given any opportunity to contribute to the final conclusions.Opponents of the scheme claim the review, which probably won't be published now until after the election, will be ""a whitewash"".They have long questioned the independence of the man leading the review, Douglas Oakervee - given that he himself is a former Chairman of HS2, the public company running the project.In September, Transport Minister Grant Shapps said the first phase of the HS2 high-speed railway between London and Birmingham would be delayed by up to five years.That section of the line was due to open at the end of 2026, but it could now be between 2028 and 2031 before the first trains run on the route.HS2's total cost has also risen from £62bn, and the second phase has also been delayed.That route - from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds - was due to open in 2032-33, but that has been pushed back to 2035-2040.In August, the government said it planned to review the costs and benefits of the rail project, with a ""go or no-go"" decision by the end of the year.The government has said that construction work will continue while the review is ongoing.Concerns that rising costs and delays could threaten the viability of HS2 are not new. Documents seen by the BBC in the autumn showed that both the government and HS2 knew the high speed railway was over budget and probably behind schedule years ago.HS2 is a new railway line which, once completed, would run from London to the West Midlands, Manchester and Leeds.Trains on the London to Birmingham route would be 400m-long (1,300ft) with up to 1,100 seats and would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 250mph. They would run as many as 14 times per hour in each direction.The Department for Transport says the project will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes.Once the second phase is complete, Manchester to London journeys would take one hour seven minutes (down from two hours seven minutes), and Birmingham to Leeds would take 49 minutes (down from two hours).This would effectively reduce journey times between London and Edinburgh and London and Glasgow by an hour, to three-and-a-half hours.The government hopes its creation will free up capacity on overcrowded commuter routes."
business	Cybertruck: Tesla truck gets 150,000 orders despite launch gaffe		"Tesla has received almost 150,000 orders for its new pickup truck, boss Elon Musk has said, despite an embarrassing hiccup at its launch.Mr Musk was caught out on stage when the windows of the Cybertruck shattered during a demonstration supposed to show their durability.Tesla shares dived 6.1% after the event on Thursday and several bad reviews.With its distinct angular design, the electric truck was greeted with cheers but also bemusement.But on Saturday Mr Musk tweeted: ""146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor"".The demand had come despite ""no advertising & no paid endorsement"" for the truck, he said.No date has been given for the Cybertruck's release, but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest.The industrial-looking vehicle is covered in stainless steel alloy and will be able to go from 0 to 100km/h (62 mph) in about three seconds, Mr Musk said in his presentation in Hawthorne, California.However, some analysts are concerned about the futuristic design, with Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds' vehicle marketplace saying: ""It looks like a truck version of the DeLorean from Back To The Future.""The launch event's ""fail"" happened during a segment displaying how the truck's stainless steel exterior, and metal windows, could withstand bullets and sledgehammers.Tesla's head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, proceeded to throw a metal ball at the front left window, causing it to smash.He repeated the move on the rear left window and the same thing happened. Mr Musk was heard to swear before joking: ""Room for improvement.""On Friday Tesla's share price dived by 6%, slashing Mr Musk's personal net worth by $768m (£598m) in a single day, according to Forbes.The pickup market represents a significant opportunity for Tesla as it improves its battery technology, meaning carrying heavier loads over long distances is now practical.According to vehicle marketplace Edmunds, large trucks have accounted for 14.4% of new vehicle sales in the US up until October, compared to 12.6% in 2015."

'All hype''Best value'	"Black Friday sales offer few real deals with most goods cheaper or available for the same price at other times, according to consumer group Which?.It found that just four of 83 products they studied last year were cheaper during the Black Friday promotion.Among products cheaper outside of Black Friday were a tumble dryer, smart speaker, coffee maker and TV soundbar.Which? home products and services chief Natalie Hitchins said shoppers should do research and never impulse buy,The consumer group tracked the products on Black Friday last year - 23 November. The items, from retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, and John Lewis, were monitored six months before the date and six months after.Just four products were cheaper on Black Friday than at other times of the year. Six in 10 items were cheaper or the same price on at least one day in the six months prior to last year's Black Friday event.When looking at the two-week period surrounding Black Friday itself - including sale prices in the week before and after - it was found that three quarters of products were cheaper or the same price in the six months after.Promotions included:While Which? did not find evidence that any of the retailers were breaking the law, the consumer group said it showed that so-called deals may not be all they are claimed.Ms Hitchins said: ""We have repeatedly shown that deals touted by retailers on Black Friday are not as good as they seem. Time-limited sales can be a good opportunity to bag a bargain, but don't fall for the pressure tactics around Black Friday.""Our investigation indicates that this popular shopping event is all hype and there are few genuine discounts,"" she said.Retailers rejected suggestions consumers were being misled and said that shoppers were getting some of the best deals of the year.Amazon said: """"The claim from Which? with regard to Echo is false and we have made this clear in our response to them. Amazon.co.uk customers were not able to buy the Echo (2nd gen) device cheaper before Black Friday 2018.""It added that its Black Friday sale was about ""thousands of deals on a huge selection of products from every category across the site, at a time of year when we know saving money is important to our customers"".Currys PC World told Which?: ""Our customers tell us that they appreciate the increased choice during Black Friday where we have the most deals on at once. When we launched our Black Friday event last year, 40% of those products were the lowest price they had ever been.""And John Lewis said: ""In addition to the variety of offers we have in-store and online during the Black Friday period, our commitment to being 'Never Knowingly Undersold' means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year.""Which?'s advice for consumers during this year's sales bonanza is:"
business	Huawei: Trouble overseas but boom time in China		"Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.More than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.His apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.""I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work,"" says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.His obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.A year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.Now he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.In October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.""4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet,"" he says.But in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.Industry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market.""The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies,"" he says.""As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying,"" Lee adds.Huawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.While western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.On 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.Huawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.The Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.And China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.On a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.Researchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China.They see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.""For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving,"" says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project.China is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.While Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US.Speaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism.""No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks,"" said Miao Wei.More Technology of BusinessIndustry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.""We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies,"" says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.""With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.""However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G."""
business	Farmers 'betrayed' by no-deal Brexit tariff plan	'Best prices'	"Farmers will feel ""betrayed"" by a government plan not to impose tariffs on the majority of goods entering the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the National Farmers Union has said.The government has announced it will not tax 88% of imports into the UK.The NFU said without a Brexit deal its members face tariffs on exports while overseas rivals will not be taxed.""The prime minister has missed a real opportunity to back British farmers,"" said NFU chief Minette Batters.The government published its updated proposed tariff regime ahead of the UK's scheduled departure from the European Union on 31 October.The regime, which will apply for the first year after the UK leaves the EU, contained three amendments including adjusting tariffs on bioethanol imports.Also some clothing shipped into the UK will be taxed at between 8% and 12%.Both revisions are aimed at protecting domestic bioethanol and clothing producers from cheaper imports.Earlier this year, the government said it would introduce tariffs on some meat and dairy products shipped into the UK following a no-deal Brexit.However, its latest plans indicate 88% of UK imports will be tariff-free if the country leaves the EU without a deal, up from 87% announced in March.Ms Batters said: ""We will see, from day one, farm businesses facing new, high tariffs on much of the 60% of our exports that go into the EU, while tariffs on goods coming into the UK will be set far, far lower and in many cases won't be applied at all.""She added: ""Farmers are going to feel betrayed by this government's failure to act now in making sure that all that can be done is being done to help mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit.""Dairy UK, the trade body, said it had told the government earlier this year that ""this major liberalisation did not offer the level playing field this industry needs to survive"".""Our preference is a deal,"" said Dairy UK's chief executive Judith Bryans. ""One which allows us to have open frictionless trade with our largest export customer, the EU.""If that doesn't happen, the government needs to impose reciprocal tariffs to level the playing field and put in place a package of mitigation measures, before businesses are pushed to the wall.""Trade Policy Minister Conor Burns, said: ""Our temporary tariff regime will support the UK economy as a whole, helping British businesses to trade and opening up opportunities for business to import the best goods from around the world at the best prices for British consumers.""Free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute said: ""British farmers can compete with the rest of the world on price and quality, they shouldn't be crying betrayal at the prospect of ministers no longer taxing British consumers for daring to buy things from abroad.""Freer trade was a key benefit of Brexit, and we should celebrate the removal of tariff barriers across the economy.""The Department for International Trade also announced on Tuesday that a proposed 22% tariff on lorries sold into the UK would fall to 10%.Lorries sold to the UK are currently not subject to a tariff, something the Road Haulage Association said should continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said: ""The original proposal of a 22% tariff on HGVs coming in from the EU was unbelievable.""A 10% tariff will still be crippling and will severely damage the lives and livelihoods of those responsible for operating the very industry that keeps the UK fit to live in.""Commenting on the change to lorry import taxes, Meredith Crowley, an economist specialising in international trade from the University of Cambridge, said the UK's heavy goods vehicle sector was facing ""some difficulty with Brexit"".She said: ""They were trying to have the same high tariffs on imports from the European Union but that could also raise prices for purchasers of heavy goods vehicles.""""These vehicles are really expensive, so £85,000 to £100,000.""Meanwhile, a government paper on Monday found UK and EU firms would be faced with a ""a significant new and ongoing administrative burden"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.It found large firms importing and exporting at scale would need to fill in forms taking one hour 45 minutes on average and cost £28 per form for each load imported.Separately, in a new 155-page ""Brexit readiness report"", the government said that a new advice service to help suppliers of medical goods would be launched."
business	‘I don’t have any hope for my future in Hong Kong’	Slow wage growthHomes out of reachLack of political will	"""I entered university to get a better life, but I don't have hope for my future,"" 20-year-old Dicky Cheung tells me.Dicky and his friends are students, but behind their camaraderie and carefree smiles lies an anxiety about their futures.They met me in the Mongkok district of Hong Kong and over a dinner of salty spinach and squid, I heard stories of frustration and futility.Dicky is studying to be a teacher and wants to be the main breadwinner for his family.But he doesn't think that's possible, because once he graduates from university he says he's unlikely to get a good job - or any job at all.""I want to change my family's life. In Hong Kong they have to work hard to pay the high rent,"" he told me, the emotion spilling out of his eyes.""Now when I grow up I cannot do that. The job vacancies are lower than before [and] when we graduate in three years the situation [will be] much lower.""For 18-year-old Leung Suet Lam, the picture is much the same.""When I graduate, I think I'll live with my family,"" she tells me. ""It is very difficult to get a flat here... buying is not realistic.""The structure of Hong Kong's houses are also very small - I will spend a lot of money to buy a small flat and that will limit the imagination of my life.""Young people like Dicky and Leung are grappling with three big economic challenges: wages aren't rising, the job market is increasingly competitive, and property prices are surging.While the reasons for the political protests are complex, and aren't to do with buying a home or getting a job, many young people in Hong Kong feel ignored by decades of poorly-planned government policies.That's fuelled their resentment of a system they feel is working against them.Competition for a place in one of Hong Kong's top universities is fierce, but even if you do get a spot and graduate, a good job or stable income isn't guaranteed.Increasingly, Hong Kongers are also competing for jobs with Chinese students.Chan Wai-Keung, a lecturer at Hong Kong Polytechnic, says in the 1990s, the salary starting point of fresh graduates was around HK$25,000 ($3,188; £2,594). Nowadays he says it is maybe just HK$28,000.Mr Chan published a report looking at wage growth and living costs for Hong Kong's youth over the last 30 years.He found that while starting salaries have stagnated, property prices have gone up tenfold.""Our education programme is old fashioned,"" Mr Chan told me. ""Our economy is dominated by a handful of powerful families, who made a fortune in the property market. They are reluctant to invest in high tech industries or innovative ideas.""Our government pays lip service to the high-tech development. Even if young people want to get into this new industry there's not a lot of good chances for them.""Those bleak job prospects have meant that things like buying a home are out of reach for most Hong Kongers, except for the lucky few - like Karide Chow.A tech worker with an international firm in the city, she borrowed money from her mother to buy a flat with her brother.""It's quite difficult to own a home in Hong Kong and the prices of the apartments [kept] rising in the past few years,"" she tells me. ""That's why we chose to buy the flat this year, because the prices will keep going up.""Her flat set her back more than $500,000 and measures a tight 276 sq feet (25 sq m).She, her brother and her boyfriend will all live in it together - something that she says is not unusual because of how costly property is here.Hong Kong is one of the most expensive places in the world to own a home according to UBS's Real Estate Bubble Index.Prices have doubled since 2008, and according to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics department, less than half of Hong Kong's households owned their own home in 2017, the lowest figure in 20 years.Public housing estates were meant to be the solution, but there aren't enough of them.Part of the problem is that property developers who are holding onto unused land banks aren't incentivised to build public housing.""If they develop [the land] into residential housing on a private basis, they fetch ten times as much,"" Stanley Wong, the former chairman of Hong Kong's Taskforce on Land Supply tells me.""For public rental housing - they would then lower the profit to roughly about five times as much. Land supply in any nation is the government's responsibility.""I must say in the last ten or fifteen years the government hasn't been bold enough to make sure that we will meet land supply in the medium term.""Hong Kong has one of the lowest tax rates in the world, which has helped it become a major financial hub.Those low tax rates though have meant that the government has had to find other ways to fund education, housing and health programmes.Traditionally it has relied on revenue from land sales to developers for commercial projects - but that means there's little incentive for the government to free up land for public housing.The other issue is the complicated makeup of Hong Kong's legislative council, the 70-member body that votes on how public money should be spent. It's dominated by business groups who have typically voted in their own interests.Hong Kong was a city built for business. But while businesses thrived, others were left out.A lack of government planning has contributed to the highest inequality rate in Hong Kong in 45 years.The government now recognises it needs to fix things - but it may be too little, too late."
business	Farm troubles raise risk for Trump in trade talks	Lost ground	"When Derek Sande returned from college almost a decade ago to run his family's 10,000-acre farm in Montana, the industry was feeling flush.But falling prices and a string of natural disasters have pummelled farmers in recent years, with the US-China trade war delivering a final punch.This autumn, Sande Farms declared bankruptcy.The filing was a first for his family, which has worked the land in America's northwest plains for at least four generations. But Mr Sande is hardly alone in his predicament.Across the country, farm bankruptcies have surged 24% since September 2018, a few months after US trade disputes with China and other countries led to higher tariffs on key farm goods including soyabeans, cotton and dairy, according to analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation.In the US, bankruptcy provides an opportunity to reorganise debt with the aim to continue operating. But outside of court, the trends are also troubling, with debt at record levels, late payments rising and the number of farms continuing to fall.The distress is a potential problem for US President Donald Trump, who won the White House with strong backing from farming states and is up for re-election next year.While polls suggest support for the president among farmers remains strong, the situation is not without risk.Approval has proven sensitive to shifts in US trade talks - in particular with China. Exports of US agricultural products to China have dropped by more than half since the start of the fight.The wave of bankruptcies has also hit especially hard in politically important states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - which supported Mr Trump in 2016 by narrow margins.In Wisconsin, a hub of dairy production, the number of bankruptcies is higher than any other state and the total number of farms has fallen 10% as families sell or go out of business, says Kevin Bernhardt, farm management specialist at the Center for Dairy Profitability at the University of Wisconsin-Extension.So far, farmers have been willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt, but ""whether that patience is going to last until next November, I'm not certain,"" he says.At a press conference last month, Mr Trump promised farmers that relief was on its way, in the form of a ""phase one"" deal with China, which would commit to more than double its purchases of US agricultural goods, to potentially $50bn a year.But a signing date has yet to be announced and reports suggest Chinese leaders have baulked at such a concrete commitment. Even within the White House, it's not clear if there's support for a deal without Chinese concessions on issues such as intellectual property theft, which triggered the fight.For farmers like Mr Sande, any deal may be too little, too late.""To me, it looks like we're going to be lucky to get back to where we were pre-tariff,"" he says. ""So is that going to make up the ground that we've lost?""The US exported nearly $20bn (£15bn) worth of agricultural products to China in 2017. That figure fell to $9.1bn last year, after China imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on a range of US goods, including apples, soybeans, ginseng and cotton.Some products have fared better than expected. Pork exports, for example, have held up, after a devastating outbreak of disease at Chinese pig farms.That hasn't helped Mr Sande, whose crops include soybeans, wheat and chickpeas. These crops are among the US exports to China that have dropped precipitously, as Chinese buyers head to Brazil and other countries for alternative suppliers.Nationwide, the pain is nowhere near as severe as it was during America's 1980s farm crisis, when thousands of farms went under. About 600 farms have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the 12 months to September out of roughly two million across the country, according to the Farm Bureau.But the trade disputes have worsened longstanding strains, after five years of sliding prices triggered by a global boom in production.""There's just no margin,"" Mr Sande says.The White House has announced some $28bn in aid for farmers affected by the tariffs and Mr Trump recently promoted plans for another round of payments on Twitter.The administration, worried about the 2020 campaign, is actually over-compensating many farmers for their losses, says Vincent Smith, a professor of agriculture at Montana State University and visiting scholar at conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, who has studied the programmes.""Many commentators appear puzzled why rural support among the farm sector appears to have remained high but... there is a ready explanation for the paradox,"" he says.Almost 40% of farm profits this year are expected to come from federal assistance, including the trade programme, according to the American Farm Bureau.But the payments have stirred controversy as the biggest, richest farms - including some foreign-owned firms - collect a majority of the relief. Lobby groups also maintain farmers want markets, not subsidies.Mr Sande, who received some aid, called it ""a nice gesture"". ""However, it really does not make up for a lot of it.""Congress, responding to the stress, recently made farms with debts of up to $10m eligible to use the specialised farm bankruptcy process - more than doubling the former limit.Mr Sande says he is hopeful that he will be able to reorganise his debts quickly and refocus on farming.But even if Mr Trump secures a deal with China, low prices are likely to linger, since the fight has spurred other countries to boost their production, warns John Newton, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau, an industry lobby group.""Once you expand soybean acres in South America or expand cotton acres in South America or expand pork production in Europe, those don't turn off with a switch,"" he says. ""It's just going to be that much more competitive."""
business	Dubai Air Show: The challenges for us all in flying green		"Sustainable, renewable, green: the buzz words of the environmentalists figured large at this week's Dubai Air Show. At the last show two years ago, such things barely registered.This time we've had airline Etihad rename a Boeing 787 Dreamliner a ""greenliner"" and Airbus unveiling an experiment in which aircraft follow each other to reduce drag and save fuel. It mimics bird flight.No press conference seems complete without a reference to aviation efficiency, and the president of Emirates airline even praised activist Greta Thunberg for helping focus minds on what they had to do.Trouble is, not only does aviation contribute 2% of global emissions, that figure is set to rise over the next few years. No wonder critics reject aviation's pledge to become sustainable as hollow.So, have we seen ""greenwash"" in Dubai or a genuine commitment to change? What are airlines doing to help tackle the climate crisis? And can the industry really wean itself off fossil fuels?The BBC's Talking Business programme went to the air show to speak to experts involved in aviation's attempt to clean up its act.Aero-engines are at the heart of the issue, of course. While critics are quick to condemn the industry's rising emissions, things would be so much worse without advances in engine technology, says Phil Curnock, chief engineer, civil future programme at Rolls-Royce (RR).""We have come a long way,"" he says. ""Engines are some 50% more efficient than 30 years ago."" That may be little consolation when airlines are still chucking more emissions into the atmosphere. But it is illustrative of the impact new technologies can make, he says.For example, the firm's new UltraFan, set for commercial use in the next decade, is one of the biggest leaps in engine technology for 50 years. ""And once you've got the latest gas turbine on your aircraft, the next thing to do is look at the fuel you're burning,"" he says.Commercial airlines are forecast to use about 97bn gallons of jet fuel this year, a record. But, says Alejandro Rios Galvan, a bioenergy expert and professor at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, there is simply no alternative available in the short term.He believes plant based bio-fuels currently offer the best option. ""These have the capacity to reduce the carbon footprint anywhere between 50-80% when you compare them to fossil.""Bio-fuels are already being used in very small quantities. All flights from Los Angeles and Oslo, for example, carry a tiny bio-fuel mix. But there are many issues around price and production of this fuel.A problem is that airlines operate on wafer thin profit margins. They are not going to adopt anything that increases their cost base, he says. But he adds: ""The costs [of bio fuels] have come down significantly as more infrastructure is built to refine these products. It may only be a few years before they can compete on par basis with cost of fossil fuel.""One route is to get rid of fuels completely, or perhaps combine them in electric hybrid engines. It's not an option for huge long-haul airliners. But for smaller aircraft covering perhaps 1,000 miles ""electrification is a really good opportunity,"" says Mr Churnock. ""It offers the possibility of a carbon neutral flight for a limited range.""Airbus has been a leader in electric development. Sandra Bour Schaeffer, the European plane maker's head of demonstrators, said that every tonne of fuel saved means a saving of three tonnes of CO2 emissions. ""So it is absolutely crucial that work is done on the electric engine side.""And the industry is getting close to real commercial breakthrough technology, Ms Bour Schaeffer said. In 2015, Airbus' E-Fan all-electrical aircraft crossed the English Channel on 60 kilowatts of power.In 2021 the company's E-FanX hybrid electrical aircraft will use two megawatts. ""It's a huge improvement,"" she said. ""It's about learning and stretching the technology.""And yet, these developments are only medium to long-term solutions. Ms Bour Schaeffer doesn't foresee commercial electric aircraft flying until the mid-2030s. The aviation industry has committed to halving emissions by 2050. With air travel set to double over the next 20 years, that target looks a tall order.But just because big breakthrough technologies are years away does not mean nothing can be done in the short term, the BBC's expert panel say.There are multiple improvements being made: better aircraft aerodynamics, changes to ways aircraft taxi on runways, use of lighter materials, improvements to airspace use to allow more straight-line flying and reduce holding patterns.An Airbus project called ""Fello'fly"" will experiment with aircraft flying behind each other. The idea is that the trailing aircraft flies in the updraft of the one in front, allowing it to reduce engine thrust. Sound fanciful? Ms Bour Schaeffer says this pairing of aircraft can save 5-10% in fuel.Mr Curnock points to another easy win. If an aircraft descends into an airport at constant rate it can save about 150 kilograms of carbon. ""These are really simple things that can be done through good air traffic control. They can have an impact in the short term while we are developing the bigger harder-hitting technology.""Such things don't necessarily make good headlines. But cumulatively they can make a difference. The issue for aviation, though, is whether it's enough in the short term to stave off taxation, regulation, protests and ""flight shamers"" until the industry can prove its long term solutions are working."
business	Trump speaks to 'his people' on Wall Street		"By the reckoning of most economists, Donald Trump is engaged in a risky game, as he courts trade fights around the world, undermines the US central bank and runs up the national debt.None of that seems to matter too much to Wall Street.The US president got a warm welcome in New York on Tuesday, where he spoke before a crowd of 1,350 hosted by the Economic Club of New York.Assorted whistles filled the room when his name was announced. Big applause followed his claim to have delivered and exceeded his campaign promises.""Thank you,"" he said. ""I was waiting for that. I almost didn't get it.""It soon became clear that he needn't have worried.""I think he felt comfortable with the crowd. It's his people,"" said one member of the audience, who works in New York property.Tuesday's speech was, in the words of that man, ""classic Trump"" - an hour-long monologue that covered familiar topics, including the rise in the US stock market and US trade policy.Mr Trump mixed prepared text touting his administration's accomplishments - primarily tax cuts and environmental deregulation - with his own asides, often digs at Democrats.Audience members - who were primarily white and male - afterward deemed the talk ""articulate"" and ""very inspirational"".""I truly believe he's working for the American people, not himself,"" one man said.Those listening in hope of gleaning some intelligence on US-China trade talks were bound to be disappointed. A deal is close, the president said, as he has before.But those there for the selfie, cheesecake and general spectacle probably came away satisfied.""Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators - I meet 'em all,"" Mr Trump said, drawing a gasp of disbelieving laughter.The audience listened with equanimity as Mr Trump spoke about reviving the manufacturing sector and reversing America's losing record before the World Trade Organization (WTO).In fact, while the US manufacturing sector has added jobs, their numbers remain lower than they were before the financial crisis. And the US has a long-standing record of winning the vast majority of cases it brings before the WTO.Mr Trump also took the opportunity to criticise the Federal Reserve, which recently cut interest rates. Mr Trump said the bank should go further, pointing to even lower rates overseas.Those jibes got big applause.Mr Trump also seemed confident about the upcoming election. After all, Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren want tougher climate policies and higher taxes on billionaires.""The truth is, you have no choice,"" he told the crowd of dark suits. ""Because the people we're running against are crazy.""He added of his election prospects, as he prepared to exit the stage: ""I think we're going to do very well. We're going to do it easily."""

business	Scenting an opportunity	Disability Works	"India has a large blind population. According to government data, more than five million people in the country are visually impaired.Finding employment is always a challenge for them but there might be new hope with a company that's come up with a novel idea to train up those who cannot see.Peak rush hour for Mumbai's suburban railway system is 7.30am. An overcrowded train pulls on to an equally packed platform. A swarm of people jump out and there's a mad rush to exit the station.At the far end of the platform though, there's one coach that people are still struggling to get off before the train leaves.It's the compartment for disabled people.Ravi Vanniyar feels around with his white cane, and gingerly steps down on to the platform. Once he's off the train, he walks much more confidently.This is a daily routine. Ravi is blind after losing his eyesight due to a smallpox infection at the age of three.Outside the station, a bus owned by his employer is waiting to drop him and other staff off to their workplace.Ravi has a job at a factory that produces raw material that goes into producing perfumes and fragrances. He's required to smell the material and check its quality. His company, Anthea Aromatics, also employs another visually impaired person.Ravi's previous job was selling cutlery at railway stations. ""It was a struggle. Sometimes I would make no sales and had to go hungry. Then there were instances when my stock would be stolen because I cannot see.""Then, three years ago he found out that a company was inviting people who couldn't see to test their sense of smell.CPL Aromas, an international fragrance firm whose headquarters is in the UK, had carried out a study in India where it found that visually impaired people were better at identifying smells than the general population.It began to train blind people, teaching them industry names for different kinds of fragrances. Ravi passed the course and got a job at Anthea.Mathew Menacherry, the company's business development head, says they initially did it as charity, but now see the business sense in the decision.""These people can really contribute. They really have a superior sense of smell, which even from a business perspective is very valuable to us because it's a rare commodity.""In a laboratory in another part of Mumbai, one more batch of blind students is being trained. On long, granite-topped tables, bowls of fruit and Petri dishes filled with spices are laid out. Six blind people are being taught how to identify different smells by two teachers.They all pick up sticks of cinnamon, and hold them close to the nose for a couple of minutes. ""What do you smell?"" asks the teacher. One reports the scent of a ""woody note"".""According to me, these students are a step ahead of people who can see,"" says Renuka Thergaonkar, who runs the course. But she adds that there are challenges convincing blind students to finish the training. There are many dropouts.""They come to us with a lot of psychological baggage. Secondly, they also have financial issues. It becomes difficult for them to manage learning as well as earning money for their families,"" she says.Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in businessMore Disability storiesIn India, laws mandate that at least 3% of government jobs should be reserved for people with disabilities. But these are often difficult to get, and there aren't enough of them. So, disabled people are often left to fend for themselves when it comes to finding employment.In recent years, the private sector has become more inclusive. Many companies have started hiring blind people as telephone operators.But a job that uses a skill which visually impaired people might be better at than those who can see could be a game changer.Six fragrance companies have so far recruited blind students from the course. But it's still not easy convincing firms to take them on.""It's very challenging. We literally have to go door-to-door and ask industry to employ them,"" says Sheetal Desai, India director of CPL Aromas.""They wonder how visually impaired people will get to work, what kind of support the company needs to give - those are the apprehensions.""Ravi requires very little help to get around. He has a long commute to work, using public transport, which is not very disabled-friendly in India. But the promise of a white-collar job and a salary at the end of each month is what keeps him going.""I feel proud. I'm earning my own money and because of that my children are progressing,"" he says. ""When I was a hawker, people would behave very badly with me. Now everyone at my workplace treats me with respect.""I'm living with dignity."""
business	Australia and others ask for Brexit trade compensation	Brexit delaysIreland question	"Countries including Australia have asked for trade compensation from the UK and the EU over Brexit disruption.Fifteen countries, including the US, India and New Zealand, have been setting out Brexit concerns at a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Geneva.Australian officials said their beef and lamb exporters had already been hit after several Brexit delays.Brazil said Brexit plans for Northern Ireland could breach WTO rules.The main issue for the 15 countries is a system which allows them easier access to the EU's large market for limited quantities of some of their goods, mainly farm produce.It's a system known as ""tariff rate quotas"".World Trade Organization members generally apply tariffs - taxes on imports - to many of the goods they buy from abroad.For some products they have made commitments to allow specified amounts to be imported with tariffs that are lower than what they usually apply. In some cases the reduced tariff is zero.It makes it more profitable for Australian farmers to sell beef to Europe, for example.Brexit complicates this.The current quotas are for the whole of the EU, the UK included.Brexit means the UK and the EU have to decide how to divide them up.Some countries say that could lead to them having less of the favourable access than they currently have to what is a large and wealthy market.A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""We have set out our Goods Schedule at the WTO to maintain the existing balance of rights and obligations between the UK and our trading partners.""The UK has entered into negotiations with affected countries under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Article XXVIII process to maintain the current balance of rights and obligations.""Australia said that the UK and EU had proposed different ways of allocating the quotas that would add up to less access than Australian exporters currently have.The US argued that it could end up with no access at reduced tariffs for pizza cheese to the UK or grape juice to the EU.Another concern is that the UK and EU might themselves end up using part or even all of the other's quota.The US argued that could severely hit its sales of pork and wine.Some countries are demanding compensation from the UK and EU. In the WTO that would usually mean reducing tariffs on other goods.Australia also argued that it has already been affected by Brexit.A paper prepared for the meeting said that when Brexit was still scheduled for 31 October, many Australian businesses ceased exports of valuable beef and sheep meat ahead of Christmas because of uncertainty about whether they would be able to make use of these quotas.The document said similar decisions were taken ahead of a previous possible Brexit dates and will have to be taken again before 31 January.Brazil has raised another concern about the plans for customs procedures between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Brazilian officials said it could violate the WTO's rules against discrimination.The documents the BBC has seen don't spell out the reason for this, but it is probably based on the plans to have an open border between Northern Ireland in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in the EU.Combined with the plans for limited checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, it might provide an opportunity for goods to travel between the UK and EU without restrictions or possibly tariffs that would apply to similar goods from the rest of the world.Brazilian officials said it was paramount that the WTO's non-discrimination principle is preserved.It was not clear, they argued, that the proposed arrangements for Northern Ireland would guarantee that would happen."
business	Virgin Media switches phone customers from BT to Vodafone	'Coup'	"Virgin Media is ditching telecoms group BT and switching its three million mobile phone customers to the network run by Vodafone.Customers are being promised a host of new services and will not have to change Sim cards, Virgin Media said.The cable group's current contract with BT, which owns the EE network, expires in 2021, although Virgin will launch 5G services with Vodafone before then.The contract is reportedly worth about £200m to BT, whose shares fell 4.7%.Virgin Media chief executive Lutz Schuler said: ""This agreement with Vodafone will bring a host of fantastic benefits and experiences to our customers, including 5G services in the near future.""Twenty years ago, Virgin Mobile became the world's first virtual operator and this new agreement builds on that heritage.""It will open up a whole new world of opportunity for Virgin Media as we focus on becoming the most recommended brand for customers and bring our mobile and broadband connectivity closer together in one package for one price.""We want our customers to have a limitless experience - it's now the right time to take a leap forward with Vodafone to grow further and faster.""Meanwhile, Vodafone UK chief executive Nick Jeffery said the deal combines ""two great British brands... combining our strong heritage in innovation"".Analyst Paolo Pescatore, from PP Foresight, said: ""For Vodafone, this is a great coup as it continues to turn around its fortunes in the highly competitive UK market.""Virgin Media is owned by US telecoms giant Liberty Global, which is also rumoured to be in talks with Sky to invest in a full-fibre network.Wednesday's Vodafone deal, along with any tie-up between Liberty and Sky, raises the competitive pressure on BT, which is investing heavily in upgrading its own network.A BT spokesperson said: ""The successful relationship between BT and Virgin Media spans nearly 20 years and they remain a highly valued customer.""Our EE network is consistently ranked number one for speed and coverage in independent benchmarking tests, providing our EE customers... with the UK's best mobile experience."""
business	Toy sales slump as shops chase Christmas cheer	UK toy market factsThe Brexit effect	"Caution among UK shoppers has led to a tough year so far for toy retailers, as parents search for deals and cut back on impulse buys.UK toy sales were down by 8% in the year so far, compared with the same period last year, leaving retailers dreaming of a bumper Christmas.But economic uncertainty and Brexit planning could lead to shortages of the most popular toys.Others may be sold off cheaper if sales fail to match retailers' expectations.About 30% of annual spending on toys comes at Christmas, with £86 spent on the typical child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD.The industry is banking on festive sales turning around a poor year so far. The 8% drop in UK sales was worse than a 3% drop in international toy sales, said Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for NPD. Sales last year were also flat, suggesting more than a seasonal downturn.She said this was driven by a lack of consumer confidence and High Street woes in general, rather than issues specific to the toy industry.Parents and grandparents have made fewer impulse buys outside of birthdays and Christmas, partly as they are less likely to be in stores.""You do not get the same Willy Wonka-type excitement on the internet as children do in a toy shop,"" said Gary Grant, who chairs the committee which selects the 2019 DreamToys list of ""must-have"" toys.Blockbuster film releases had been earmarked as a saviour for the industry this year, owing to the sale of spin-off toy merchandise which account for 10% of the market. The two brands which have previously broken records for film-licensed products - Star Wars and Frozen - will see new films released before Christmas.But Mr Grant said the financial reality for many families was that buying a toy after watching a film would be a substitute for another toy purchase, not necessarily an additional purchase.Source: NPDLicensed products in general have accounted for 23% of toy sales so far this year, but Ms Tutt said this sector was no longer dominated by blockbuster film releases.Some of the hotly tipped toys this year have links to YouTube stars and are marketed on social media. The fragmentation of entertainment channels has made it difficult for the big film brands to repeat previous success - although some, such as Harry Potter - have had some joy.""Children move on to the next thing very quickly, so there is a relatively short window of opportunity to make sales,"" she said.The extra planning required by the potential for the UK leaving the EU on 31 October led many manufacturers and retailers making early decisions on orders for the coming Christmas.That, according to Mr Grant, could mean a shortage of certain toys before Christmas which suddenly become popular. A cautious approach by manufacturers may add to this concern.However, there was also the chance that retailers could have over-ordered certain toys, leading to the potential for big discounts on those at some point before Christmas.That, he said, would impact the cash taken by retailers, in addition to the extra management time and cost during the year that was caused by Brexit planning.He predicted that a pick-up in the UK economy and consumer confidence would bring shoppers back to the High Street to spend money, but it was difficult to know when such an improvement would come."
business	Energy industry has 'opportunity' to address price cap	Some meritBrexit	"Energy suppliers have a ""window of opportunity"" to address government proposals for a cap on energy prices, according to Steve Holliday, the vice president of the Energy Institute.Mr Holliday said there was an opportunity ""to come back with some serious suggestions"".Last week's Queen's Speech appeared to water down commitments to a price cap.Instead it said ministers were ""considering the best way"" to protect those on the poorest-value tariffs.Before the election, the government had proposed intervening in the energy market to help millions of domestic gas and electricity customers by cutting around £100 off their energy bills.Last year, a landmark investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority concluded that many households on standard variable tariffs were paying too much for their energy.It calculated consumers were overpaying by up to £1.2bn a year and recommended a price cap for households using pre-payment meters.Several large suppliers have questioned the findings. But they have come under increasing political pressure for their treatment of loyal customers on standard tariffs.Mr Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, said the energy industry's reaction to the idea of a price cap was mixed.He was speaking at the launch of the Energy Institute's annual barometer, which gathers the views of industry members.The survey, completed by 466 members across the energy sector, indicates that that some see merits in a price cap to tackle affordability and poverty.But most respondents were against a cap. ""There were lots of people identifying the negative impact on investment, decarbonisation and on competition in the supply industry"" said Mr Holliday.""When you looked across the whole of the participants here... more than half were not in favour of a price cap,"" he added.The Energy Institute's barometer for 2017 also identified Brexit as a ""material concern"" to the energy sector.Members of the institute were concerned about uncertainty around energy policy, the availability of skilled labour, future trading arrangements, energy costs, security of supply and investment.""The stakes are high for the UK's energy economy"", said Mr Holliday.""Sound policy making should not be drowned out by Brexit or other political upheavals.""A majority of those who responded to the survey want to keep most EU directives enshrined in UK law.But a majority also want to see the UK abandon EU state aid rules and opinion is divided on British involvement in the EU emissions trading system.As part of its Brexit plans, the government has confirmed that the UK will also leave Euratom, the European nuclear treaty covering the safety and the transport of nuclear material.Energy professionals believe this move will negatively affect most aspects of the nuclear sector, including the cost and deliverability of new nuclear plants such as Hinkley Point C.A majority also view President's Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate Agreement as a ""material concern"", although one that can overcome by action at a state and federal level."
business	'I do my engineering in high heels not a hard hat'	Complex problem-solving	"The clichéd image of an engineer is of a man in a hard hat, but one female engineer says she is more likely to wear high heels to work.Pavlina Akritas is a lighting designer at multinational firm Arup, and she has been helping to highlight the lack of women in engineering.The Royal Academy of Engineering says many young people think of the work as technical and boring.It says that has left a skills shortage of about 50,000 people a year.At present just 12% of engineers are women, and 9% from an ethnic minority background. That is why the academy launched its This is Engineering Day to change stereotypes.Women in engineering: A changing industry?Women in construction: 'Take the leap into a new job'""If you google 'engineer' you only see these hard hats, but personally if I was asked how many times I wear a hard hat, it's probably two weeks per year,"" says Ms Akritas.""On other occasions, I wear my heels - I like my heels - and my dresses.""The globetrotter, who grew up in Cyprus before studying in the US and UK, says her job ""gives me an opportunity to work in many different countries"".She has also featured in the 100 Influential Women in Engineering list, drawn up by Inclusive Boards.The academy is now working with lots of big brands in the media, in advertising and recruitment to encourage ""more representative"" images of engineers.Hayaatun Sillem, chief executive of the academy, says the role is varied and that it is a ""well-paid profession"".""Engineering is a great foundation,"" she says. ""You're really employable if you're an engineer, so it's not surprising that people who study engineering go on to work in other areas.""That's great, we need people with those skills right across our economy,"" she adds. ""We also need enough of them going into engineering.""One of the main barriers to young people pursuing a career in engineering is a deeply-rooted cultural perception of the profession as mechanical, too technical and boring, an outdated view that is being reinforced online.But Michelle Hicks, a rollercoaster designer at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey, said the industry's grimy reputation was undeserved.""That's one of the biggest misconceptions. The role of an engineer is so varied,"" she said.""For me, it can be from going to design team meetings, complex problem-solving, to being out on site.""But when you're on site as an engineer, it's very much looking at what's going on, is it built to specification. It's not [about] getting dirty at all."""
business	Netflix says opportunity 'gigantic' despite slowing growth	Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco	"Netflix has grown slower than it expected in the first three months of the year, but insists that the opportunity for growth is ""gigantic"".The streaming firm added 4.95 million new subscribers in the quarter, fewer than the 5.2 million it had forecast.In the US, the firm added a third fewer new members than the same period a year ago, while overseas members fell 22%.Netflix blamed the drop partly on shifting some of its popular shows to the second quarter of the year.The firm said its House of Cards series, which last year debuted in the first quarter but for this year has been pushed into the second quarter, was the main reason for the lower-than-expected subscriber growth.Netflix said it still expected to add 8.15 million new members in total for the first half of the year, just below the 8.42 it added in the first half of last year.By this weekend, the firm said it expected to reach 100 million subscribers globally.""It's a good start,"" said chief executive Reed Hastings.He said that the growth of the global internet meant the opportunity for the firm was still ""gigantic"", and said the firm planned to continue investing in films and shows aimed at increasing its membership.""We have come to see these quarterly variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV,"" he added.As ever, Wall Street is obsessed with user growth above almost any other metric a technology company can offer.Netflix didn't add as many new users in the last quarter as investors had been expecting, both in the US and internationally.Aggressive marketing is still a huge part of Netflix's expenditure - $1bn expected this year - so it shows those new subscribers really aren't coming easy.But I think things will probably improve this year with the roll-out of the new seasons of House of Cards and Stranger Things, both blockbuster shows that represent the very best of their ""Originals"" brand.The firm increased revenues by over a third to $2.64bn for the quarter compared to the first three months of last year, while net income rose to $178m from $28m.Its shares fell in after-hours trading, dropping 3% with investors disappointed by the slower-than-expected growth.Netflix said it would continue to focus on original programming, aiming to ""please diverse tastes with a wide breadth of content"".The company started making its own shows in 2013, with House of Cards one of its first big hits and Stranger Things more recently. Netflix plans to spend more on original content this year and reduce outlays on licensed material such as movies."
business	Is 'hard Brexit' an opportunity for carmakers?	What Britain makes...and keepsOverseas dependence	"The boss of PSA Group, which is buying Vauxhall and Opel, says that a so-called hard Brexit could present ""an opportunity"" for the UK car industry.Carlos Tavares suggests that with potentially high tariffs in Europe, where carmakers could be forced to pay taxes on exports and imports to and from the European Union, it could become more cost-effective to have manufacturing plants in Britain to supply parts for UK-made cars.He reasons that such an approach would iron-out any volatility in the company's profits.""A hard Brexit with custom duties and all that stuff, then of course it would be an opportunity for us to have a UK sourcing to source for the UK,"" he says.""Of course for that to happen we also need to have the supplier base being devolved in the UK so that the cost structure would be in pounds, the revenue structure would be in pounds and therefore the sensitivity, the volatility on our profit would be lower.""But is the UK car market big enough to support its own components industry?There are 32 million cars on British roads. And although the UK is the third largest car producer in the European Union, after Germany and Spain according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), the vast majority of vehicles it makes are exported, while 86% of newly registered vehicles in the UK last year were imported.Of the 1.72 million cars made in the UK last year, 1.35 million were shipped overseas.According the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), 368,482 passenger vehicles were for the British market.In terms of British-made components, steps have been taken in recent years to increase the number used in UK cars which, on average, are made-up of 6,000 parts.According to the SMMT, the average content in a British-built vehicle has increased from 36% in 2011 to 41%. However, the majority still has to come from overseas suppliers.Another rather puzzling aspect to Mr Tavares's plan is that it appears to run counter to the PSA Group's 2.2bn euro takeover of Vauxhall and Opel.One of his main aims is to find cost ""synergies"" to improve profit margins. So the maker of Peugeot, Citroen, Opel and Vauxhall wants to share ""more assets, platforms, features and systems"".Mr Tavares adds that exporting will be key to the company's success.""For many, many years Opel/Vauhall could not export cars outside of Europe. That was something that General Motors didn't want them to do. PSA is going to unleash this potential, we are going to open the gates.""This will happen, he says ""soon as the Opel Vauxhall models are using the PSA IP [intellectual property] but, if his earlier statements on a hard Brexit are to be believed, different supply chains."
business	Zut alors! The Americans who are farming edible snails		"Taylor Knapp says that he finds snails ""fascinating"", which is probably for the best, given that he looks after as many as 70,000 of them.Mr Knapp is the founder and owner of the largest snail farm in the US, Peconic Escargot, based on Long Island, New York - there are just two such farms certified by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rear the molluscs for human consumption.He hand-delivers fresh snails (escargots in French) to restaurants in New York City, and is struggling to keep up with demand. He has seen annual sales double since first opening for business in 2017.The 31-year-old, who is also a chef, came up with the idea after tasting fresh snails for the first time while working in Europe. He says he realised that they tasted much nicer than the canned, pre-cooked varieties available in the US.However, it is illegal for US restaurants or food firms to import fresh snails, whether dead or alive, as they are considered to be a pest or invasive species. And the three main edible species are all native to Europe.But with trade figures showing that US consumption of snails rose 42% to 300 tonnes in 2018, he saw a business opportunity and decided to launch Peconic so US chefs could get their hands on fresh ones.But if you cannot import snails into the US, where was he to get his breeding stock from? Thankfully, he was able to buy some petit gris or little grey snails (one of the best species for eating) from a supplier in California.The descendants of these snails had set up home in California since 1850, after they were brought over to the US by a European immigrant. He or she had seemingly been able to sneak them past the US Customs service, which had been up and running since 1789.To launch Peconic, Taylor and his business partner raised $30,000 (£23,000) from a crowd-funding scheme and other investors. He then worked closely with the USDA to get regulatory approval.This includes making sure the greenhouse where his snails live is snail-proof, and that they cannot escape, however slowly. This includes an airlock door, all drain holes being grated, and the greenhouse being surrounded by gravel which is regularly sprayed with snail repellent. It is Alcatraz for snails.""It's a bit of an overkill,"" says Ric Brewer who owners the other USDA-approved snail farm - Little Gray Farms Escargotiere - in Washington state. He wonders whether understaffing at the USDA means that they have put in excessive rules.""The USDA is stretched for resources, they are stretched for inspectors,"" says the heliculturalist (someone who breeds and raises snails for eating).Ric's farm opened in 2011, and is home to up to 50,000 snails; as the name of his business suggests, he also specialises in the petit gris species.""As an animal, they have been around for more than 500 million years, and have a complicated life cycle for such a seemingly primitive creature,"" he says. ""As a culinary source, they are a very adaptable ingredient, and have a low environmental impact as livestock.""They are cooked just as you would clams, crabs or lobsters - put into a pot of boiling water, though I do hibernate them first in a refrigerator. They most likely don't even know what's happened.""Rick and Taylor both sell their snails raw, which means that they have to be kept chilled at all times, and have a shelf-life of just one week. This is a world away from canned snails, which can last for years if the tin is unopened.For their troubles, they can charge more twice as much for their snails.Chef Ryan Angulo sells Peconic snails at Brooklyn's French Louie restaurant. ""They have such a different flavour and texture [compared with the canned alternative],"" he says.""They are about the price of a local oyster. In the same vein, you should treat them as you would a fresh [cooked] oyster - cooked gently with ingredients that highlight its flavour.""Taylor says that he is aiming to expand sales beyond New York, and is looking at partnering with a seafood distributor so that his snails can stay nice and cold during transportation. Currently he sells up to 27kg (60lb) of snail meat a week.""We have saturated the New York market,"" he says. ""We need to be breaking out to some other east coast cities like Boston and Philadelphia.""However, as exporting is currently out of the question, as the USDA doesn't permit it, it means the two producers will have to wait before then can try to make a dent in the global market, with wholesale sales worth some $117m a year.""Snails are fascinating, but I don't find them to be loveable,"" says Taylor. ""I enjoy eating them, so to say that I love them would be a little much."""
business	Final day for Help to Buy Isa applications		The final providers of the Help to Buy Isa - aimed at saving for a first home deposit - will close the window for new applications on Saturday.The product, which has been available since December 2015, allowed potential first-time buyers aged 16 or over to save, with the income free from tax.This was then topped up with a government bonus of up to £3,000.Nearly 260,000 properties have been bought using the Isa across the UK, Treasury figures show.The data also revealed that 339,747 bonuses have been paid through the scheme, with an average value of £943. The biggest proportion was in the North West of England.On average, first-time buyers using the scheme are 28 - two years younger than the average age across all first-time buyers.The scheme will officially close to new accounts but account holders can keep on saving until autumn 2029, with bonuses needing to be claimed by 1 December 2030.A number of banks have already pulled their Help to Buy Isas, prompting a late surge, according to some providers.Rachel Springall, from financial information service Moneyfacts, said that if savers missed out on Help to Buy Isas there was the option of a Lifetime Isas, which also offered a government bonus.She said that with Lifetime Isas, savers might find they had less choice of deals and interest rates might also be lower.However, Laura Suter, from AJ Bell, said that the Lifetime Isa had a higher limit on property prices outside London, a larger potential government bonus, and the ability to save in both lump sums and monthly.
business	General election 2019: What are rent controls?	What are rent controls?Why do people want rent controls?More young people rent privatelyHas the UK ever had rent controls?Which cities around the world use them?Do rent controls always work?What could happen in the UK?	"Labour has pledged to bring in rent controls in England if it wins the general election.It is an idea that has been tried in many cities worldwide, but what is rent control and how does it work?There are a number of different ways to control rent.They can include setting a cap on the amount landlords can charge, or even freezing rents.Rent increases once a new tenancy is agreed could also be limited, and it could be made easier for people to stay on in a property.Rent controls can vary hugely in how they are implemented.For example, officials might choose to cap rent prices at the current market rate, or to set a lower limit if prices are high.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is calling for rent increases to be capped at the national inflation rate. He says areas with high rents would be able to make the case for more controls.The Conservatives have promised to ban Section 21 notices, which allow landlords to evict tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy ends.The cost of renting a property has been increasing in the UK, but wages have been struggling to keep up.In London, average monthly private rents increased by 35% from £1,095 in 2011 to £1,473 in 2018. Many young people in the capital are spending more than half of their income on rent, a study by PwC suggested.Young people have been particularly affected across the country, because 25 to 34-year-olds make up the largest proportion of the rental market.There is concern that young adults are being priced out of areas where they want to work, and are unable to save enough for a deposit towards their first property.Private renting % by age group, UKRent controls have been suggested as a way of limiting how much people are spending.There is no official measure of what an ""unaffordable"" rent is, but several housing organisations suggest rent should be no more than 30% of income.The private rental sector was regulated for a lot of the 20th Century.In 1915 rent controls were introduced in the UK, capping prices at August 1914 levels. Costs had been driven up by an increased demand for housing.Rules were relaxed before the outbreak of World War Two, but reintroduced in 1939 as housebuilding slowed. They stayed in place until 1968.The regulation of rent for new private tenancies was only abolished in 1989.Berlin recently approved a plan to freeze rents for the next five years, on top of its existing rent controls.The German capital saw protests urging the authorities to keep housing affordable. The average monthly rent for a furnished Berlin flat is about €1,100 (£940).The plan still needs to be approved by the state parliament. It could apply to 1.4 million properties, but not to social housing - which has separate rules - or new-builds.Across Germany, one-fifth of tenants in the private rented sector say they spend more than 40% of their disposable income on rent.In Paris, average rents are assigned to different areas, with landlords unable to charge more than 20% above that price.And in New York City new laws were introduced in June, establishing permanent rent controls. Cities in the rest of the state can also adopt controls.Rent controls introduced in San Francisco may have had an unexpected knock-on effect.A Stanford University study in 2017 found that measures introduced there led some landlords to convert their properties into expensive apartments.That was because these were classed as new-builds, which were exempt from the restrictions.Researchers found that between 1994 and 2010, people in rent-controlled properties paid about $2.9bn (£2.3bn) less in rent.But they also found that renters who came to the city later paid an extra $2.9bn over the same period, largely because of a shortage of housing.The Labour Party says it would introduce rent controls to help tenants in the private sector.It has also pledged to introduce open-ended tenancies to protect them from unfair evictions.In Scotland, more than 12,000 people signed a petition calling on the Scottish government to introduce ""proper rent controls"".In December 2017, changes to Scottish law brought an end to fixed-term tenancies. Rent increases can now only be made once every 12 months.The current Welsh government has not indicated an intention to pursue such a policy.In Northern Ireland, there is rent control on unfit private tenancies that began after 1 April 2007 and some other types of tenancy.But some people have questioned what rent controls could mean for the housing market.A 2015 survey of private landlords by University of Cambridge suggested that a three-year freeze on existing private rents would not make much difference to affordability.More radical measures, like setting rents at two-thirds of the current market value, could lead landlords to sell their properties.Jonathan Cribb, an economist for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, previously suggested rent controls could affect the quality of housing.Landlords could look for other ways to save costs, he said, ""and a key way to do that is to not maintain the property""."
business	Neil Woodford's flagship equity income fund to stay locked	Celebrated'We don't expect to see our money soon'What happened to the Woodford fund?	"Well-known stockpicker Neil Woodford's flagship fund will remain locked for investors, it has been confirmed.The extension, announced as the initial 28-day suspension expired, means investors will have to wait at least another month to withdraw their money.Investors in the Equity Income Fund have now not been able to access their money since 3 June.Withdrawals were frozen after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back.""It remains in the best interests of all investors in the fund to continue the suspension,"" Link, the regulated manager of the fund, said in a letter to investors posted on its website.The next update on the fund will be before 29 July, the next formal deadline for a review.Mr Woodford fuelled speculation that the fund could be locked for a long period, by reiterating that there is no ""prescribed limit"" to the suspension in a video statement to investors.""Of course, we understand that people want access to their money, they are very frustrated by not being able to deal in the fund. But we are using the time . . . to ensure we get the right outcomes for our investors,"" he added.Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell said it was now ""imperative"" that Mr Woodford communicated clearly with investors on progress.""While this is difficult given liquidity is a moving target, investors deserve to be kept fully informed as the portfolio is repositioned.""Mr Hughes said the fund's performance had continued to deteriorate since the suspension, dropping 4% compared to a 3% rise in the FTSE All Share over the same period.Mr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest names in stockpicking - which is when a fund manager analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment.He was widely celebrated for previous success, and backed until the suspension by huge investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - but both now face questions over how business was conducted amid criticism from investors.Investor Claire Jebson and her husband have some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund. It was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education which is due to start in September.However, she does not expect her money to be unlocked for another six to 12 months - missing the planned start of his studies.""We didn't know this block could happen - our mistake. It is good that we all are aware now, but sad that this had to happen for us to find out,"" she said, echoing the views of many investors.""We do have a back-up plan and I am sure others are in a worse position.""Paul Madon, from Leicester, said he expected the value of the investment to drop sharply when the suspension is eventually lifted.""I thought [the Woodford fund] would be boringly safe. It was not,"" the 67-year-old said.""I will get out as soon as I can, and take the loss.""Stuart Evans, who is saving for his grandchildren and spoke of his frustration with Hargreaves Lansdown last month, also said he expected to take a ""big hit"" when the fund eventually reopens.When the fund launched five years ago, Mr Woodford's previous record meant thousands of investors trusted him with their money.At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income Fund managed £10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds.In its first year, there were returns of 18% on investors' money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time.However, far from uniquely, this was followed by struggles in the last couple of years.As a result, the fund has brought very little return for investors who have been in it throughout. Figures from FE Analytics show the fund has made a total return of 0.36% since its launch.It also meant that investors pulled out at an increasingly rapid rate. The fund now manages £3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar.Owing to this ""increased level of redemptions"", Mr Woodford and his backers said investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. In effect, it was suspended while they reordered the fund.There has been criticism that, in the meantime, Mr Woodford has continued to charge management fees to customers.Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee of MPs, said fees should be halted while trading in the fund was suspended."

"Every adult in the UK should receive a weekly basic income of £48, according to the recommendations in a new report.The move could be paid for by scrapping more than 1,000 tax reliefs, a report by Professor Guy Standing, a professor at SOAS University suggests.The Labour Party - which has previously floated the idea of a basic income - said it would study the report ahead of drawing up its next manifesto.A universal basic income is already being trialled in other countries.The report, entitled Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy, was written by Professor Standing, an authority on the concept of the basic income.He was asked to write it by the Progressive Economy Forum, a left-leaning group of economists.Advocates of a basic income say it reduces poverty and inequality by providing a guaranteed income.But Conservative deputy chairman Helen Whately said it would be ""a kick in the teeth to hardworking taxpayers"".""It would mean benefit payments for everyone, from Premier League footballers to investment bankers and even prisoners, costing billions, while hammering ordinary workers in the pocket by scrapping the tax-free income allowance.""The Treasury also criticised the report, saying it was ""committed to supporting working people keep more of what they earn, while providing a strong and sustainable safety net for those who need it"".""Our policies are highly redistributive - this year the lowest income households will receive over £4 in public spending for every £1 they pay in tax, while the highest income households will contribute over £5 in tax for every £1 they receive in public spending,"" it added.Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means.The author of this latest report, Professor Guy Standing, told the BBC: ""A basic income would be paid in cash, a moderate amount, a basic amount unconditionally to each individual man and woman equally, a smaller amount for a child and the good thing is it would be unconditional and it wouldn't be means tested and it would be a right, an economic right.""Professor Standing said the amount would change over time as the funding for a basic income is built up.However, initially he said the weekly sum would be £48, which he said would be a ""significant amount for many people"".""Now £48 is not a lot for most people but for a lot of people out there they have £20 left at the end of the week after they've paid their rent and their food, so this is a significant amount for many people.""A lower sum would be paid to children, under these proposals.A rough calculation shows that if about 60 million people were paid £48 a week, that would come to about £150bn a year.Professor Standing said there are 1,156 tax reliefs in the UK at the moment and if they were scrapped that would pay for a basic income.""What that means [is] it's income foregone by the Treasury. Most of these tax reliefs didn't have any economic rationale and they're giveaways that are increasing inequality.""If we phased out those tax reliefs the total revenue foregone by the Treasury from tax reliefs is £420bn per year and that's their own estimates, not mine,"" he added.Some countries have tested paying a basic income to citizens.In western Kenya, the government is paying every adult in one village $22 a month for 12 years to see if a regular payment can help lift them out of poverty.The Netherlands and Italy have also launched trials, while Scotland is considering piloting basic income schemes in four cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell recently said that Labour would include a plan for universal basic income in its next general election manifesto.However, a two-year trial in Finland, where a sample of 2,000 unemployed adults were given €560 a month, was not extended.And in Canada, Ontario's newly elected centre-right government said it was scrapping a three-year basic income pilot project that hoped to discover whether it was better than existing welfare schemes.No, there have been a couple of similar studies this year alone.In March the New Economics Foundation think tank published a report in which it proposed replacing the personal tax allowance with a Weekly National Allowance of £48. However, it did not call it a basic income.A week later the leftwing think tank Compass, suggested a universal basic income of £60 for each adult, £175 for those over 65 and £40 for children under the age of 18.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who is attending the launch of the independent study on Tuesday, welcomed the report.He said: ""This report is an important contribution to the debate around inequality, austerity, poverty and how we establish a fair and just economic system.""There have been pilots of 'basic income' elsewhere and Guy Standing has looked at them and come forward with proposals.""Whatever mechanism we use, whether 'basic income' or another, we have to lead in developing a radical mechanism aimed at eradicating poverty, but also means testing.""We will be studying the contents and recommendations of this report carefully as we put together our reform policies for the next Labour government.""Opponents of a basic income are worried about how it would be paid for and what cuts would have to be made elsewhere.And the government has previously said a universal basic income would not work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities."
business	Government borrowing in October highest since 2014	'Sobering''Mixed news'	"Government borrowing in October rose to its highest level in five years, official data shows.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing last month hit £11.2bn, £2.3bn more than last year.That is much higher than economists had expected and it is likely to rise again after the election, with all major parties making costly spending pledges.Total borrowing this financial year, which runs from April, is £46.3bn, over 10% higher than the same time in 2018.In October, central government borrowed £7.6bn and local governments added another £1bn to the total.The Bank of England, meanwhile, borrowed £2.5bn and another £100m was borrowed to cover pension costs.Debt climbed by £32.1bn to £1,798.5bn, or 80.4% of gross domestic product.Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party have promised big increases in spending on health, schools, police and infrastructure ahead of a general election on December 12.In September, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years and Labour has said it wants to nationalise energy companies and other utilities.Both parties have also promised to put more money into infrastructure if they win the election next month.As the major parties lay out their spending and tax ambitions, there is a new blow for the next chancellor, with a reminder that the cupboard is pretty bare.Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the last month was the worst for government borrowing in five years, with a deficit of £11.2bn - up by more than £2bn on a year ago.That increase was down to an increase in goods and staff spending - perhaps due to Brexit preparations. This leaves the whole year deficit on track to rise for the first time in a decade.Crucially, the rise in borrowing in recent months risks wiping out the surplus on the current (day-to-day) account which was £5bn last year.So any party which targets balancing the books on that score will have to raise taxes/cut spending to offset any giveaways.Think tank The Resolution Foundation has said those promises would see public spending grow to its highest level since the 1970s, under either Labour or the Conservatives.James Smith, research director for the body, said: ""The 2019 public finances deterioration provides a sobering backdrop to manifesto launches this week, alongside a wider weaker outlook for both domestic and global growth next year.""With all main parties committed to balancing the books on current spending, this deterioration should be a reminder to whoever wins the election that the state of the public finances will continue to be a constraint on plans for higher public service spending or tax cuts in the next parliament.""Labour has said it would fund some of the increased spending through higher income tax on the top 5% of earners - who already pay half of all income tax - as well as reversing cuts in corporation tax made since 2010.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, has said he will not go ahead with a planned further cut in corporation tax, but he does intend to reduce workers' social security contributions.Corporation tax revenues fell 6.2% in October, the biggest fall for that month in four years.But overall tax revenues have increased by 2.4% so far this year - driven by a big rise in staff costs and higher spending on other goods and services.""Today's data contained mixed news on the public finances,"" said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC.""On the one hand,"" he said, ""borrowing in October was £2.3bn more than in the same month last year.""On the other hand, estimates of borrowing in the six months from April to September have been revised down by £5.2bn, reflecting lower estimated government spending.""He added: ""The net effect of these changes is favourable, with public borrowing in the financial year to date up only £4.3bn compared to the same period last year, rather than an estimated overshoot of just over £7bn in last month's original data."""
business	Why US tech giants are putting billions into housing	'Unsustainable' courseSoaring prices'A drop in the bucket''Chipping around the edges'	"History teacher Leon Sultan was raised in a San Francisco that working class families could call home. That place has, for the most part, vanished.The city is now the centre of America's thriving tech industry, with some of the highest housing costs in the US. Homeownership is in retreat and homelessness is surging, alongside newly-minted fortunes.Mr Sultan currently lives in a rent-stabilised one bedroom apartment with his wife, who also works in education, and his four-year-old son. When they move to a bigger place in a few weeks, their rent will almost double.""When I was born in the city in 1978, a two-income earning family could buy a home,"" he says. ""At this point, the only way to buy a home, if you're a normal person... is to have some sort of edge.""""I feel lucky that I haven't been displaced yet.""Mr Sultan, and many others, blame the changes on the Bay Area's tech boom, which has created vast wealth divides.The growing backlash has played out in fights over new taxes targeting tech and protests against the commuter buses that ferry workers south from San Francisco to Silicon Valley, where many tech giants have their headquarters.For years, the tech giants have faced down their critics unabashed. But now there are signs of change.In June, Google said it would invest $1bn in housing and Facebook has also pledged $1bn. Apple upped the ante this month, saying it would devote $2.5bn to the issue.""We know the course we are on is unsustainable,"" Apple boss Tim Cook said as he revealed his firm's plans.Those moves followed a flurry of smaller donations and activity from firms such as Cisco and Microsoft, which said it would invest $500m in housing in its home state of Washington.The commitments represent a ""kind of acknowledgement from the tech industry that yes, they're playing a role in this housing affordability crisis,"" says Jeffrey Buchanan from Silicon Valley Rising, which has pressed the tech giants on the issue for years.""I'm hopeful that it is a change in mindset in the industry... the old way doesn't work.""As the tech industry has boomed, home prices and asking rents in the Bay Area have roughly doubled over the past decade, becoming by many counts the highest in the US.Last month, the San Francisco Association of Realtors said the median home price in San Francisco had hit $1.4m. The average asking rent exceeded $3,200 per month, according to research firm Moody's Analytics-Reis.Wages in the area have increased as well, but not as fast as housing costs.A family needs to earn $126,800 a year to rent a typical two-bedroom property in San Francisco without spending more than 30% of their income - the share typically considered affordable. In 2017, about 40% of Bay Area renters spent more.For Mr Sultan, homeownership is out of the question, but he says his family is lucky. There's a woman on his street living in her car.""I'm not feeling sorry for myself,"" he says. ""There are a lot of folks in this city who are struggling way harder than we are.""The high costs are forcing companies to pay more and work harder to find staff, one reason the tech firms have taken an interest.For the most part, their pledges aren't philanthropy.Apple is lending the state up to $1bn to help finance affordable housing projects and providing $1bn to California's first-time homebuyer fund.Google and Facebook also plan to invest hundreds of millions in new housing. Land owned by the tech companies that will be made available for housing construction accounts for another major part of the commitments - a full $750m worth in Google's case.Such large promises are ""unprecedented"", but a lack of detail makes them hard to evaluate, says Carol Galante, director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.""It's in their self-interest but it's also obviously in the community's interest.""Facebook and Google have each said their plans should produce about 20,000 new housing units, some of which will be offered at below market rates. Apple has not provided an estimate for its total commitment, but expects to build about 3,600 new affordable units on its land.But California State Senator Scott Wiener, whose district includes San Francisco, says the plans represent ""a drop in the bucket"" compared to the money and policy changes needed.""I'm glad that Apple, Facebook, Google are doing this, but I think we also have to be crystal clear that this is not going to solve the problem.""Between 2012 and 2017, San Francisco added fewer than 21,000 new housing units, while the population grew by more than 58,000 and the number of jobs jumped by 130,000.Senator Wiener blames policies that hamper development - like rules that limit the height of buildings - for much of the growing gap between supply and demand.""The problem is not that we have job growth,"" he says. ""The problem is we didn't plan for it.""But Peter Cohen, from the Council of Community Housing Organisations, says it's ""simplistic"" to rely on increased supply to solve the crisis.New construction is often designed for the tech industry's upper crust, even though many of the new jobs are lower-wage ones such as cooks and drivers, he says.He says the tech industry's announcements seem in part like a ""branding"" effort to pre-empt new policies, such as higher taxes.""We've got to have stable and significant sources of funding,"" he says. ""Otherwise we're just chipping around the edges.""Mr Sultan, the teacher, says he welcomes the plans for more housing - especially if it's close to company campuses. Expansion in other regions such as Texas - where Apple has announced a new base - make him even more excited.""The big issue for me is, why does the tech industry have to be housed in San Francisco,"" he says. ""Why can't they disperse throughout the country?""But the broad trends seen in his home city - rising housing costs, slow construction, and declining homeownership, especially among younger families - are happening across the US, especially in areas where tech companies are expanding.And as people and companies leave the Bay Area, they add to housing strains in suburbs and other cities, pushing the poorest further away from the jobs they need.""We've got this kind of rolling musical chairs that's going on,"" Ms Galante says. And those with the least, she warns, are ""losing""."
business	Budget 2018: 'Squeeze continues' for lower-income families	Who benefits?	"The era of austerity is not over for working families on benefits or government departments like transport, according to one of the first independent analyses of the Budget.The Resolution Foundation said Philip Hammond had delivered £55bn in tax cuts and increases in public spending.It said that richer households would feel the most positive effects.However, the report highlighted that many of the cuts to welfare announced in 2015 are still to be rolled out.That includes the £1.5bn benefits freeze for people in work which the foundation said would see a low income couple with children up to £200 a year worse off.The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, said it was the top 10% of households that would gain most - around £410 a year - from the decision to increase the amount people can earn before they start paying income tax and the higher rate of tax.Poorer households would gain around £30 a year.Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the chancellor pointed out that he had allocated an extra £6.5bn for Universal Credit and raised the Living Wage.""If you look at all the measures in the Budget - and we've done this very carefully - you will see that it is those on the lowest incomes that proportionately benefit the most,"" he said.The Resolution Foundation said that with borrowing far lower than expected and economic growth predicted to be slightly higher over the next two years, Mr Hammond decided to spend three quarters of the £74bn extra headroom that was provided by the better public finances.""The chancellor was able to navigate the near impossible task in his Budget of easing austerity, seeing debt fall and avoiding big tax rises, thanks to a £74bn fiscal windfall,"" said Torsten Bell, the director of the foundation.""He chose to spend the vast majority of this on the NHS, income tax cuts and a welcome boost to Universal Credit.""But while yesterday's Budget represented a seismic shift in the government's approach to the public finances, it spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity - particularly for low and middle income families.""Mr Bell said the chancellor had made ""very welcome"" commitments to helping people on the new Universal Credit benefit but that three-quarters of the benefit cuts announced in 2015 were still to take effect.""Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top 10% of households,"" Mr Bell said.""On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in.""This Budget has certainly seen a turnaround in the government's approach to the public finances - with day-to-day spending per person set to rise by 4% a year until 2023 - in contrast with a 4% fall previously planned.In his Budget yesterday, Mr Hammond said that the ""hard work"" of the British people was paying off ""and the era of austerity was finally coming to an end""."
business	Party plans would ‘boost minimum pay for millions’		"Plans from the two biggest political parties to raise the minimum wage would boost pay for millions of people, a leading economic research group says.The move would also double or treble the number of people whose wages are set by government, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said.Some have argued that current minimum wage levels are too low, leaving people in work struggling.But the report's author warned rises should be ""careful and incremental"".At present, the government's National Living Wage pays £8.21 an hour for workers aged 25 and over.For younger workers, the National Minimum Wage is currently set at £7.70 an hour for 21-24 years olds and £6.15 for those aged 18-20.Workers aged 16 to 17 can only expect a minimum hourly wage of £4.35, or £3.90 if they are part of an apprenticeship scheme.The Conservatives plan to lower the age limit for the National Living Wage to 21 and pay around £10.39 per hour by 2024 (or £9.59 in 2020 prices).That would increase the numbers on this higher rate to 4.4 million - up from 1.9 million today.Labour pledges to introduce a £10 minimum wage in 2020 for all employees aged 16 and over. This would benefit an additional 4.6 million employees, taking the total on this rate to 6.5 million.Under both parties' plans, private sector employees and the youngest workers - who get the lowest salaries - would see the biggest impact, the research found.The IFS said Labour's proposals suggested 49% of workers aged 21-24, 82% of those aged 18-20, and 94% of those aged 16-17 would be covered by the minimum wage.Conservative plans suggest the share of 21 to 24-year-old employees affected by the minimum wage would rise from 9% today to 36% by 2024.The IFS warned that sharply higher wages for young workers may see them struggle to find work, although it conceded that the point at which a minimum wage would affect employment is not known, and that timing was more of a problem than the wage level itself.""Recent minimum wage rises have boosted earnings and there is little evidence that they have damaged employment, so there may well be scope for further increases,"" said the report's author, Xiaowei Xu.""But both the Conservatives' and Labour's plans would take us into uncharted waters.""That calls for a careful and incremental process to ensure that, if the employment prospects of the low-paid do start to be impacted, policymakers can change course before it is too late.It said Labour's policy would mean nearly 30% of private sector workers' wages would be set by the state, while the Conservative plans would set 20% of private sector wages.The research pointed out that of all households in ""in-work poverty"", only a fifth have someone on the minimum wage, suggesting the number of hours worked is also a factor in raising living standards.Someone is in in-work poverty when their income falls below the poverty line due to their low income.The North of England and Wales are the regions most affected, with up to 30% of workers aged 21 or more having their wages covered by the minimum.Of the industries, hospitality, catering, retail, and agricultural work could all see the most change, with up to 40% of workers aged 21 or more captured by the minimum wage bracket.For finance, communication, public administration and defence, the figure will stay less than 10%.Women will be more affected by the plans than men in each party's plan, said the IFS, with more than 30% captured by the wage minimum under Labour's plan, and more than 20% under the Conservative proposal.The National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage are distinct from the real living wage, which was devised by the Living Wage Foundation charity.It argues that the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt its more generous, independently calculated rate.Businesses who have signed up to the voluntary scheme pay an hourly rate of £9.30, or £10.75 in London."
business	Ryanair warns on profits as strikes hit income	Bigger fuel billDisputes'Long-term damage'	"Ryanair has warned investors its full-year profits will be lower than expected, partly due to the recent wave of industrial action.The airline said its profits would be 12% lower than the €1.25-1.35bn (£1.11-1.2bn) previously forecast, and it now expects profits of between €1.1-1.2bn.Ryanair said this was due to higher oil prices, higher costs associated with EU flight compensation rules, and weaker fares due to the recent strikes.It warned it may lower forecasts again.Shares in the airline opened down 8%.Last week, cabin crew and pilots in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal took industrial action which led to a number of flight cancellations.Ryanair said fares for the third quarter of the year were lower as forward bookings, particularly for the October school mid-terms and Christmas, were being affected by fear of further strikes.The carrier said it had not hedged its fuel bill against prices rises, and this meant it would be paying 10% more for its fuel thanks to the recent rise in the global price.Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""While we successfully managed five strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent co-ordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight cancellations).""Customer confidence, forward bookings and [third quarter] fares have been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and Christmas, in those five countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated.""The airline is making cuts to some routes and closing some of its bases.Its four-aircraft Eindhoven base in the Netherlands will close, although most routes to and from Eindhoven will continue on overseas-based aircraft. It is taking the same action at its two-aircraft Bremen base in Germany and is making cuts at its Niederrhein base.Ryanair says all affected customers have been contacted by email or text message, and will be re-accommodated on other flights or refunded as they wish.After many years of ignoring workers' attempts to get it to recognise unions, Ryanair finally agreed at the end of 2017.But staff in a range of countries have continued to have issues with the company's employment practices, in particular its use of contracts based on Irish employment law and its insistence on paying staff through Irish bank accounts, which cause those based elsewhere extra inconvenience and costs.In a complex industrial relations background, involving different disputes in different countries with cabin crew and pilots with their own grievances, Ryanair broadly says it is offering staff what they have asked for.But staff in certain parts of the company's cross-border operations plainly do not agree, because the possibility of further strike action remains.Ryanair said in its statement it ""cannot rule out further disruptions in [the third quarter], which may require full-year guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of loss-making winter capacity"".David Madden, an analysts at CMC Markets, said it was plain Ryanair's aggressive stance was having a negative impact on its business: ""In August 2017 the airline's share price hit an all-time high as the company made a concerted effort to improve customer service prior to that, and it clearly paid off.""He pointed out that since then, the shares had lost 38%""Clients like cheap airfares, but they value flight certainty more, and the company is running the risk of doing long-term damage to the brand. The airline is still aiming to make over €1bn profit, so it's not like they can't afford to pay their staff well."""
business	Could a basic income replace Universal Credit?	'No magic bullet'	"A survey has found support for local experiments to explore paying people a basic income as an alternative to Universal Credit.The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) found 40% of people questioned backed local tests to see how such payments would work.Only 15% would oppose the idea, a Populus survey of 2,070 people found.However, the Department for Work and Pensions questioned the idea.It said a basic income ""would not work for those who need more support"".The RSA describes a basic income as ""a regular, unconditional payment made to every adult and child. It is not dependent on other earned or unearned income, is not means-tested and is not withdrawn as earnings rise"".Some countries have tested paying a basic income to citizens.In western Kenya, the government is paying every adult in one village $22 a month for 12 years to see if a regular payment can help lift them out of poverty.The Netherlands and Italy have also launched trials, while Scotland is considering piloting basic income schemes in four cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell recently said that Labour would include a plan for universal basic income in its next general election manifesto.However, a two-year trial in Finland, where a sample of 2,000 unemployed adults were given €560 a month, will not be extended.And in Canada, Ontario's newly elected centre-right government said it was scrapping a three-year basic income pilot project that hoped to discover whether it was better than existing welfare schemes.The RSA survey found the cost of funding basic income was a concern for the public, with 45% of those questioned fearing it was ""unaffordable"".Anthony Painter, director of the RSA's action and research centre, said: ""Basic income is no magic bullet, but with HM Opposition exploring the idea and the Scottish government looking to pilot it with four Scottish councils, basic income is increasingly seen as one plausible response to modern economic insecurity.""A DWP spokesman said: ""A universal basic income would not work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities.""It's reasonable for people to meet certain requirements to receive their Universal Credit payment and these are agreed with people in advance - sanctions are only used in the minority of cases when someone doesn't meet these requirements without a good reason."""
business	Are US billionaires really going to pay more tax?	Growing gapTax backlashWall Street worriesDemocrats divided	"Higher taxes are a hot topic in American political circles.Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a 2% tax on family fortunes above $50m.Rival candidate Bernie Sanders, who tugged the Democratic Party to the left in his 2016 presidential run, is back with his own tax on ""extreme wealth"" and remains another top contender.Billionaires such as George Soros, Warren Buffett, Eli Broad and Marc Benioff have also come out in support of higher taxes on the super rich.Even US President Donald Trump speaks about the need to close tax loopholes for the wealthy.Yet for years, standard political doctrine has held that anti-tax sentiment is as American as apple pie.So what's going on?Americans have long told opinion polls they think the wealthy should pay more.But the issue has gained political traction in recent years, galvanised by eye-catching research about rising income inequality, stalling upward mobility and findings that the richest 400 Americans now pay lower tax rates than any other income group.Economists are engaged in a heated debate about just how big the gulf between rich and poor is.But there is little doubt that the gap has widened sharply over four decades toward record levels, fuelled by a mix of forces, including rapid gains in company shares and a relatively stagnant minimum wage.The US central bank estimates that the top 1% of US households hold about 39% of the country's wealth, a term that includes assets such as property.The top 1% also account for about 13% of income, after taxes and other federal transfers, according to a 2016 Congressional Budget Office analysis.That's a higher share than in the UK, where the top 1% is estimated to account for about 8% of income and around 24% of overall wealth.Exposés of how some wealthy individuals have avoided paying their taxes in full, and scandals such as celebrities bribing college admissions officers for their children, have added to the anger.Almost two-thirds of Americans told Pew Research Center this year that they were bothered ""a lot"" by the feeling that some corporations and the wealthy don't pay their fair share of taxes.Even a poll from Fox News - a television network known for its conservative bent - found that 70% of voters favoured tax increases on families making more than $10m a year.The discontent is especially deep among Democrats, who were outraged when Republicans cut rates for the wealthy and corporations as part of a $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017.Just 32% of Democrats now say the present federal tax system is fair, compared with 64% of Republicans, Pew found.""There's genuine frustration around the country and the political discussion is, I think, reflecting that,"" says Arloc Sherman, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank.""And it's about time,"" he adds.As fury over the economic divide grows louder, the American business class, traditionally a staunch defender of low-tax regimes, has started to shift its tone.This summer, to great fanfare, a key business group declared that companies' interests extended beyond shareholders to include employees and local communities.Other Wall Street titans have argued that reform of capitalism is necessary to head-off more draconian changes.But their worries don't necessarily signal that higher taxes are likely anytime soon, according to Andrea Louise Campbell, a political science professor at MIT, who is working on a book about American attitudes toward taxation.She says that although Americans have said they favour higher taxes on the wealthy for years, when it comes to the ballot box their support depends on what kind of tax is being proposed. Voters typically back high rates on annual income but not, for example, on inheritances.Reducing inequality also routinely ranks low on the list of voter priorities - with fewer than 3% identifying it as the top problem in Gallup surveys.""It is certainly the case that income inequality has increased and many Americans are aware of that and are unhappy with the trend, but translating that into a desire for redistributive taxing and spending policies is more difficult,"" Ms Campbell says.A few newspaper columns and famous names notwithstanding, surveys show the rich tend to be anti-tax - and the rich still have the most influence.Despite the populist tone US President Donald Trump struck during his 2016 presidential campaign, once in office he championed a tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.There is even a divide among Democrats, as many moderates stop short of supporting a wealth tax - which covers items such as property, yachts and art in addition to income - that is backed by Ms Warren and Mr Sanders.They have argued that such plans are not only unrealistic but bad policy, since they can be difficult to enforce.Wealth taxes have been phased out in much of Europe, and they would almost certainly face a legal challenge in the US over whether they meet the constitution's criteria for what the federal government is allowed to tax.Even if the public was convinced by Ms Warren's proposal - which would place a 2% tax on household assets over $50m and 3% over $1bn - it's unlikely to make it past Republicans and lobbyists in Washington, Ms Campbell adds.""The role of public opinion in setting taxes is relatively modest,"" says Ms Campbell. ""Even if ordinary Americans on average would like increased taxes on high income, high wealth people, I don't think they're the ones with influence on policymakers."""
business	Pay rise plans: Is the minimum wage enough to live on?		"Money is everywhere in the amusement arcades on Southend's seafront: being fed into slot machines, paid out in jackpots, or hanging over the edge of penny fall games.When running a business like this, the money that really matters is staff wages. Pay is the dominant cost and, with a host of employees on the minimum wage, it is a bill that has been rising.""There has been quite a dramatic increase [in the minimum wage] in recent years. At peak times, we can absorb the costs but it stretches us even thinner for the rest of the time,"" says John Remblance, manager at Star Amusements.""The hard season is getting even harder.""The arcades run by this family firm are open every day except Christmas Day. Further rises in the minimum or National Living Wage promised by all the major political parties could make this a more expensive and therefore more seasonal business, he says.When the tourists and day-trippers leave, they may need to close their doors.While those on the lowest pay have seen increases, managers' wages have stayed the same. There is a danger, Mr Remblance says, that a narrowing gap dims ambition. There may not be the incentive in the pay packet to take on extra responsibility and extra work.At 25, workers of his age see the minimum wage of £7.70 an hour become the National Living Wage of £8.21 an hour. The extra cost has meant a change of policy by the business. When once they would have only employed slightly older workers, with the experience to cope with the anti-social behaviour they encounter, now they take on younger staff too.One of those is Amber Scraggs, a 21-year-old working in the cashier booth giving change to customers. She works for 46 hours a week on the minimum wage.It can be a tough job, she says. Not everyone is as friendly as the stray cat that wanders in most evenings, circling the arcade games and roulette machines. The financial rewards also leave her with worries.""The minimum wage isn't enough to be able to live by myself,"" she says. She shares the domestic bills with her partner.""And it is too expensive to live in Southend in the long term. [Housing] developments are for people living here but working in London.""One in five of the town's working population commute into London, so the average salary among Southend residents is £144 higher than it is for those who actually work in the town, according to the Centre for Cities think tank. That is quite a difference for people such as Miss Scraggs.The think tank, which focuses on the economic performance of UK cities, said that last year, at £413 per week, average pay in Southend was just over half that in London and the lowest of the UK towns and cities it analysed.Further down the strip, Rebecca Constantinou has been employing young staff at her family-run cafe for the past 23 years. She pays just above the minimum wage, but a higher rate is likely to mean a bigger wage bill.She is never short of applicants, she says, but with higher pay will come greater responsibility.""If there is a massive jump [in pay] we are all going to have to be more professional, there will be more competition for jobs, so they will need to work a bit harder,"" she says.That is reflected in a report by the Low Pay Commission, which advises governments on minimum wage rates. It says that rising statutory minimum pay must be supported by economic conditions.Raising the minimum wage too fast in tough economic times could lead to problems, it argues. Greater productivity from workers is needed to support rising pay.The commission also points out that simply increasing the amount paid per hour to workers does not automatically end low pay. Why? Because they might not work enough hours in the week.To illustrate its point, it says there are 4.7 million workers aged 21 and over in the UK who are deemed to be low-paid based on their hourly rate, just under 18% of the workforce. However, when looking at total weekly income instead, this figure rises to 7.2 million individuals, or over 27% of the workforce.A greater proportion of part-time workers than those working full-time are on the National Living Wage (the minimum wage for those aged 25 and over). More women than men are on the statutory minimum. All of this means more attention needs to be paid to the relationship between pay and in-work benefits.All the major political parties have pledged further rises in minimum wage levels.For example, Labour has said it wants a £10 hourly rate for workers aged 16 and over to be the statutory minimum. The Conservatives say the National Living Wage should increase to two-thirds of median income - the equivalent of nearly £10.50 an hour - within five years, and be paid to those aged 21 and over.The SNP has called for the end of the age restrictions for the National Living Wage.An increasing number of businesses are paying the so-called ""real living wage"", which is a higher, voluntary threshold and is separate from the statutory minimum.An independent report, commissioned by then-chancellor Philip Hammond earlier this year but recently published, says there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels.Prof Arindrajit Dube, an academic in the US and an expert on the subject, said there was ""room for exploring a more ambitious National Living Wage"" in the UK in the coming years.Plans would make it one of the most generous in the world, but Prof Dube stressed that - owing to relatively little evidence being available - the Low Pay Commission should be able to review the effect on jobs as pay increased.Back in Southend, while money topples out of one of the arcade machines, manager Mr Remblance stresses that he wants to keep his amusement arcade open all year round.""It encourages loyalty from staff,"" he says. However, he knows that how much he pays them will not be entirely in his hands, but will depend - in part - on the UK's short-term political future."
business	Airbnb to report homeowners' income to Danish tax authorities	'Progressive attitude'	"Airbnb will automatically report homeowners' income to tax authorities in Denmark under a landmark move.It will make it easier to spot tax evasion by homeowners renting out rooms and properties via the site.Danish tax minister Karsten Lauritzen said the country wants a ""sharing economy"" to flourish, but on condition taxes are paid.The move - which needs clearance in parliament - comes as several countries try to rein in Airbnb tax evaders.In addition to the issue of taxes, Airbnb is blamed for pushing up house prices in major cities and taking away business from hotels and B&B outlets.The Denmark deal will also include limiting the number of days an owner may list a property to 70 a year. Owners will be given a tax-free allowance of up to 40,000 kroner (£4,690) a year.""We want a flourishing sharing economy in Denmark where it is possible for renters to earn a reasonable tax-free amount on making their property available,"" said Mr Lauritzen. ""But it is under the condition that tax payments are in order.""Airbnb had about 30,000 renters in Denmark in 2017 and more than 900,000 visiting users. A typical Airbnb host in Denmark earned on average 15,500 kroner by sharing their space for 23 nights a year.Patrick Robinson, Airbnb head of public policy in Europe, said the move was ""innovative and forward-thinking"" by Denmark.""The progressive attitude of Denmark is an example to the world and demonstrates how positive results can be achieved when policymakers and Airbnb work together on the shared goals of making cities better places to live, work and visit,"" he said in a statement.This week, German tax officials asked Airbnb to surrender all data on its country's users to help track down tax evaders. And in China the company has agreed to give to authorities the booking and passport details of people staying in Airbnb properties."
business	Neil Woodford closes crisis-hit investment empire	'Deep regrets'Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance correspondent:	"The UK's best-known stockpicker is to quit his remaining investment funds, signalling the end of his multi-billion-pound empire.Neil Woodford was sacked from his flagship fund early on Tuesday, and has now announced he will quit the last two funds.He described it as a ""highly painful decision"", adding his business would be wound down in ""an orderly fashion"".Mr Woodford earned a huge reputation over 30 years of successful investing.At its peak his business managed more than £14bn.The so-called ""Oracle of Oxford"" was dismissed from his troubled £3.1bn Equity Income fund by its administrators on Tuesday. The fund will be wound up and any cash returned to investors. It follows a series of disastrous investments.That sacking initially prompted an angry response, with Mr Woodford saying it was a decision ""I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests"" of the business.But on Tuesday evening, in a further announcement, he said he would abandon the last two funds, Income Focus and Woodford Patient Capital and close his investment management business.On Wednesday, shares in the Woodford Income Focus Fund were suspended from dealing amid a rush to pull out investor money, with administrators now considering all options.Mr Woodford said: ""We have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. We will fulfil our fund management responsibilities to WPCT and the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund and once completed will close the company in an orderly fashion.""I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.""Mr Woodford built his reputation during 26 years at the City firm Invesco. An investment of £1,000 in his first funds would have returned £25,000 by the time he left.He set up his own business, and his stellar success meant savers poured millions into his new funds. But several big investments in stock market listed companies performed poorly, and investors began withdrawing money.To compound the problems, Mr Woodford had built up stakes in a number of unlisted technology and healthcare companies he believed had strong growth potential.When the redemption requests gathered pace, he found it difficult to raise money quickly by selling stakes in these private companies.The Equity Income Fund was suspended in June after being crippled by redemption demands. It meant that investors' money would be locked in for months.Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment firm AJ Bell, said there was ""a feeling of inevitability"" about the closure. Without any money coming in ""it was difficult to see how the business could survive"", he said.The unwinding of any funds will be a long process. Darius McDermott, managing director of financial adviser Chelsea Financial Services, said the situation was ""a mess"" and the flagship fund's closure would make it ""a forced seller of all stocks"".Neil Woodford had been the darling of the armchair investor - but, as one said today, the whole thing had become ""toxic"".Four years ago, he was giving them 20% returns. Now he is giving them losses, a lot of uncertainty, and perhaps a lesson in hubris.Some of those investors will be kicking themselves for being too reliant on a ""star"" manager, rather than spreading their investments, as has always been the advice.The fund manager may soon have found he had nothing left to manage, so commentators say it was inevitable that he has thrown in the towel.Those stockpickers who remain in the ring may find individual investors are a lot more cautious about giving them their support, and their money."

business	McDonald's UK staff join global day of protests over pay	'Poverty pay''Fighting back'	"McDonald's workers in the UK have gone on strike as part of a global day of protests over pay.Staff at six London stores walked out, while protests were held across the UK. There was also action in the US, France, Germany, Brazil and Chile.McDonald's said that the strikers represented a ""tiny proportion"" of its UK workforce.The fast food giant was also hit with a legal action in the US over sexual harassment claims.The lawsuit alleges rampant harassment at a Michigan McDonald's franchise, which went ignored by management and was ""emblematic"" of a broader problem at the company.The filing adds to roughly 50 complaints filed against the company in recent years over sexual harassment, according to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which is working on the suit.McDonald's has said it has revamped its harassment training and policies in recent years and is working with its franchises to implement the updates. However, lawyers working on the suit say their clients have seen little change.""They are the definition of window dressing,"" said Gillian Thomas, of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is working on the issue.Workers in the protests are demanding an end to ""poverty pay"" rates and better terms and conditions.In the UK, McDonald's workers are calling for a rise in pay to £15 an hour - over a third more than what they currently earn.They also want an end to youth rates, the choice of guaranteed hours of up to 40 hours a week, notice of shifts four weeks in advance and recognition of their union, the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union (BFAWU).An employee at Crayford McDonald's in London, Lewis Baker, said he will be striking because he struggles to pay rent on his income of £8.80 an hour.Mr Baker, 29, said: ""There are a lot of workers who are struggling to pay their bills and get by day to day.""We don't have set hours, so we don't always earn enough to pay the bills.""If we got £15 an hour, it would have a massive impact - I would be able to afford to pay my rent, to pay my bills, go on holiday and have some kind of work-life balance.""Melissa Evans, 32, a mum who works at McDonald's in Wandsworth Town, London, said McDonald's workers deserved ""the same level of respect as everyone else"".""We are coming together to tackle poverty pay, insecurity of hours and lack of respect, which has gone on at McDonald's for too long.""This is the fourth time McDonald's workers in the UK have gone on strike since September 2017, with each successive strike getting bigger.There has also been strike action around the world over the fast-food giant's pay rates, with thousands walking out in the US.The company has faced criticism for paying executives large salaries, while employees on the shopfloor struggle to get by.There were protests in five German cities on Tuesday, including Berlin and Hamburg, and also in Belgium. There were protests in Israel last week, and action is expected in New Zealand next week.Former boss Steve Easterbrook - who was fired last week for having a relationship with an unnamed employee - received remuneration of $15.9m in 2018. That was 2,124 times the median McDonald's employee salary of $7,473.The UK's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who joined workers outside Downing Street, the prime minister's residence in central London, said low pay and insecure work were ""endemic"" in the fast-food industry.Owen Espley of charity War on Want, which is backing the strikes, said McDonald's workers were exploited but were ""fighting back. [They are] demanding respect and a fair share of the profits"".Speaking about the action in London, a McDonald's spokesman said: ""We are extremely disappointed that a very small number of our people in just a handful of our restaurants are considering industrial action.""We understand only nine people are involved across six restaurants, which is a tiny proportion of our 130,000 workforce and 1,300 restaurants."""
business	Care sector 'leaks' £1.5bn every year	'You expect longevity'	"Hundreds of millions of pounds of care home fees paid by residents and local authorities are never reaching frontline services, claims a report.The Centre for Health and Public Interest has revealed £1.5bn a year ""leaks out"" through rental payments, interest on loans, and profits.The figure is 10% of the total annual income of the UK care home industry.The think tank says some of this money could be used for frontline care if the industry were restructured.The centre's study - which is part funded by Unison - analysed the accounts of 830 adult care home companies across the UK.The average cost for a residential care home place in the UK is £32,084 per year, not including nursing care.The study found that among the 26 largest care home providers, £261m of the money they receive to provide care goes towards repaying debt.Of this, £117m goes to related companies.""Hundreds of millions of pounds a year leak out of the care home industry in the form of rental payments to offshore landlords, in the form of profit, in the form of management fees and in the form of rental payments again to offshore companies,"" CHPI director David Rowlands told Newsnight.""Lots of debt has been loaded onto large care home companies by the companies that brought them and that means in some cases that 16% of all the money that is given over to care for a resident each week disappears out of the system to pay off those high cost loans.""More than 90% of all care home services are now provided by the private sector.Nick Hood, a senior analyst at Opus restructuring, said: ""The average interest rate paid by the major care home operators in 2017 was 11.8%, which means that they were paying over £235m a year in interest and that's money that could be going to frontline care, but isn't.""He said some estimates suggest this financing model pushes up the cost for a care home resident ""by anything between £100 and £200 a week"".According to the Health Foundation think tank, £4.4bn per year will be needed by 2023 just to stabilise the market.One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care, went into administration earlier this year after struggling to repay debts.One of their homes - Ross Wyld in north-east London - closed the year before after they were unable to renegotiate the renewal of their lease.Alan Lazurus's mother, Hettie, was one of the residents forced to relocate.""She was 93, she was obviously getting on but she wasn't actually senile or had dementia at that stage,"" he said.""You put someone into a nursing home - you certainly expect there would be a longevity for her.""Four Seasons declined to comment on the closure of Ross Wyld.The CHPI is calling for A Care Home Transparency Act, so that those paying for care in a care home know exactly where their money goes.You can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

business	'I wish the bank had asked about my spending'	Balance of privacy	"When the proceeds of a house sale meant Amanda Whiteman had £28,000 in her bank account, she knew she should have been saving some of it.Bipolar disorder made that very difficult. The 37-year-old spent the money within nine months.She had a car and a holiday to show for it, but no idea now what she bought with the rest - which was spent during a manic phase of her illness - other than it being ""rubbish"".""I went to the bank to withdraw the money and they gave it to me without any questions,"" said Ms Whiteman, a sales adviser.""Everyone is different. Some would see it as interfering, but any help they could have given me I would have been grateful for afterwards.""Analysis has shown that people with bipolar disorder, depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are particularly prone to overspending and potential problems with money management and debt.Now the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute is calling on banks and building societies to monitor customers' data to spot signs of problems, such as sudden drops in income, dramatic increases in spending, or persistent use of unauthorised overdrafts.It wants banks to use text message alerts, for those who want them, or clear directions of where to go for debt advice.Ms Whiteman said that she would probably have repelled any offers of help at the time she was spending.""I would have thought it was my money, and that the bank was not being helpful or looking after my interests,"" she said.That was why it was crucial, she said, for banks and their customers to be able to put safeguards in place at a time of good health, not during a manic episode.She said she would rather the bank had something on its records to mark that she was bipolar, rather than be unaware and unable to step in.The proposals do raise questions about bank account holders' privacy and whether a bank should have any kind of role in how customers manage their money.Banks have pointed out to the institute that many customers would have more than one account, making it difficult to gather a comprehensive picture of a customer's finances.There are also data protection rules in place that would make any intervention difficult. The institute wants regulators to publish guidance on how customer data can be used legally and safely.""Barely a week goes by without a news story about how companies are using our personal data, and the impact that's having on our privacy and safety. While these concerns are legitimate, focusing solely on the dangers risks overlooking the enormous opportunity data can present - with the potential to even save lives,"" said Helen Undy, chief executive of the institute.""About 100,000 people in problem debt attempt suicide each year in England, with many suffering in silence and struggling to ask for help.""Something as simple as a bank checking in with a text message if someone's data shows a sudden drop in income, or signposting them to extra support could make all the difference.""Should banks step in when they notice unusual spending habits?

business	Mothercare looks to protect its UK pension schemes	'We are hoping for the best''Good outcome'	"Mothercare is looking to move its UK pension schemes across to its international business in order to help preserve benefits for scheme members.The company is examining a deal that would stop the funds being placed in the UK Pension Protection Fund (PPF).If the pension schemes enter the industry-funded lifeboat it would mean cuts to future retirement benefits.It comes as the troubled retailer is set to formally appoint administrators to its UK business.The administration move would put 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare has said its 79 UK stores are ""not capable"" of achieving a sufficient level of profitability, and that so far it has failed to find a buyer.The firm has two employee pension schemes, which between them have nearly 6,000 members. It is now looking at moving these out of the UK subsidiary.At its most recent actuarial valuation two years ago, Mothercare's pension schemes were £140m in the red.That means if the UK arm goes bust then the PPF would be forced to step in - triggering major cutbacks for pension members.Mothercare has already gone through one rescue deal, in May 2018, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).A CVA is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. The process enabled the chain to shut 55 shops.As part of that move - while it was waiting for approval of that CVA - the two pension schemes temporarily entered the PPF, but exited after a couple of months.Bridget Lock is from Buckinghamshire and in her late 20s. She has worked at Mothercare for almost two years but doesn't know what is going to happen to her job.""We're hoping for the best,"" she says. ""We'll just have to wait and see.""Ms Lock says she ""loves"" her job. ""I joined as a Christmas temp. I think lots of people do that, then end up staying.""She says: ""We've had a loyal customer base. Recently we've seen less customers but we've been really fortunate with our loyal customers.""We've had a lot of people give us positive feedback [but] we all know that our future is not guaranteed.""The UK's Pensions Regulator is understood to have been kept informed about the latest developments.Dan Mindel, managing director at Lincoln Pensions. a covenant advisory business, said: ""Transferring its two employee pension schemes from the UK subsidiary to the group parent company, would certainly be a good outcome for the scheme, especially since the group owns the profitable overseas part of the business.""The pensions industry in general will also be pleased to see members of a retail sector scheme achieve a better outcome than the PPF.""Mothercare's move towards administration comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates."
business	Earnings inequality among men soars	Less secure	"The number of men in low-paid part-time work has increased fourfold over the past 20 years.New research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that one in five low-paid men aged 25 to 55 now work part-time.While 95% of top-earning men normally work full-time, 20% of the lowest paid now work part-time.That means wage inequality for men has risen over two decades, but for women the opposite is the case.More women have had a better education in recent years and more have moved into full-time jobs. As a result their pay has improved and they have had less incentive to leave the workforce.However, the research does not reveal why increasing numbers of low-paid men are working part time.Jonathan Cribb, senior research economist at the IFS and author of the report, said: ""To understand the drivers of inequality in the UK it is vital to understand the growing association between low hourly wages and low hours of work among men.""There are two schools of thought about what might be happening. It may be that increasing numbers of men want to work part-time, although this seems unlikely.The second theory is based on the sectors where these low-paid jobs are found.Six in ten of them are in the retail, wholesale or hospitality sectors.That might suggest men who previously worked in low-paid but secure, full-time jobs in sectors such as manufacturing have lost that type of employment.Instead they have been forced into the traditionally poorly paid and less secure services sector of the economy.Yet those are the sectors of the economy that traditionally have employed large numbers of poorly paid and part-time female workers."
business	Man Utd revenues grow thanks to TV and match-day income	Champions League effect	"Manchester United has announced that total revenues for the three months to October grew by 17.3% to £141m.Broadcasting and match-day revenues leapt more than 30%, while commercial and sponsor income also grew.But the Old Trafford club's income from retail, merchandising, sportswear and product licensing slipped by 0.4% on the previous year.The club also reported a big leap in operating profits, from £6.2m a year ago to £15.2m now.Manchester United is second in the Premier League and poised to qualify for the Champions League knock-out phase. It is also in the last eight of the Carabao League Cup.""We are just over a quarter of the way through what promises to be another exciting season,"" said club executive chairman Ed Woodward.""In the Champions League, we have won all four games played to-date; we are through to the quarter-final of the Carabao Cup and are looking forward to the next few months as the number of matches ramps up.""During the quarterly period, the club took part in a US tour and also signed three new players - Victor Lindelof, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic.Broadcasting revenue was £38.1m, an increase of 30.9%, thanks to participation in the Champions League, playing one extra Premier League home game and participation in the Uefa Super Cup final. But that was partially offset by having one fewer Premier League game broadcast live.Match-day revenue for the quarter was £22.4m, an increase of 33.3% over the previous year, primarily due to playing two additional home games across all competitions.For the total financial year, Manchester United is now predicting total revenues of between £575m and £585m.Meanwhile, total operating expenses for the period were £143.1m, an increase of £20.9m, or 17.1%, on the previous year, largely as a result of additional payments caused by Man Utd qualifying for this season's Champions League.Overall, employee benefit costs rose for the quarter, to £69.9m, an increase of 12.2%.Other operating expenses for the quarter were £34.5m, a hike of 29.2%, over the year before, primarily due to club playing more tour games this year - five, than in the previous season, when they played one and one was postponed.Net debt was £268.1m, a decrease of £69.6m over the year.On player trading, the club made £17.3m through a combination of selling Adnan Januzaj and sell-on clauses for Danny Drinkwater and Michael Keane, who both moved clubs in August."
business	No-deal Brexit would push UK debt to 50-year high, says think tank	Spending rulesGrowth warning	"Even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit would push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said.The think tank said borrowing was likely to rise to £100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income.""The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson.The Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"".The gloomy forecasts are part of the IFS Green Budget, looking at the challenges facing Chancellor Sajid Javid as he prepares for his first Budget.The IFS's Mr Johnson said: ""Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it [the government] should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget.""In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy.""But even before the cost of a possible no-deal Brexit is factored in, the think tank said the government was set to break its own spending rules.The IFS forecasts that annual borrowing - the difference between what the government spends and what it receives through, for example, taxation - will top £50bn next year.That will be about 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of national income. Under current spending rules the government can only borrow up to 2% of national income.The think tank said the government's current plans for day-to-day spending next year are closer to the levels proposed by Labour's 2017 manifesto than plans laid out by the Conservative party at the time.An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""September's spending round supported the people's priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.""Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.""A doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading, in relation to the size of the economy, to the highest government debt since the 1960s.These are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest.On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards £100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century.And all this comes at a time where the institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits.Read more here.In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS said a temporary government spending spree could help to smooth the path for growth, although it would also add to government debt.The think tank forecasts that the debt stock - the total amount of money owed by the government - would climb to almost 90% of national income. It currently stands at about 80%.Even with ""substantial"" government spending, the IFS expects the UK economy to flatline for two years following a no-deal Brexit.It warned that a rise in public spending in 2020 would likely be followed by ""another bust"" as the government would have to deal with ""the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services"".Mr Johnson said that it would be ""crucial"" that government spending programmes were temporary.""An economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more,"" he said.Christian Schulz, the chief UK economist at Citi, which contributed to the report, said: ""The UK economy is already around £60bn smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth.""Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth,"" he said.However, Mr Schulz added that a further Brexit delay would create more uncertainty, denting investment and leaving growth at around 1% a year.""From a growth perspective, a Brexit deal is a little better, leaving growth at 1.5%, but it would leave no chance of Brexit being cancelled,"" he said.""A no-deal Brexit - even with a substantial stimulus - could mean no growth at all for the next two years. Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years."""
business	Pru staff offered spa prizes in pension sale incentives	What is an annuity?'We are deeply sorry'	"Call handlers at the Prudential received spa breaks as prizes for selling annuities - but they were not treating some customers fairly.Sales-linked incentives were offered to staff and managers prior to 2013, but they may not have told customers they could shop around for a better deal.An annuity is a regular pension income bought only once, and for life.The Prudential has been fined nearly £24m for failures when selling them to people who did not receive advice.The company has apologised to those affected and says it is paying compensation, which could total £250m.Individuals save into a pension during their working life and so build up a pension pot.At some point during the first years of retirement, they might use the money that they have saved to buy an annuity from an insurance company.This is a transaction that occurs once, and only once.An annuity is an annual retirement income that is paid to them for the rest of their life.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that between July 2008 and September 2017, Prudential's so-called non-advised annuity business was focused on selling annuities directly to those saving for a pension with the company.Firms are supposed to explain to customers that they might get a better rate if they shop around with other insurers and Prudential was aware that many customers could get a higher income in retirement by looking around, the FCA said.The company did not make sure that customers were informed of that possibility, by failing to ensure call handlers' documents were appropriate and not monitoring calls properly.Before 2013, there were also bonuses of up to 40% and prizes of spa breaks and weekend holidays ""which meant that call handlers might put their own financial interests ahead of ensuring fair customer outcomes"", the FCA said.The company has now, so far, offered approximately £110m in compensation to 17,240 customers, including increases to some ongoing annuities.That bill is estimated to rise to £250m, according to the FCA's ruling.A spokeswoman for the Prudential said: ""We are deeply sorry for the historic failings in our non-advised annuity business and any detriment this has caused our customers. We are working hard to put this right and are on schedule to offer redress to the vast majority of affected customers by the end of October this year.""Our systems and controls have been significantly strengthened in the past two years through a substantial investment in our business. Prudential no longer sells non-advised annuities to most of its customers, following a decision in February 2017 to refer customers to a panel of external providers rather than writing new annuity business."""
business	ONS: Household income falling at fastest rate since 2011		"Real household disposable incomes in the UK are falling at their steepest rate since 2011, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said.The amount that families have to spend - after tax and benefits are taken into account - fell by 2% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 2016.The ONS said that was the biggest decline for more than five years.It added that the main reason for the fall was the rise in inflation, which hit 2.3% in the year to March.The real household disposable income measure is adjusted for inflation, meaning that rises in the cost of living result in lower disposable income.Over the same period, wages rose by just 2.1%.The fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote has increased the cost of imports, including food, so boosting inflation.Real household income per head has now fallen for three months in a row - the first time that has happened since 2013.The TUC said the government needed to create better-paid jobs.""It's official. Britons are getting poorer,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary.""Having just lived through the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, their living standards are in freefall again. The government cannot sit on its hands and watch this crisis unfold.""However, a different measure of income, which reflects the wider strength of the economy, showed an improvement.Net national income per head - the economy's earnings divided by the number of adults - rose by 4.3% in the year to the end of March. This was because of an increase in earnings from abroad, also driven by a fall in the value of sterling."
business	Homes cost more than seven times income	'Quickest sales'Most and least affordable	"Working people typically face house prices of more than seven times their annual earnings as affordability is increasingly stretched.The typical property cost 7.6 times average annual earnings of employees in England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.The aftermath of the financial crisis saw affordability levels plateau.But now buyers face paying a record multiple of earnings as the affordability gap widens.In 2007, the typical buyer faced paying 7.2 times their earnings on a property, but this was surpassed in 2015 (7.4 times) and again in 2016 (7.6 times).The official figures will make gloomy reading for potential first-time buyers whose wages have stagnated and who now see property ownership become comparatively more expensive.However, borrowing costs are at historic lows with banks and building societies cutting interest rates on mortgages to attract customers.A recent report by Shelter suggested that nearly eight out of 10 families across England are unable to afford newly built homes in their local area.Northampton is the fastest-moving property market in the UK, according to analysis of listings on a property portal.Zoopla calculated the length of time that properties were listed on its website before being marked as under offer.Typically, among towns and cities across the country, properties in Northampton were listed for the shortest amount of time, 27 days.Milton Keynes (29 days) and Croydon (30 days) were next on the list.Regionally, properties on the site came under offer fastest in the South East of England and the East of England (42 days) compared with the longest - Wales - which took 66 days.The ONS figures show that London hosts seven of the 10 least affordable areas to buy a property in England and Wales last year.In Kensington and Chelsea, the typical property costs 38 times the average annual income of residents in the area. In 1999, a home cost 13 times typical earnings.Buyers in Westminster had to pay 24 times typical earnings for the area last year, and it was 21 times multiple in Hammersmith and Fulham.At the other end of the scale, buyers Copeland in Cumbria had to pay 2.8 times typical local earnings for a home.Next on the affordability list were the Welsh council areas of Neath Port Talbot and Blaenau Gwent (both 3.6 times).Property commentator Henry Pryor argues that affordability levels are less relevant for some buyers.""Up to 40% of buyers do not have a mortgage, they are cash buyers for whom affordability isn't an issue and for whom there is no link to their income,"" he said.""Half of people who own a home have no borrowings. The unearned and largely untaxed money they have made simply by living in their property isn't recorded in inflation figures but it is a significant part of what maintains house prices and drives the economy.""Roger Harding, of Shelter, said: ""The only way to fix the housing crisis is for the government to get behind a different way of building that brings down the cost of land."""
business	Manchester United annual revenues hit record high of £627m	'Rebuilding'Player wages	"Revenues at Manchester United have hit a record £627m for the year to July.This was despite the football club enduring a ""turbulent season"" in 2018-19 that saw the departure of manager Jose Mourinho and the team finish sixth in the Premier League.Broadcast revenue soared by 18% thanks to a new Uefa Champions League deal, while commercial income was flat.But the team expects revenue and profit to fall in 2019-20 after it failed to make the Champions League this season.The New York-listed club is currently eighth in the UK's Premier League after a flat start to the campaign.That leaves it 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, and five points behind cross-town rivals and reigning champions Manchester City.There is now a danger of the club falling behind their traditional rivals in mainland Europe for the right to be branded the world's richest. Last week, Spanish giant Barcelona announced it expected to pass the €1bn ($1.1bn; £883m) income mark for the first time this season.Despite the record revenues executive, Manchester United's vice-chairman Ed Woodward said the club still valued playing success on the field most highly.He said: ""We remain focused on our plan of rebuilding the team and continuing to strengthen our youth system, in line with the philosophy of the club and the manager.""Everyone at Manchester United is committed to delivering on our primary objective of winning trophies.""For the current financial year he forecast revenue of £560m to £580m, down from £627.1m, and core profit of £155m to £165m, down from £185.8m.The club said that during the past year it had signed three new first team players and completed several key player contract extensions.It said it had also announced 10 new or renewed global sponsorship deals, and that - as measured by Kantar - its total number of fans and followers globally had increased to 1.1 billion.During the year the Old Trafford club also made an operating profit of £50m.Staff wages for the year, mostly spent on players, were £332.3m, an increase of £36.m, or 12.3%, on the previous year, ""primarily due to investment in the first team squad"".The club spent more than half of its income on player wages, despite a campaign in which no trophies were won."
business	IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva warns of 'painful' Brexit	Trade war'Bigger loser'	"The new head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Brexit in whatever form will be ""painful"", adding to the effects of a global slowdown.Kristalina Georgieva said the split will hurt not only the UK and European Union, but also low income countries with economic ties to them.IMF data show that growth has already slowed in almost 90% of the world.""It is very obvious that this [Brexit] is going to be painful,"" she told the BBC.Ms Georgieva said UK politicians will have to figure out how to shield people hurt by Brexit - but the options available to fund those measures are limited.""The choices are not that many - you either borrow or you look at the [tax] increase,"" she said.Ms Georgieva, who spoke to the BBC ahead of the IMF's annual meeting in Washington next week, said the IMF is also concerned about the effect of Brexit outside of the UK.""I particularly worry about low-income countries that are in a significant way dependent on the European Union and the UK,"" she said.""Unfortunately this is not great news,"" she said of Brexit. ""And it comes at a time of compounded other factors that slow down growth.""The US and China are locked in a trade war over state subsidies and technology theft that has led the two sides to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods.US President Donald Trump has also picked fights with allies such as Europe and Canada over cars, steel and aluminium.The disputes have brought trade growth to a ""near standstill"" and hurt manufacturing and business investment, Ms Georgieva said.In 2020, the IMF predicts that they will knock almost 1% off of global growth in 2020 - or roughly $700bn.""What is most significant is that it is not the direct impacts of tariffs that are most harmful. Most harmful is the loss of confidence,"" Ms Georgieva said.The White House has said the tariffs are meant to force China to change its policies and dismissed concerns about growth, arguing that any harm to the US pales in comparison to the damage on China.""That is not a good excuse if you can say, you know what, I'm a loser, but you're a bigger loser than me,"" Ms Georgieva said.""I don't think that this is what people expect from leadership."""
business	Drugs firms reach $260m US opioid settlement		"Four drugs companies have reached a $260m (£200m) deal with two Ohio counties over their role in fuelling the US opioid crisis.The agreement averts a trial that had been scheduled to start in Cleveland.The counties had been seeking billions from Israel-based drugmaker Teva and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson.A trial for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which had also been accused, will be rescheduled.The last-minute deal was announced on Monday by the judge overseeing the trial in Cleveland.Talks over a bigger settlement, which would have resolved claims brought by thousands of other cities, counties and states, had collapsed on Friday.The companies, which have denied wrongdoing, are accused of ignoring suspicious orders and downplaying the risks of opioid painkillers, which have been linked to about 400,000 overdose deaths in the US between 1997 and 2017.In Monday's deal, they did not admit guilt. But McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Corp agreed to pay $215m, while Teva is paying $20m and will contribute $25m worth of treatment medication.Later on Monday, Teva also said it had reached an ""agreement in principle"" for a global settlement, which would see it pay $250m and donate treatment medication worth an estimated $23bn over 10 years.The case involving Ohio's Summit and Cuyahoga counties had been closely watched as the first of thousands of similar ones to go forward.The two jurisdictions have already struck deals worth more than $66m with firms that include Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma and Allergan.Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish called Monday's deal ""a very good development"" that will provide money for recovery programmes and other assistance.""This settlement helps us address the mitigation of the terrible damage that's been caused,"" he said. ""There's still more to go. And we're going to continue to work on it.""The opioid crisis cost the US more than $630bn from 2015 through 2018 in healthcare and policing expense, lost income and other costs, according to recent estimates by the US Society of Actuaries."
business	Average income 'hits new peak'		"The average income in the UK moved above its 2009-10 peak in 2014-15, official figures show, owing to a rise in the number of people in work.The mid-point net income of all households in the UK was up 3% after inflation.That meant average income before housing costs reached £473 per week - around £24,600 a year, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said.This income had fallen during the financial crisis.There was little change in the gap between rich and poor, as has been the case since 2011-12, the figures showed.However, the data revealed that on one measure child poverty had increased, and in two other measures it was unchanged in 2014-15 compared with the previous year.""Child poverty isn't inevitable - the government needs to invest in our children so we can all share the rewards of a stronger economy and a fairer society,"" said Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group.Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ""There is of course still more to do and that is why our Life Chances Strategy will look at the root causes of poverty whether that is worklessness, debt or addiction, family breakdown or educational attainment. It is only by doing this that we can truly tackle poverty and ensure everyone succeeds in life."""
business	Savings ratio at record low as disposable income drops, says ONS	Tax effect'Never-ending battle'	"The proportion of UK residents' disposable income that goes into savings has fallen to a record low.The savings ratio - which measures the outgoings and incomings that affect households - has been falling sharply for more than a year.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the ratio stood at 1.7% from January to March, down from 3.3% in the previous quarter.The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, the ONS said.This was unchanged from an earlier estimate but confirmed the slowdown from the 0.7% rate seen in the final quarter of last year.Growth in the business services and finance sectors helped to offset slower consumer spending, the ONS said.Consumer spending and saving were hit by another fall in disposable income.For the first time since the 1970s, disposable income has fallen for three quarters in a row.Concerns have also been expressed about the level of consumer borrowing on loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car finance.But the ONS also said that the timing of tax payments was a major factor in the cut in savings levels since September last year. Gross saving of £5.6bn in the first quarter of the year was a sharp drop from £11bn the previous quarter, and £17.7bn in the three months before that.Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""The saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income.""Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio.""Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ""These figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy.""But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. With household debt now at crisis levels, we urgently need to create better paid jobs.""Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""This suggests that the crisis in earnings not keeping up with prices means that many working households are struggling to make ends meet.""Vince Cable, from the Liberal Democrats, said: ""Rising prices and falling wages since the Brexit vote mean families are increasingly unable to live within their means or save for the future.""Our economy's reliance on consumer spending, propped up by debt, is not sustainable and combined with an extreme Brexit the consequences could be severe.""Earlier this week, financial information service Moneyfacts said that savers have faced a ""never-ending battle"" to get a decent return on their cash over the past few years.Nine out of 10 easy access savings accounts pay interest of less than 1%, and a third of such accounts failed to even pay a rate matching the current base rate of 0.25%.Savings rates are failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living, with inflation at a rate of 2.9%."
business	UK government borrowing up by a fifth over past six months		"Public sector borrowing has risen by a fifth during the first half of the financial year, official figures show.Borrowing for the six months to September has now hit £40.3bn, up £7.4bn from the same period in 2018.In the month of September, borrowing was £9.4bn - slightly lower than expected but still up from £8.8bn last year.The figures raise questions about the chancellor's room to manoeuvre in next month's Budget.Sajid Javid has said he is ""turning the page on austerity"" and promised big spending rises in his November statement.But John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Today's data showed the UK public finances heading further into the red, with the deficit more than £7bn higher in the first half of this financial year than the same period last year.""This borrowing overshoot will not make the chancellor's choices any easier as he heads towards his first Budget on 6 November.""According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the borrowing figures for September mark the first annual rise in that month for five years.The increase comes despite the government receiving a £1.1bn dividend boost last month from part-nationalised lender Royal Bank of Scotland.The ONS said borrowing was pushed higher due to seasonal payments of £2bn for winter fuel and £2.7bn of student loan write-offs - both of which are recorded in September each year.Mr Javid plans to set out new long-term fiscal rules in next month's Budget.Currently the rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, but most expect him to relax this.""September's better-than-expected public finance figures do not change this year's overarching themes of higher spending and borrowing. If anything, today's release will only encourage the chancellor to loosen fiscal policy at the Budget next month,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.""We already know that the chancellor wants to review the fiscal rules in the Budget on 6 November, as there is very little chance of hitting the current ones.""We don't know what the new fiscal rules will be, but they are likely to allow for a substantial loosening of fiscal policy at the Budget, which would support economic growth. Of course, whether this happens depends on whether there is a Brexit deal."""
business	IMF warns world growth slowest since financial crisis	Global downgradeDownside risksAnalysis:	"The global economy is growing at its slowest pace since the financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.The fund said world growth would hit just 3% this year - down from its July forecast of 3.2% and a sharp slowdown from just two years ago.The IMF blamed the slowdown on trade fights, Brexit uncertainty and other geopolitical crises.It added there is an ""urgent"" need for leaders to de-escalate the tensions.""The global outlook remains precarious,"" the international lending body said in its annual report. ""At 3% growth, there is no room for policy mistakes.""The IMF, which downgraded its forecasts for most of the world, predicted that growth in advanced economies would slow from 2.3% in 2018 to 1.7% this year.In the US, where an economic boost from a 2017 tax cut has faded, the fund expects growth to pull back from 2.9% last year to 2.4% in 2019.In the UK, where Brexit-related worries have hurt investment, growth is forecast at 1.2% for 2019, down from 1.4% last year.In Germany, which is reeling from a downturn in car production, growth is predicted at 0.5%, down from 1.5% in 2018.China's economic growth is expected to slow from 6.6% to 6.1%. It has been hit by efforts to rein in risky debt and the trade war with the US, which led the IMF to shave almost a percentage point off global growth.Thus far, the IMF said central banks have managed to blunt the impact of the slowdown with tools such as low interest rates. Without those stimulus policies, it estimates that the growth rate would have been 0.5 percentage points lower this year.""With central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,"" the fund said.The World Trade Organization also recently downgraded its economic outlook, citing trade wars, Brexit and other factors.The IMF said the global economy could grow faster in 2020, at 3.4%. However, it warned that risks are ""skewed to the downside"", noting that the pickup depends on improvements in India, as well as several economies currently under severe strain, such as Argentina, Turkey and Iran.""Policy missteps at this juncture, such as a no-deal Brexit or a further deepening of trade disputes, could severely undermine sentiment, growth, and job creation,"" it said. ""The foremost priority, in many cases, is to remove policy-induced uncertainty or threats to growth.""By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondentWhat can policymakers do to tackle the global economic slowdown? The commentary from the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, has something to say about three major policy tools.Trade policy is the obvious one. The IMF blames much of the weakening outlook on trade tensions so you would expect a call to reverse the tariff increases imposed by several countries, notably the US.That does indeed top Ms Gopinath's list. Central banks have already taken steps - interest rate cuts and other measures. She describes these moves as spending limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes.She warns that central banks may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot. It's a worry that has been bubbling for several years before the recent escalation of trade tensions as central banks reached for new ideas in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.Ms Gopinath argues this cannot be the ""only game in town"". Governments that can afford it - she mentions Germany, in particular - should cut taxes or increase spending. And she says if things get worse, an internationally co-ordinated response along these lines might be required."

I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support.""Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said ""all viable options"" for saving the travel giant should be explored.She added that ""the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis"".BBC business editor Simon Jack reported on Saturday that government sources had questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company.He said the government did not see its options as being between spending £200m to help Thomas Cook with its cash shortfall or £600m to repatriate its British customers abroad.Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British.Chloe Hardy from Leicestershire is due to get married in Zante in October and booked the wedding package with Thomas Cook back in June 2018.Chloe and her fiance will also have 33 family members flying out, with their trips costing more than £33,000 in total.With the big day looming, Chloe is frustrated by Thomas Cook's handling of their booking.""I have emailed the wedding concierge and co-ordinator, neither has got back to me.

The £900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors.The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional £200m on top of the £900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to £1.1bn.Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional £200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found.A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding.Thomas Cook has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme.If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.Here is more information on Atol protection and Your questions answeredAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?

Under our process the partner has appealed.""KPMG refused to comment further on what the ""conduct issues"" involved.Mr Howarth told the Financial Times - which first reported the story - that he was ""surprised"" KPMG had announced the outcome of its disciplinary panel.""[It] is bizarre as the decision is under appeal. I have not been given the reason for that decision. I had already resigned from the KPMG partnership.""I did not believe that the process was fair or would lead to a just outcome. There is no complainant and there were no formal allegations pursued by anyone,"" he said.Mr Howarth led one of the firm's most important divisions, which generates large amounts of revenue for the company.His profile has now been removed from the firm's website.His dismissal comes as the firm - best known for its accountancy work - tries to restore its reputation following a series of unrelated auditing scandals.In May, KPMG was fined £5m and ""severely reprimanded"" after admitting misconduct in its 2009 audit of Co-operative Bank.In April, it was fined £6m, received another severe reprimand, and was told to undertake an internal review of the way it audited insurance company Syndicate 218 in 2008 and 2009.Regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), is also investigating the accountancy giant's audit of the government contractor Carillion, which collapsed under £1bn of debt last year.Last year, the FRC said it had found an ""unacceptable deterioration"" in KPMG's work and said it would be subject to closer supervision.KPMG is one of the four largest auditors in the UK, the so called ""big four"" which also includes PwC, EY and Deloitte.All four are currently under review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has proposed an internal split between their audit and non-audit businesses to prevent conflicts of interest in audits.Last year, KPMG said it would no longer do consultancy work for the UK's biggest companies if it was also auditing them, in order to ""remove even the perception of a possible conflict"" of interest."

Two billionaire press barons now own half of the top 10 daily newspapers.

Remember this when they attack Labour's plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share.End of Twitter post by @jeremycorbynThe i was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to the Independent. It sells for 65p on weekdays and £1.20 on Saturdays.When it first hit the newsstands, executives at the company said it was aimed at ""time-poor newspaper readers"", especially commuters, who lacked the time to read a quality newspaper on a regular basis.At its launch, it shared the same editorial staff as its sister paper and was seen as a way of extending the Independent's brand to a new market.But in 2016, the Independent closed its print edition and the i was sold for £24m to Johnston Press.Despite this, links to the paper's former parent remained, with the i continuing to provide a print home for some of the Independent's now otherwise digital-only content.In November 2018, the i changed hands again after Johnston Press was bought out of administration by JPI Media.DMGT had been mulling the purchase for at least a year, but was beaten by JPI Media's deal with administrators.Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK with a history dating back more than 250 years, but it had debts of £220m.The deal leaves JPI with The Scotsman and Yorkshire Post among its biggest titles. In total, it owns about 200 newspaper brands.If the DMGT deal is approved, the UK's national newspapers will be owned by just six companies.DMGT already owns the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro.Reach, formerly known as Trinity Mirror, owns the Daily Mirror, Sunday People, Daily Express, Daily Star and associated Sunday titles.News UK, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp, owns the Times, Sunday Times and Sun.The Telegraph Media Group, owned by billionaire brothers Sir Fredrick and Sir David Barclay, owns the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph.The Guardian Media Group owns the Guardian and Observer.And the Financial Times is owned by Japanese media firm Nikkei, after being sold by UK publishing group Pearson in 2015."
business	Sexist and biased? How credit firms make decisions	How are our lives affected?So are these algorithms biased?What can be done about this issue?	"Jamie Heinemeier Hansson had a better credit score than her husband, tech entrepreneur David. They have equal shares in their property and file joint tax returns.Yet David was given permission to borrow 20 times the amount on his Apple Card than his wife was granted.The situation was far from unique. Even Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite having no separate bank accounts or separate assets.The same thing happened to us. We have no separate bank accounts or credit cards or assets of any kind. We both have the same high limits on our cards, including our AmEx Centurion card. But 10x on the Apple Card.End of Twitter post by @stevewozThe case has caused a stink in the US. Regulators are investigating. Politicians have criticised Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card, for its response.What the saga has highlighted is concern over the role of machine-learning and algorithms - the rules of computer calculations - in making decisions that are clearly sexist, racist or discriminatory in other ways.Society tends to assume - wrongly - that computers are impartial machines that do not discriminate because they cannot think like humans.The reality is that the historic data they process, and perhaps the programmers who feed or create them, are themselves biased, often unintentionally. Equally, machines can draw conclusions without asking explicit questions (such as discriminating between men and women despite not asking for gender information).A whole range of issues in our daily lives have been changed, and undoubtedly improved, by the use of computer algorithms - from transport and technology to shopping and sport.Arguably, the clearest and most direct impact is on our financial lives. Banks and other lenders use machine-learning technology to assess loan applications, including mortgages. The insurance industry is dominated by machines' conclusions of levels of risk.For the consumer, the algorithm is central in deciding how much they have to pay for something, or whether they are even allowed to have that product at all.Take insurance: the so-called ""postcode lottery"" comes from the fact that an algorithm will decide why two people with identical properties and with an identical security system will pay different amounts for their home insurance.The algorithm uses postcodes to look up the crime rates in those areas, and subsequently makes a judgement on the likelihood of a property being burgled and sets the premium accordingly.With credit scores, any machine's conclusion on how reliable you are at repaying can affect anything from access to a mobile phone contract to where you can rent a home.In the Apple Card case, we do not know how how the algorithm makes its decisions or which data it uses, but this could include historic data on which sorts of people are considered more financially risky, or who have traditionally made applications for credit.Goldman Sachs, which operates the Apple Card, says it does not even ask applicants their gender, race, age and so on - it would be illegal to do so. Decisions were, therefore, not based on whether they were a man or a woman.However, this ignores what Rachel Thomas, director of the USF Center for Applied Data Ethics in San Francisco, calls ""latent variables"".""Even if race and gender are not inputs to your algorithm, it can still be biased on these factors,"" she wrote in a thread on Twitter.For example, an algorithm will not know someone's gender, but it may know you are a primary school teacher - a female-dominated industry. Historic data, most controversially in crime and justice, may be drawn from a time when human decisions by police or judges were affected by somebody's race.The machine learns and replicates conclusions from the past that may be biased.It will also be worse at processing data it has not seen before. Someone who is not white or has a strong regional accent may be not be so well recognised by automated facial or voice recognition software which has mostly been ""trained"" on data taken from white people with no regional accents - a source of anger for some ringing a call centre.The impartiality, or otherwise, of algorithms has been a hotly-debated issue for some time, with relatively little consensus.One option is for businesses to be completely open about how those algorithms are set. However, these products are valuable commercial property, developed over years by highly-skilled, well-paid individuals. They will not want to just give their secrets away.Most retailers, for example, would be delighted to be handed Amazon's algorithms for free.Another option is algorithmic transparency - telling a customer why a decision has been made, and which elements of their data were the most significant. Yet, there is little agreement on the best way to set out such information.One answer could be more algorithms based on less specific information.Jason Sahota, chief executive of Charles Taylor InsureTech, which provides software for the insurance industry, says there is an increasing use of pooled policies. An insurer may offer group health cover via an employer for a certain group of workers. Those insured do not need to fill out individual forms, as the insurer assesses their risk as a whole.He says that consumers' demand for fewer clicks and quicker payouts was happening as the insurance underwriting process was being simplified.Stripping out too much data would make it difficult to differentiate applicants and policies, which would lead to homogenised products that would cost more.Instead, Mr Sahota argues that people should be told why information is asked for and how it is used.If something is found to be unintentionally biased, then - rather than simply blaming the data - he says it is important to do something to find a way to overcome the problem."

business	Financial sharks circling Metro Bank	Capital calculationsSense of funA gamble	"Although Metro Bank recently came top of a consumer satisfaction league table, financial sharks are circling the challenger bank.Metro Bank is now the second most shorted company on the UK stock market.That means a lot of financial firms are betting the bank's shares will continue to fall - despite having already lost 80% of their value in the last 12 months.Ever since Metro Bank revealed it had made an error in calculating how much shock absorbing capital it was holding, there have been some serious questions in the minds of regulators about the bank's operating competence and in the minds of investors about its basic business model.So what's been going on?Earlier this year the financial regulator, the PRA, raised concerns with the bank about inconsistencies in the reports it was submitting.It soon emerged that the bank had miscalculated the capital it needed to support some of its commercial lending. The news sent the bank's shares down nearly 40% in one day as the bank said it would need to raise more capital by selling new shares.Miscalculating the amount of capital you have or need to support your lending is one of the most fundamental mistakes a bank can make.The bank's capital is a financial cushion to make sure that depositors' money is safe even if some of the borrowers can't pay back their loans.One banking veteran told the BBC that it was ""staggering, beggared belief"" that a bank could get such a basic thing so wrong. ""Operating with insufficient capital is the cardinal sin that brought us the financial crisis"".Metro Bank is clear that it had sufficient capital to support its current lending but analysts told the BBC that future growth plans also need to be supported as it planned to grow faster than it could earn additional money to support future lending.The amount of capital a bank needs is calculated by adding together three elements - or pillars - as they are known.Pillar one is the basic minimum capital calculation based on how much lending you have done and in which markets - the more you do, the riskier the types of loans - the more you need.Pillar two is the regulators assessment of bank specific risk. It's a qualitative measure that looks at the bank's size, maturity and operating history.Pillar three is the amount you need to support future growth.This is an important one for Metro which was trying to grow at 30% per year - which would require more additional capital than the bank could earn along the way.Well, those plans have changed. As Metro Bank licks its wounds after an embarrassing mistake, it has had to scale down its ambitions.It is now targeting growth of 20% rather than 30% - and that looks ambitious given the bank will be spending a considerable amount of money and management time dealing with two regulatory probes from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.So far - no heads have rolled as a result of the capital blunder. The chief executive Craig Donaldson offered to resign but the board did not accept it.Sources at the company told the BBC there was no appetite for ""a witch hunt"" but investors and regulators may need some blood on the carpet to satisfy them.If the chief executive stays, the focus then shifts to the board and here is another area where investors are concerned that Metro Bank is falling short of the standards required of a bank.The chairman and founder Vernon Hill is an engaging and charismatic figure whose mould breaking approach to banking was seen by many as a breath of fresh air.I was present at the launch of the first UK Metro Bank in Holborn, London nearly 10 years ago. There was razzmatazz, balloons, bands, Saturday, Sunday and Bank holiday opening hours and dog bowls and biscuits - thanks to the influence of Vernon Hill's wife Shirley and her ever present companion Duffy the Yorkshire Terrier.So what? Just what the High Street needs - a bank that's open when you want it to be with a sense of fun about it.Customers liked it. What investors were unsure about was the £21m Metro Bank paid to Shirley Hill's company InterArch for its design work.Royal London Asset Management and Glass Lewis - a firm that advises shareholders how to vote - both described the relationship as ""inappropriate"" and voted against Vernon Hill's re-election as chairman. They were convincingly outvoted.Many of the board have been there a long time - a practice that is increasingly frowned upon as it can foster cosy relationships between the board and the management - leading to insufficient challenge and scrutiny.Six of its nine non-executive directors have been on the board almost since day one - nine years ago - coincidentally the maximum recommended term for a director under the company governance code.Even if, as seems likely, there is a boardroom clear out, doubts still remain in the minds of some about the underlying business model.After all, Metro Bank is trying to do the exact opposite of what many other banks are doing.It is growing its network of branches while others are shrinking theirs. It is opening in the most expensive locations in the towns and cities it operates in. Its branches are open Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays.Sometimes doing something counter-intuitive or a bit different is good. Sometimes there is a reason that no-one else is doing it. For many investors, it's a case of the latter.One former shareholder said there were two important reasons why. First, this Metro Bank model ""will only ever appeal to a subset of customers - it is never going to be the same scale as even a TSB let alone a Lloyds and that matters because you can't get the cost as percentage of your revenue down without scale.It will always be a more expensive business and therefore lower returning business to own"".Second, the rate of growth they are targeting means that for the next few years you are paying to own this company rather than being paid.The bank will continue to need more capital put in by shareholders and that is a gamble for a niche bank that is expensive to run.The chief executive Craig Donaldson insists that comparisons with the rest of the industry tell a misleading story.""You have to remember that RBS is coming down from over 2,000 branches, we are heading up from the current 66 to a target of 200. That is the size of business we are targeting.""As mentioned already, Metro Bank has proved popular with customers and has shown impressive growth with minimal advertising. To be clear there is no suggestion that customer deposits are at any risk.But the model is not winning the popularity contest with investors - its shares have fallen nearly 80% and some heavyweight financial gamblers are betting heavily on it falling further.In the final analysis, no amount of razzmatazz and dog biscuits can take investors eyes off the financial ball and right now it is a long way from being in the back of the net.One to watch."

business	Would you rent a vacuum cleaner for $499 a month?	'Cleaning efficiency'WeWork rescue	"Vacuum cleaning is a chore many people are happy to outsource, but one company is trying to persuade firms to swap an automated service for human cleaners.Softbank, the Japanese firm behind WeWork and Uber, has launched a self-powered machine, dubbed The Whiz, at a hefty price tag of $499 (£381) a month.Softbank says its robot is meant to replace ""over-worked janitorial teams.""The Whiz is not initially automatic, as a human has to lead it around until it can learn the cleaning route.It has been developed by Softbank's US robotics arm and Hong Kong-based firm Intelligent Cleaning Equipment.The three-feet-tall (0.9 metres) vacuum was initially only offered for rent in Japan and Hong Kong.The machine sends an alert if there is an issue, such as bumping into a wall. After three hours, it can cover 15,000 square feet (1,394 square metres) but then will need a battery change.It also gathers data and produces a report with analytics on dirt levels.Softbank says in its presentation materials this provides the ability to ""actively demonstrate cleaning efficiency to stakeholders"".One UK firm told the BBC they were planning to conduct trials with the robot in hotels around Southampton.Ellen Gasson, marketing director for Hampshire-based Industrial Cleaning Equipment (a different business from the Hong Kong company), says when they trial the machine in hotels, a cleaner will need to be present to allow the robot into rooms to clean floors.The vacuum cleaner launch comes after tech investor Softbank announced its worst ever financial results, earlier in November.Softbank reported a £5bn operating loss for the second quarter of 2019, after companies it invested in, Uber and WeWork, suffered poor financial performances.WeWork, a flexible office space company had to be given a multi-billion dollar rescue package. Its chief executive Adam Neumann, departed and was replaced with Softbank executives.Despite the negative recent press, some analysts remain positive on Softbank and see the company's stock as undervalued.""The WeWork debacle has eroded investor confidence but we retain our strong conviction regarding the long-term outlook for the company,"" said Chris Lane, an analyst at Bernstein in a research note."
business	Government ‘never met’ Seaborne Freight's financial backers	'Carefully vetted'	"The Department for Transport (DfT) held no face-to-face meetings with the backers of the ferry-less shipping firm Seaborne Freight, the BBC has learned.A Freedom of Information request unveiled that no officials or ministers met Arklow Shipping, the Irish firm that eventually withdrew its support for a route between Kent and Belgium.It also uncovered that no DfT ministers met Seaborne at any point.But the government stressed that many emails and phone calls were exchanged.Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the revelations were ""astonishing"", and added that it was ""difficult to imagine how [the contracts] could have been handled any worse"".The DfT said it was not normal practice for government ministers to meet representatives of all the companies it has contracts with.""To suggest that ministers should have personally met with interested parties during a procurement process is ridiculous and belies a fundamental misunderstanding of procurement rules and procedure. Such an action would be wholly inappropriate,"" it added.Arklow confirmed their backing of Seaborne in writing to the DfT and the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling.Seaborne Freight was awarded a £13.8m contract in December 2018 to run a freight service to mainland Europe, in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, and congestion builds up at ports such as Dover.The government was criticised for choosing Seaborne - which the BBC found had never sailed a vessel - as a supplier, and for leaving too little time for a full public procurement process.The DfT said it awarded the contract ""in the full knowledge"" that Seaborne, which was formed in April 2017, was ""a new shipping provider"", and said the company had been ""carefully vetted"".Mr Grayling told the House of Commons that ""due diligence was carried out into the participants in this business and no reason was found why they should not contract with government"".In February, the government axed its contract with Seaborne, after Arklow removed its backing.Earlier this month, the government paid £33m to Eurotunnel to settle a lawsuit over the hurried manner in which the contracts to Seaborne, and to established shipping firms DFDS and Brittany Ferries, were awarded."
business	Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush	Pawnbroking unaffected	"The head of Britain's biggest pawnbroker has said regulation on cash loans risks pushing some people to loan sharks ahead of Christmas.It comes after H&T revealed that the City watchdog was reviewing the short term cash loans it offered and could ask it to pay compensation.Boss John Nichols said the firm would work with regulators but that its cash-strapped customers would be affected.It has stopped offering short term cash loans while the review is carried out.Mr Nichols said he hoped these cash loans, which are separate to pawnbroking and typically amounted to about £500, would be available again from January.He admitted that the timing was a concern for the business, with pre-Christmas a busy time for giving short-term loans, and had come ""a bit out of the blue"" from the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).""The unintended consequence is that people could go to unregulated lenders,"" he said.Regulation of short-term, high-interest cash loans has had a significant impact on the credit industry in recent years - particularly among big payday lenders, some of which have collapsed. Regulators have introduced stricter rules on ensuring that loans should only be given to those who can afford to repay.The company is working with the FCA to review its affordability checks for loans over the last six years, which Mr Nichols suggested had previously been given a clean bill of health.They relate to cash loans, sold from H&T stores, which typically required repayment within six to 12 months. Such loans would have relatively high interest, as they were available to people who might struggle to be accepted for a loan from the bank.Over the past six years the company said total customer interest payments were £24m. The review will consider whether any compensation should be paid.It said: ""Should any redress be payable, H&T anticipates being able to fund this from its existing financial resources.""Although the company said this area of its business only accounted for 4% of revenues, its shares fell by 25% in early trading before recovering later in the morning.The pawnbroking arm of the business, one of the biggest in the UK, is unaffected. This will be a relief to some customers who were shifted over from rival Albemarle & Bond (A&B) when the latter collapsed in early September.Many were taken by surprise when A&B abruptly ceased trading, blaming ""significant"" financial losses. Some even feared goods such as jewellery and gold would never be returned.But H&T agreed to buy £8m worth of loans linked to customers' belongings - known as ""pledge books"" - from Speedloan Finance, which had traded under the name Albemarle & Bond.The deal meant customers of A&B could redeem or extend their existing loans at H&T's 248 UK pawn shops."
business	Alibaba backs Hong Kong's 'bright' future with huge listing	Growing unrest	"Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang has praised Hong Kong's ""bright"" future as the Chinese e-commerce giant prepares to list in the embattled financial hub.The firm, which is already traded in the US, hopes to raise up to $13.4bn (£10.4bn) in its secondary listing.That would make it the biggest share sale this year, according to Dealogic.The move is seen as a boost for Hong Kong, diluting fears that protests have tarnished its financial reputation.The city has grappled with anti-government protests for nearly five months and violent clashes escalated this week .""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Alibaba Chairman Daniel Zhang said.He described the city as ""one of the world's most important financial centres"".Mr Zhang - who succeeded Jack Ma to take Alibaba's top job earlier this year - said the company hoped to ""contribute"" to the future of Hong Kong.The company will offer 500 million shares, priced at up to HK$188 ($24) each for retail investors. Shares are due to start trading on 26 November.The sale could knock Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May.Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence.The company said the new listing will allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region.The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory.The move to go ahead with the share sale in Hong Kong comes after Alibaba reportedly delayed plans to list there earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war.The long-running protests have hurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, and knocked business confidence in the city.The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."
business	1MDB: Superyacht linked to financial scandal sold for $126m		"Malaysia's government has agreed to sell a seized superyacht allegedly bought with money stolen from the 1MDB state fund for $126m (£95.9m).The sale of the yacht to casino firm Genting Malaysia marks the country's largest recovery yet of 1MDB cash.Billions of dollars were allegedly embezzled from 1MDB, which was set up in 2009 to aid economic development.It comes as Malaysia's ex-PM Najib Razak faces his first trial over his role in the sweeping financial scandal.He denies any wrongdoing.US authorities say money siphoned from 1MDB was used to buy lavish assets including a private jet, paintings, real estate -and the luxury yacht, Equanimity.Businessman Low Taek Jho, a key figure in the scandal, allegedly purchased the superyacht which was confiscated by authorities in 2018.On Wednesday, a court approved its sale to Genting Malaysia for $126m.The price also fell well short of the $250m reportedly paid by Mr Low.Mr Low said ""the bargain-basement sale price"" reflected the treatment of the boat by the Malaysian government which he claimed had not stored it properly and had reduced its sale price.""Proceeds from the sale have been further eroded by expenditure on the vessel's upkeep - reportedly some US$3.5m,"" he said in a statement, issued by his lawyers.Equanimity - decked out with a 20m swimming pool, spa and sauna, movie theatre and helipad - has been moored off the coast of Malaysia for the past five months, on show for potential buyers.The Malaysian government said the pool of buyers was small, and while many offers were received, only a few topped $100m.The Chinese-Malaysian financier has been portrayed by Malaysian and US investigators as one of the masterminds of the 1MDB scam.US prosecutors say Mr Low leveraged his powerful political connections to win business for 1MDB through the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes."
business	Google set to offer banking current accounts	PartnershipsLagging China'Darwinian experiment'	"Google has become the latest big tech firm to move into banking by offering current accounts.The firm said it plans to partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer the ""smart checking"" accounts.It said the service, to be launched via Google Pay, will allow users to add Google's analytic tools to traditional banking products.The move follows offerings of credit cards, payment systems and loans by Facebook, Uber, Apple and Amazon.While the products and arrangements differ, the tech giants entering the world of banking share an underlying motive: making themselves indispensable, says Gerard du Toit, a partner at the Bain & Co consulting firm.""They're all competing for consumer attention and for their ecosystem and platform to win,"" he says.Amazon's credit card and business loans are aimed at boosting its e-commerce business, while Uber Money is providing credit cards, debit accounts and money tracking tools to serve the company's taxi operations.Facebook has said its Facebook Pay service will complement its messaging tools.And both Google and Apple, which has teamed up with Goldman Sachs' new consumer arm, Marcus, on a credit card as part of its Apple Pay and Wallet service, want to to make iPhones and Androids essential.Wading into financial services will also provide Google and Facebook information for their advertising business, helping to track what ads lead to purchases, Mr du Toit said.The moves into banking are likely to add to the debates over the tech giants, which are already facing probes related to competition, data protection and privacy.Some officials have also expressed worry about gaps in financial oversight as growing activity occurs outside of traditional banking. And in recent days, New York announced it would investigate Apple, after accusations that its credit card relied on ""sexist"" algorithms.Mr du Toit said regulatory concerns represent the ""fly in the soup"" for tech firms.""They will have to be very careful,"" he said.In many cases, the tech firms are working with traditional banks - a sign they are aware of the potential issues, he said.Google said its US partners, which reportedly include Citigroup, would start to offer the accounts by 2020.""We believe our partners' regulatory and financial know-how is a great complement to our experience in building helpful tools and technology for our users,"" it said in a statement.Amazon has offered small business loans since 2011 and launched its credit card with JP Morgan Chase in 2017.But in some ways, the flurry of announcements by companies this year, is a sign that the US is late to the party.In China and some other countries, the tech firms moved quickly into banking, motivated by the need to fill the gaps left by traditional finance industry that created hurdles for their businesses, whether they were e-commerce firms or food delivery companies.In the US, however, the need was less pressing, thanks in part to the ubiquity of credit cards and other ""good enough solutions"", Mr du Toit said.Big tech payment services provided by the likes of Alibaba's Ant Financial and Tencent's WeChat account for roughly 16% of China's GDP, compared to less than 1% in the US, according to the Bank for International Settlements, an organisation backed by 60 of the world's central banks.Tech companies ""are now increasingly getting into it because they do believe they can offer a materially better solution to customers,"" he said.Last month, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg evoked the threat of Chinese competition while defending his firm's interest in developing a cryptocurrency before Congress last month.""I view the financial infrastructure in the US as outdated,"" he said.As the tech companies start to make use of their massive reach, close customer relationships and giant data sets, banks ""have woken up"" to the threat, leading to collaborations and other uneasy ""frenemy"" arrangements, Mr du Toit said.With tech firms moving beyond credit cards, regional banks will get left behind, while smaller financial technology firms are forced out or acquired, Mr du Toit said.""I sometimes describe this as a giant Darwinian experiment of different couplings of the banks and the big techs,"" he says. ""There will be some mutations that succeed and others that fail.""While Google's earlier efforts to build up Google Pay failed to gain much traction in the US, the firm has developed significant payment business in India, where a Bain & Co survey found that more than half of respondents had used the platform in the last 12 months.""I would not count them out,"" Mr du Toit said."

business	Victoria's Secret cancels fashion show amid ratings drop		"Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has cancelled its annual fashion show amid dwindling television ratings and rising criticism of the event.The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year.Last year it had its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity.The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to ""evolve"" its marketing strategy.""We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers,"" Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands chief financial officer, told investors on an earnings call.Nevertheless, he said the shows were ""an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement"".The annual show featured some of the world's top supermodels, often wearing elaborate outfits.The show was a milestone in the career of many supermodels including Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Miranda Kerr.Changing attitudes appear to have hit sales and the brand's bottom line.Poor sales at Victoria's Secret weighed on the performance of L Brands, which reported a net loss of $252m (£195.1m) in third quarter results announced this week.The underwear brand has also faced a number of recent controversies.Last year, there was a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then-chief marketing officer Ed Razek who suggested ""transsexual"" models should not be part of the event.He later apologised for the comments and left the company earlier this year.L Brands also received bad publicity due to billionaire founder Les Wexner's friendship with the late US financier Jeffrey Epstein.Epstein died in prison in August while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.Mr Wexner employed Epstein as an adviser, but cut ties in 2007, and has previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money."
business	Provident Financial gets £1.3bn bid from rival NSF	Fines and sanctions	"Sub-prime lender Non-Standard Finance (NSF) has made a £1.3bn takeover offer for rival Provident Financial.NSF boss John van Kuffeler was previously chief executive and chairman of Provident, a doorstep lender with a history of financial troubles.He said the deal would ""create a market leader in non-standard finance"".NSF said the takeover was backed by more than 50% of Provident's shareholders, including fund manager Neil Woodford, Invesco and Marathon.Investors must still vote on whether to approve the deal.Provident has seen its shares plunge after profit warnings and the resignation of a former chief executive.In January, it warned again that profits would be below analysts' expectations. The group said it had seen a rise in bad debts at its Vanquis Bank arm and falling numbers of new accounts after clamping down on its lending.Under the terms of the offer, Provident shareholders would get 8.88 new NSF shares for each Provident share.Based on NSF's closing share price of 58p on Thursday, the tie-up values Provident at £1.3bn, or 511p per share.It is the second time NSF has approached Provident.Mr van Kuffeler said: ""We have recognised the strong logic and value creation potential of a combination with Provident for some time and hence approached the Provident board with a proposal in January last year. That approach was rebuffed and since then Provident has further lost its way.""However, NSF has extensive management expertise and experience, and the correct strategy to turn Provident around and release significant value by combining it with our own fast-growing businesses for the benefit of customers, employees and investors.""Provident is also recovering from a string of regulatory sanctions.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Vanquis £2m and ordered it to pay £168.8m in compensation for failing to disclose charges of its popular repayment option plan.Meanwhile, its Moneybarn car loan arm is under investigation by the FCA over how it treats borrowers who fall behind with payments."
business	Hong Kong: 'I was tear gassed getting my lunch'	Panic button'Pro-protester or pro-police'Losing business to Singapore	"""I've been tear gassed a few times, but never when I was outside my office - popping out to get my lunch,"" says one trader at HSBC.He is describing the moment this week when Hong Kong's protests came to the central financial district , one of the world's biggest commercial hubs.He says it was a watershed moment, that's made him and many of his peers question their future in the city.Speaking to the BBC under condition of anonymity, directors at some of the biggest international banks and law firms said they are seeing their business in Hong Kong shrink as the protests continue to escalate.Financial services make up a fifth of Hong Kong's economy and people come from all over the world to live and work here. Its large expatriate community is attracted by the low taxes, well-paid jobs, stability and high standards of living.However, the lure of prosperity and stability in the East Asian hub has been undermined substantially since Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests, backing increased democracy and opposing the actions of the police.This last week where violence has intensified has made many firms reconsider the safety of their staff in the city.One hedge fund manager has even been given a panic button app in case of an emergency and plans are in place with his work to evacuate him and his family to another major city ""if we were in danger they have a team of people who would get us out"".A banker at HSBC says only half of their staff came in to the office on Friday as people are encouraged to work remotely if they can't get in safely.Staff are kept closely informed about the situation on the ground according to a BNP Paribas employee ""We get regular emails early in the morning and through the day from the business continuity management team - telling us whether it's safe to go into offices - and whether we should go home early.""Anecdotally, the political pressure from the Chinese government on banks and law firms is also growing - and it's putting pressure on staff.Some partners in law firms are being asked to pin their colours to the mast and state whether they support the protesters or the Chinese government before winning business from Chinese firms.Firms are under pressure to keep a lid on their staff speaking in public about their views.One lawyer explains ""I've been on calls where people are asked to verbally communicate restraint and caution when sharing their views. Given the amount of people we employ here, it's a minor miracle nothing has happened"".In the workplace, people are making informal rules not to discuss the subject within their teams because emotions are running so high.""Clearly it's the only topic of conversation in the office, but opinions are so split,"" one banker says.""In my team of nine, three are Chinese and two are Hong Kong Chinese and the rest are expats - it's a bit like Brexit - we all have violently different views.""A video on social media of a man who claims to work at Citigroup being arrested by police has been widely shared in the banking community.""This has scared people here - it makes you feel we could all get caught up in this""A spokesperson for the US-headquartered banking group said: ""We are investigating this incident and while investigations continue it would be inappropriate to comment further"".One of the biggest concerns for financial firms is the impact all of this is having on the economy as its reputation for stability unravels.A source at one of the world's biggest international banks says it expects its Hong Kong revenue to be down by 25% in the last quarter of their financial year as a result of the violence.Many banks are now reviewing their investment plans in Hong Kong over the next few years ""If we're still talking about this in six months time, people will start giving up on Hong Kong""They are concerned that people who are planning major deals will now turn to banks and law firms in Singapore because, in the words of one, ""it has a more predictable medium-term outlook"".So far most of the business impact has been on small companies - restaurants for example. There is concern amongst bankers, borne out in recent economic statistics, that this could spread more widely.""The classic company we deal with would be lending money to a Chinese shipping company that does its financial transactions through HK. They rely on a healthy business environment in Hong Kong. Now we worry they will go bankrupt""."
business	Saudi Aramco flotation values oil giant at $1.7tn	Analysis: Katie Prescott, BBC business correspondent	"Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on state oil company Aramco of between $1.6tn (£1.22tn) and $1.7tn.The company has published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO), seeking more than $25bn for the sale of 1.5% of its shares.That would make it potentially the world's biggest IPO, coming from the world's most profitable companyIt is short of the $2tn valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly keen to achieve.""The base offer size will be 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares,"" the state-owned energy giant said in a statement that set the price range at 30-32 Saudi riyals per share ($8-$8.5).That could value the IPO at as much as 96bn riyals ($25.60bn) at the top end of the range.If priced at the top end, the deal could just beat the record-breaking $25bn raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.Individual retail investors, as well as big institutions, will have a chance to buy shares.Aramco had initially been expected to sell some 5% of its shares on two exchanges, with a first listing of 2% on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another 3% on an overseas exchange.The firm says there are now no current plans for an international sale, with that long-discussed goal now seemingly being put on ice.Aramco called off a number of so-called roadshows for the shares, aimed at enticing foreign buyers, the Financial Times reported.European meetings were cancelled on Monday after similar pitches in Asia and the US were dropped at the weekend, the newspaper said.The crown prince is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.Analysts S&P Global Ratings said the stock market debut could enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen its financial position.""If subsequently effectively deployed, the funds raised could be used to support longer-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia,"" it said.In its prospectus released last week, the company lists a variety of investment risks ranging from terrorist attacks to geopolitical tensions in a region dominated by Saudi-Iran rivalry.The 600-page prospectus also includes the government's control over oil output as another potential risk.After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice.Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest.The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn.A third of Aramco's shares - about $8bn worth - will be sold to the man and (the prospectus says) even the divorced woman on the street, giving local Saudi Arabians a stake in their nation's cash cow for the first time.A TV and billboard advertising campaign, as well as social media, is stoking enthusiasm on the ground and demand is expected to be high. For the remaining $16bn, the oil giant is turning to institutional investors.And a source close to the company says there has been sufficient interest that they're confident they can cover most of this off within the Gulf. But there will be disappointment amongst officials if global demand is not there for the jewel in Saudi Arabia's crown.A fossil fuels company owned by an absolute monarchy in a volatile region are not an easy sell for many Western firms, pursuing the latest trend in investment policy of ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria.Norway's sovereign wealth fund is among those to already rule themselves out from investing.But the promise of sharing the promised annual $75bn cash dividend pot might be too good for some to miss, according to James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management (one of the UK's largest charity fund managers).Given his firm's focus, he is not looking to invest in the shares but explains why some are. ""It's a 'risk' in the eyes of some investors to be very underweight in oil and gas, and Aramco may be a means of plugging a sector gap with perhaps less worry than associated with holding Gazprom,"" he says.Investors follow indexes - such as the FTSE 100 - which are made up of array of types of industries and so some feel oil and gas needs to be correspondingly represented in their portfolio.As Aramco's big sales pitch road show kicks off, the real test of investor appetite for the company will begin."
business	Car sales see biggest fall since financial crisis	'Confidence problem'Analysis:Theo Leggett, BBC Business Correspondent	"UK car sales last year saw the biggest annual fall since the financial crisis, according to the industry trade body.The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 2.36 million new cars were registered in 2018 down 6.8% on the previous year, the biggest drop since an 11% fall in 2008.Diesel sales sank by 30% on worries over possible tougher restrictions.However, the move away from diesel cars contributed to a 3% rise in the average emissions of CO2 by new cars last year.Diesel cars typically produce less CO2 than petrol vehicles.A customer switch towards bigger cars, in particular SUVs, also contributed to greater average CO2 emissions.While diesel cars produce less CO2 than petrol cars, they produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides or NOx, which are associated with breathing difficulties.The SMMT blamed last year's fall in cars sales - the second consecutive year that the market has declined - on uncertainty over Brexit and a shortage in supply of some vehicles due to a new emissions testing scheme.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes described those challenges as ""something of perfect storm"" for the industry.""What we have been seeing over the last couple of years is a decline in business and consumer confidence, especially the confidence to buy big ticket items like a new car,"" he said.With sales of almost 96,000 the Ford Fiesta was the best selling car in the UK last year, the SMMT said.The Volkswagen Golf was next, with sales of almost 65,000.The boss of the SMMT says the industry has been facing a ""perfect storm"" - but the real typhoon may lie ahead.So far the decline in car sales has been largely due to a fairly catastrophic fall in demand for diesels.Put simply, the public perception is that diesel engines are dirty - leading headline-hungry politicians to talk up the prospect of bans and other restrictions.And who will buy a car if they think they won't be allowed to use it?The industry insists modern diesels are cleaner than their predecessors - but persuading policymakers to support a diesel sales drive currently looks like an uphill struggle.However, the real storm could erupt on 29 March. The SMMT says a no deal Brexit would be a ""disaster"" for the industry - because manufacturers need parts to be where they are needed, exactly when they are needed.New border controls and formalities would make those operations ""virtually impossible"".Despite the dramatic decline in sales of diesel cars, Mr Hawes thinks those types of cars have a future.""For many consumers diesel is still the right choice. It offers better fuel economy and generally about 20% improvement on CO2 emissions.""There are no specific bans on diesel and the newer diesels are actually exempt from any of the additional restrictions that are being put in place,"" he told the BBC.Analyst Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said the figures were no surprise, as it had been known for months that sales were falling.""It's not time to panic and worth remembering that in absolute terms, sales are still way ahead of the nadir we hit at the start of the decade. Manufacturers and retailers are making positive steps to try to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape, in particular through the development of new alternatively fuelled models.""But they can't do it all on their own - they need support from the government to encourage more new vehicle purchases and allow the industry to thrive this year,"" he said."
business	Carlos Ghosn: Former Nissan chair charged with financial misconduct	'Deepest regret'AnalysisRupert Wingfield-Hayes, Japan CorrespondentWho is Carlos Ghosn?Carmaker alliance	"Japanese prosecutors have charged former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn with financial misconduct, accusing him of under-reporting his pay package over a five-year period.He has also been re-arrested on further allegations of under-stating his pay, which is likely to keep him in detention until 30 December.Mr Ghosn has previously denied the accusations.Prosecutors have also charged Nissan in relation to the case.Mr Ghosn was arrested in November after the allegations first surfaced. Monday was the last day he could be held by authorities before he either had to be charged or released.His defence team say the accusations against Mr Ghosn are invalid because they do not relate to his salary, but to future payments that he was expected to receive after retirement.Nissan said it was taking the situation ""extremely seriously"".""Making false disclosures in annual securities reports greatly harms the integrity of Nissan's public disclosures in the securities markets, and the company expresses its deepest regret,"" the carmaker said in a statement.A source close to the firm said that the charges were not unexpected ""given the company flagged its concerns"" to prosecutors after it had conducted an internal investigation.The new charges against Carlos Ghosn will allow prosecutors to continue detaining him until 30 December.His interrogations will continue and can be done without Mr Ghosn having his lawyer present.In Japan there is nothing surprising about this. But elsewhere there has been real shock at the draconian nature of Japan's justice system.American attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz today likened Japan's system to that of authoritarian regimes like Iran, Cuba and even China.Secondly Carlos Ghosn has been effectively accused of the same offence twice.The new arrest warrant accuses him of under-reporting his pay for a further three years (2016-18).A former prosecutor, I have spoken to, says this suggests the Tokyo prosecutors have no other evidence of wrongdoing against Mr Ghosn.If that is the case, the former prosecutor told me, the case against Mr Ghosn is very weak.But he says, because it is such a high-profile case, they will feel compelled to press charges and take the case to its conclusion.If Mr Ghosn is convicted, the charges could mean up to 10 years in prison. The charges also carry a fine of up to 700m yen ($6.2m; £4.9m), according to the Japanese regulator, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.Originally, prosecutors said that Mr Ghosn and senior executive Greg Kelly - who has also been charged with financial misconduct - had conspired to understate Mr Ghosn's pay from 2011 to 2015. The fresh charges, issued on Monday, allege they did the same thing from 2016 to 2018.From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen ($888,000; £697,000).Carlos Ghosn profile: The driven ""cost killer""Brazil-born Mr Ghosn, aged 64, known as the Le Cost Killer for his radical approach to restructuring, was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. In the past, he has been hailed a hero in Japan for turning around the ailing Nissan.French car maker Renault was seen as the dominant partner due to its 43% shareholding in Nissan, despite selling fewer vehicles. Nissan's shareholding in Renault is only 15%.Sources close to Mr Ghosn have previously described the accusations as a ""clinically planned hatchet job"", arguing they were aimed at resetting the balance of power in the carmakers' alliance.While the governments of Japan and France insisted that the alliance of companies that manufactured 10 million cars last year should be preserved, it is widely thought that Nissan executives were uncomfortable at the power wielded over the company by Renault and concentrated in the hands of Mr Ghosn.Nissan and Mitsubishi both sacked Mr Ghosn as chairman after the arrest last month.But Renault has held off doing so, saying he would remain as its chairman and chief executive, but has appointed a temporary deputy chief executive to take over the running of the firm."
business	Carlos Ghosn accuses Japan of unlawful conspiracy	How did we get here?	"Carlos Ghosn's lawyers have accused the Japanese government of conspiring against him, along with prosecutors and Nissan executives.Mr Ghosn, who was arrested last year over claims of financial misconduct, faces several charges in Japan.His lawyers say the Tokyo court should drop all charges against him because of ""unlawful breaches"" by prosecutors.Mr Ghosn, formerly a towering figure in the carmaking world, is out on bail awaiting trial.Mr Ghosn's lawyers said in a statement that the prosecutors' case was ""politically motivated"" and laid out some of the ""illegal actions"" they say were committed by the prosecutors.""The prosecution against him resulted from unlawful collusion between the prosecutors, government officials at METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and executives at Nissan, who formed a secret task force to drum up allegations of wrongdoing,"" the lawyers said, according to the statement.They said the aim was to oust Mr Ghosn from his position as head of the Renault-Nissan alliance to prevent him from integrating the two companies ""which would have threatened the autonomy of one of the jewels of Japanese industry under the French flag"".Mr Ghosn is credited with having turned around the fortunes of both Nissan and Renault over several years.Nissan declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.Carlos Ghosn's lawyers certainly aren't holding back. The man himself has already accused ""backstabbing"" executives at Nissan of conspiring with prosecutors to bring about his downfall.But now they've gone even further, implicating government officials in a grand conspiracy, designed to avoid a Ghosn-led merger between Nissan and Renault and prevent a Japanese industrial champion from coming under a French flag.It's a move which seems designed to cause maximum embarrassment in Japan, to present Mr Ghosn as the innocent foreign victim of a nationalist stitch-up - and effectively put the Japanese judicial system on trial.It makes the charges themselves - which are all denied - seem almost irrelevant. But that may well be the general idea.The 65-year-old was first arrested in November 2018 and spent 108 days in custody. He faces charges over allegations of financial misconduct and breach of trust.Mr Ghosn, who was first released in March after posting bail, has repeatedly said he is innocent.He has previously also accused former Nissan executives of ""backstabbing"".The fall from grace of the industry titan has attracted global attention.The case has also highlighted infighting within the carmaker alliance and focused scrutiny on Japan's legal system."
business	Hopes rise of UK-EU financial service deal	Analysis'Greater certainty'	"The UK has struck a deal with the EU on post-Brexit financial services, according to unconfirmed reports.The Times newspaper said London had agreed in talks with Brussels to give UK financial services firms continued access to the bloc. The pound has risen 1% against the dollar in response.But a government source said that was ""a rather rose-tinted interpretation of where we have got to"".The source told the BBC: ""People shouldn't get ahead of themselves.""The Times said in its report that an initial deal on exchange of data had also been agreed.It added the deal was expected to be completed within three weeks.Sterling rose on hopes of an agreement, with the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar at $1.2887.Britain's departure from the European Union is expected to take place in March next year, but many UK-based businesses have expressed concern over the lack of progress in Brexit talks.Despite various reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May that definite trade terms between firms in the UK and the EU will be finalised by March next year, businesses across the board are already preparing for the worst.Mrs May's senior adviser on Europe, Oliver Robbins, was continuing the negotiations in Brussels, The Times said.Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenterEquivalence - the apparent basis of Theresa May's reported deal with Brussels on financial services - sounds like a cuddly continuation of what the City has now. It is not.In this context, equivalence is a legal term describing the regime the EU uses when dealing with countries outside its boundaries. The EU grants equivalence to other states if it can be persuaded that its rules are the same as the ones set by Brussels.Equivalence, and the trading rights that come with it, can be withdrawn at any time. That is why when one of the big City law firms, Hogan Lovells, was asked to look at equivalence by the City UK, the trade body for the Square Mile, its conclusion was that it did not ""provide a long-term sustainable solution"".What we do not know, however, is whether Mrs May has managed to negotiate some kind of ""equivalence-plus"", with the kind of safeguards that would ease City fears. In any event, reports of any kind of deal were enough to rally sterling, and even those unhappy with the idea of equivalence would concede that it is probably better than no deal at all.According to the newspaper's report, the deal means that after Brexit, UK financial services companies will be able to operate within the EU as they do now.The Times said the EU would accept that the UK had ""equivalent"" regulations to Brussels and would therefore be allowed market access.However, there has been no official confirmation of the report.Thomas Moore, investment director of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the BBC's Today programme that if true, ""I think on balance, it's positive.""He said the granting of equivalence, much desired by the City, ""produces much greater certainty, not just for financial companies""."

business	Financial Times boss returns £510,000 rise	'Widespread anger'	"The boss of the Financial Times will hand back a pay rise of more than £500,000 after some of the newspaper's journalists complained about his pay.Explaining his decision, John Ridding said the rise had ""created concerns"".This month, Steve Bird, of the paper's National Union of Journalists chapel, wrote to FT staff saying Mr Ridding's £2.6m pay was absurdly high.And the NUJ urged him to go further and increase pay for all staff, claiming reporters' pay had been ""squeezed"".In an email to staff, Mr Ridding said his salary was set by the FT's Japanese owners Nikkei, and was independently assessed and ""highly performance-related"".However, he added: ""While our performance has been strong, I recognise that the size of the consequent jump in my own total reward in 2017 feels anomalous and has created concerns.""For now, I have decided to reinvest into the FT the increase awarded in 2017, which is £510,000 before tax.""He said ""the first call"" on the money would be a women's development fund to boost the FT's efforts to promote women to more senior roles and reduce the gender pay gap.""The balance of funds will be used to help meet the company's overall financial objectives,"" he added.The NUJ welcomed his decision, but called on Mr Ridding to award ""above-inflation pay increases"" to staff both inside and outside editorial.It also said he should forego his bonus this year and called on the board to reveal how much every director is paid.""We believe the company should respond to the widespread anger among staff as a matter of urgency,"" it said.""If we do not receive a timely response to all of our demands, we instruct chapel reps to place this matter into dispute and take such steps as may be necessary, up to and including balloting for industrial action.""Nikkei, which bought the FT from Pearson for $1.3bn (£1.02bn) in 2016, said it was very satisfied with the growth of the newspaper under Mr Ridding.""We respect and support his proposal to adjust his remuneration to refocus attention on the FT's mission,"" Nikkei said.The FT chief was paid about £1.6m in the year before the sale to Nikkei.Mr Ridding's decision comes after UK chief executives' pay rose by 11% last year.A Chartered Institute of Personnel Development survey found that median pay for bosses of the UK's biggest companies hit almost £4m last year - up from about £3.5m in 2016."
business	Hong Kong protests hit Burberry and Cathay Pacific	Protecting staff	"Two companies with major operations in Hong Kong have revealed the financial impact of violent protests in the City.Luxury fashion house Burberry said Hong Kong sales had fallen sharply and would ""remain under pressure"".Airline Cathay Pacific said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".The anti-government protests have gripped Hong Kong for five months and rattled stock markets.Burberry said it had seen a ""double digit"" percentage decline in sales in Hong Kong - where it has 10 shops and usually generates about 8% of its sales.However, its share of sales from Hong Kong fell to 5% in the latest quarter and chief financial officer Julie Brown said the group had been forced to close some stores to keep staff safe, although none had been damaged.The retailer said it had written down the value of its stores in Hong Kong by £14m.Despite this, total sales across the Burberry group rose 5% in the six months to 28 September. Marco Gobbetti, Burberry's chief executive, said the results were in line with the guidance earlier in the year despite the disruption in Hong Kong, and the retailer's shares climbed 5% in response.Mr Gobbetti has been taking Burberry further upmarket since he took the helm two years ago and said the new collection from its chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci was generating ""strong double digit growth"".Cathay Pacific - which is majority-owned by the Swire investment company, while Air China has a 30% stake - said the short-term outlook remained ""challenging and uncertain"".The Hong Kong flag carrier lowered its profit guidance for the second time in less than a month.The ""forward bookings outlook remains weak and uncertain"", the airline said, with passenger traffic dipping ""significantly"", particularly for inbound flights from mainland China.The airline changed its top management in August when its then chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit after the airline became embroiled in a controversy over the Hong Kong protests.Cathay Pacific had initially told its staff it would not stop them joining the pro-democracy demonstrations, but days later Mr Hogg warned staff they could be fired if they ""support or participate in illegal protests"".In Thursday's results presentation, the airline said inbound passenger traffic was down 38% in August and September, and 35% in October. It added it was reducing its fight capacity by 6% to 7% in the coming months.The carrier is also deferring the delivery of four Airbus SE narrow body planes in 2020 as a result of the downturn in demand.Luya You, an analyst at broking group Bocom International who attended Cathay's analyst briefing, told Reuters that the management ""didn't rule out more extreme measures - grounding aircraft, severing leases, cancelling orders - if the situation in Hong Kong deteriorates or extends significantly beyond expectations"".All schools were closed on Thursday in Hong Kong as the territory faced another day of escalating unrest.The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."
business	MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes	'Hollow words''Investing billions'	"MPs have condemned the level of IT failures at banks, warning that financial levies on firms and more regulation may be needed.A Treasury Committee report said the frequency of online banking crashes and customer disruption was ""unacceptable"".The report, published on Monday, said with bank branches and cash machines closing, there was greater urgency to ensure online banking worked.Major banks typically suffer more than 10 online outages a month.Customers are being left ""cashless and cut off"", the report said. Firms could do much more to ensure their IT systems were resilient and to resolve complaints and compensation more quickly.The MPs suggest the three major regulators - Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Authority, Bank of England - do not have the staff and experience to deal with the growing number of computer failures.An increase in the financial levies on banks may be needed to ensure that the regulators are adequately funded and resourced , the report says.MPs are also worried about the increase use of third-party providers of cloud services for computing power and data storage.""The consequences of a major operational incident at a large cloud service provider, such as Microsoft, Google or Amazon, could be significant,"" the report said. ""There is, therefore, a considerable case for the regulation of these cloud service providers to ensure high standards of operational resilience.""Cloud services ""stood out as such a source of systemic risk"" for the financial system, the MPs said.Steve Baker, the Treasury Committee's lead member on the inquiry, said: ""The number of IT failures that have occurred in the financial services sector, including TSB, Visa and Barclays, and the harm caused to consumers is unacceptable.""The committee, therefore, launched this inquiry to look 'under the bonnet' at what's causing the proliferation of such incidents, and what the regulators can do to prevent and mitigate their impacts.""Mr Baker added: ""For too long, financial institutions issue hollow words after their systems have failed, which is of no help to customers left cashless and cut off.""The MPs also said there is a ""concerning"" lack of consistent and accurate recording of data on IT incidents.If future incidents occur without sanction, Parliament should consider whether the regulators' enforcement powers are fit for purpose, the report said.TSB suffered a high-profile IT failure last year which left customers unable to access their accounts, following the introduction of a new system.Up to 1.9 million people lost access to online banking services.The MPs said regulators must provide them with the outcome of their investigation into the TSB IT failure as soon as possible.Mr Baker said: ""For too long, we have waited for a comprehensive account of what happened during the TSB IT failure. Our inquiry into service disruption at TSB remains open.""Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body for the financial services sector, said the industry was investing billions of pounds to ensure its systems are robust and secure.""When incidents do occur, firms work around the clock to minimise disruption and get services back up and running as quickly as possible,"" he said.""The industry conducts sector-wide exercises with regulators to ensure it is prepared to respond effectively to any major disruptions or events as part of its continued commitment to maintaining the resilience of the financial system.""He said UK Finance is working to improve co-ordination with regulators, but it was important to ""avoid overlapped or rushed mandatory change programmes that impact firms' ability to protect their customers""."
business	Wetherspoon's lambasted for Brexit beermat campaign	Influencing voters	"Investors in UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon are being urged to reject the firm's annual report over its failure to clear pro-Brexit spending.The call comes from influential shareholder group Pirc, which says the promotion broke company law.It comes after Wetherspoon's spent nearly £95,000 on pro-Leave beermats, posters and booklets during the 2016 referendum campaign.Pirc said such political expenditure required shareholders' backing.Wetherspoon's chairman and founder, Tim Martin, is an outspoken supporter of Brexit and has even staged a nationwide tour to argue the case for the UK's departure from the EU.Mr Martin owns 32% of the pub chain, with the rest mainly held by institutional investors.Pirc quoted legal experts as saying Wetherspoon's could be in breach of the Companies Act because of its financial support for Brexit.It called on shareholders to oppose the firm's financial statements at its next annual general meeting on 21 November.The move would be largely symbolic but would put pressure on the company's board.The pub chain said it had honoured its responsibilities by declaring its spending to the Electoral Commission. ""We complied with this requirement,"" said Mr Martin.But Pirc said: ""Companies are also meant to declare annual political spending above £2,000 in their annual report, which JD Wetherspoon did not do.""It also quoted legal experts as saying that shareholder approval was necessary for activities ""capable of being reasonably regarded as intended to influence voters in relation to any national or regional referendum"".Wetherspoon's disputes that interpretation, saying the law did not require it to seek investors' backing.This is not the first time that Pirc, which describes itself as ""the UK's leading independent research and advisory consultancy"", has attempted to intervene in Wetherspoon's AGMs.Last year, it recommended that Mr Martin should not be re-elected as chairman, but the attempt to oust him failed.After Mr Martin, the biggest shareholder in Wetherspoon's is Threadneedle Asset Management, which holds just under 16%.The BBC has approached Threadneedle for a comment."
business	Hammond: 'Shock' of financial crisis still with us	Brexit disruptionDebt burden	"The ""shock"" of the financial crisis continues to impact the economy and peoples' finances, UK chancellor Philip Hammond has said.Ten years after the financial system went into meltdown, he admitted ""people are still suffering the effects"".But he said, in an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed, there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"".Rising wages and falling inflation were good news, he said, but uncertainty about Brexit was an economic dampener.A decade ago this week, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, sending shockwaves through the global financial system.Research carried out for the BBC to mark the occasion showed that wages remain substantially below what they would have been with the crisis.Mr Hammond told the BBC: ""We suffered a very big shock to our economy in 2008/09, and that's a shock from which people are still suffering the effects today.""He was ""acutely conscious"" of the impact on wage stagnation and living. But he added: ""We have got through this in much better shape than many of our neighbours.""We haven't suffered catastrophic rises of unemployment, on the contrary, we've seen employment grow by three million jobs over this period.""We didn't see widespread repossessions of homes, collapses of businesses, in the way we've done in previous recessions, so I think the way this has been managed has minimised the impact.""Independent analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility projected real wage growth over the coming years, he added.Mr Hammond also defended government efforts to cut debt, which many people argue led to austerity and worsened the impact on people's incomes and the economy.""In the aftermath of the crisis, the urgent need was to reassure markets and investors about our intentions,"" Mr Hammond said. ""Government borrowing had grown to unprecedented levels - almost 10% of our total national income in the year after the crash - and the markets needed to know that we were going to be able to get that under control.""He had, in fact, relaxed fiscal rules when becoming chancellor in 2016, Mr Hammond pointed out. That gave ""more headroom"" he said.But the challenge the economy faces ""is not lack of demand, it's poor productivity. It we want to see sustainable rises in living standards and real wages, we have to address the productivity challenge,"" he said.An impediment to stronger economic growth was uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations to leave the European Union, the chancellor said.Brexit talks were currently ""acting as a dampener on the economy"".""The potential of a no-deal exit with high disruption as a consequence is clearly a risk to the financial system.""He repeated warnings about the impact on London's huge financial services sector from a non-deal Brexit. ""If that market is disrupted then there could be significant consequences.""Mr Hammond said he understood the calls for more spending on, say, the NHS and police. ""We've made a huge commitment to the NHS, committing to spending £24bn across the UK by the end of this five-year period,"" he told the BBC.But he added: ""We do have to get our debt down. We have to do that for two reasons: Firstly the cost of our debt, is crippling - £50bn a year of money that we could be spending on schools and hospitals and police forces, being paid out in interest on the debt.""Secondly, having a debt that is this high, 85% of our GDP, reduces our ability to respond to another shock to the economy, another recession."""
business	How did the financial crisis affect your finances?	1. Homes2. Savings3. Borrowing4. Banking	"Ten years after the financial crisis, and the shockwaves are still being felt on people's finances.Personal debt levels are at record highs and our banks are fast disappearing from the high street.Low interest rate have left savers enduring a decade of paltry returns, but it's never been cheaper for mortgage borrowers.In the changed financial environment, the question to ask is: ""Are my finances fit for the next decade?""Here, we examine four personal finances areas - homes, savings, borrowing and banking - to discover the lasting legacy of the financial crisis.The average UK house price fell from a pre-crisis peak of £190,032 in September 2007 to a low of £154,452 in March 2009, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Land Registry. Since then, the price of an average house has recovered to £228,384.Is that good news for homeowners? Not necessarily. There's no such thing as an average house, and for homeowners there's been a real north-south divide in the last decade in terms of property prices.Londoners and those in the south-east have seen prices soar, but elsewhere in the country, the picture is much different.Richard Donnell, insight director at Hometrack, said: ""Although a decade has passed since the crash, house prices have still not recovered back to the levels seen in 2008 in many markets across Britain.""Northern Ireland and parts of northern England, Scotland and Wales are the areas most affected. House prices continued to fall in the markets most affected for up to four years after 2008 as demand for housing was impacted by tighter credit availability and weak economic growth.""In the capital, house prices started to bounce back strongly in 2010 on rising employment and increasing numbers of overseas investors, he said. It means the whole of the London housing market has house prices that are more than 50% higher than 2008 levels.What will happen next? Experts reckon prices will continue to rise but by less than in the last decade, and much less so in London.The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted property price growth will fall to 2.4% by the end of 2019, while estate agents Strutt & Parker have predicted a 2.5% rise a year over the next two years.Meanwhile, accountants PWC have forecast that average UK house prices will rise by 4% a year until 2025.For Britain's savers, the last decade has been a disaster, especially those that had enjoyed decent returns in the years before.In fact. £1,000 tucked away in a savings account a decade before the crash would have yielded a healthy £652 in interest. But anyone who stashed £1,000 in an account in the last ten years would have earned interest of just £149.That's because in September 2008, the average deposit account paid interest of 3.1%, according to Bank of England data. That now stands at 0.43%.Ten years ago you could get 5% on instant access savings, more than 6% on a one-year bond and 7% on a five-year bond from well-known established high street names.Now the best rates are nowhere near as generous, with just 1.35% offered on instant access, 2.05% for one year and 2.70% for five years.According to James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru, around 30 new banks and 40 new providers have entered the savings market since the crash. ""The best interest rates almost entirely come from these new providers,"" he said.Yet the traditional big financial institutions still hold around 85% of savings in the UK, with many savers' loyalty repaid by getting little or no interest on their nest-eggs.Hargreaves Lansdown analysis suggests there has been a huge rise in the amount of money held in accounts paying no interest in the last decade, from £48bn in September 2008 to £164bn today.""While the value of the savings market has continued to grow around 5% a year to more than £1.5tn, the new entrants have taken much of the growth in the market, rather than make significant progress against the big players,"" said Mr Blower.But things could improve soon, predicted Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.""At this point, savers have reason to be marginally more optimistic about the future,"" she said. ""That's because the regulator is looking more closely at how the industry functions, in an effort to protect savers from the lowest rates.""Average household debt has climbed from less than £3,000 to £4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit that is available through plastic cards.Credit card companies have been competing to offer ever-longer interest-free periods to attract customers.In 2008 the longest 0% balance transfer was 15 months. Today, it is 36 months, although at one stage it reached a record high of 43 months.Analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms,co.uk, said: ""I'm not sure this is a good thing for all. Some savvy customers have moved balances around and paid little or no interest but others have struggled to repay their debt when their 0% deal ended - so are now being charged 20% APR or more.""He said it was one reason why personal debt levels have risen. ""It's been easy and cheap money a-plenty over the last decade but paying it back will prove to be a long and costly struggle for some.""Overdrafts have also changed in the last decade. Most banks have changed the way they charge, moving from charging by a traditional interest rates to either daily or monthly fees.""Providers have proclaimed that daily fees are easier to understand,"" said Mr Hagger. ""That may be true, but at the same time they are also much more expensive for customers and a big profit driver.""The simple truth is that the way to reduce debt is to pay it off as quickly as you can and ignore the temptation of easy credit. With interest rates on the rise, what seems manageable debt now can quickly spiral into problems.There's a completely different banking landscape from 10 years ago, not least because traditional players have been busy closing branches.But at the same time the crisis marked the beginning of the entry of a whole new range of challenger banks.Back in 2008, the most likely challengers looked set to be the supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Now the biggest challenge to traditional banking comes from branch-free app banks, such as Starling or Monzo.Julian Skan, senior managing director in banking at Accenture Strategy, said: ""Wider competition is now coming from platform players, which didn't exist ten years ago, and who have greater opportunities to bite at banking revenues.""But he warned that computer attacks are likely to increase in the years ahead, bringing a fresh challenge. ""Resiliency in the face of growing cyber risks is the new threat,"" Mr Skan said.But there also needs a change in outlook, according to Bevis Watts, managing director of ethical challenger Triodos Bank UK.He said: ""The pace of change has been far too slow and more needs to be done to re-purpose banking for good, through greater transparency on how money is used, carbon disclosure, impact reporting and using risk capital weightings to account for environmental and societal risks.""In other words, banks need to respond to the changing demands from customers in the next decade."
business	Apple's 'sexist' credit card investigated by US regulator	'Legal violation'Analysis	"A US financial regulator has opened an investigation into claims Apple's credit card offered different credit limits for men and women.It follows complaints - including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak - that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased against women.New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card.Any discrimination, intentional or not, ""violates New York law"", the DFS said.The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday that tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got.In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score.Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets.The same thing happened to us. We have no separate bank accounts or credit cards or assets of any kind. We both have the same high limits on our cards, including our AmEx Centurion card. But 10x on the Apple Card.End of Twitter post by @stevewozBanks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications.But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate.US healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group is being investigated over claims an algorithm favoured white patients over black patients.Mr Hansson said in a tweet: ""Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they've placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate.""He said that as soon as he raised the issue his wife's credit limit was increased.The DFS said in a statement that it ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex"".""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law.""The BBC has contacted Goldman Sachs for comment.On Saturday, the investment bank told Bloomberg: ""Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.""The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.The iPhone maker markets Apple Card on its website as a ""new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank"".Leo Kelion, Technology desk editorWithout access to the Goldman Sachs computers, it's impossible to be certain of what is going on. The fact there appears to be a correlation between gender and credit doesn't necessarily mean one is causing the other. Even so, the suspicion is that unintentional bias has crept into the system.That could be because when the algorithms involved were developed, they were trained on a data set in which women indeed posed a greater financial risk than the men. This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large.Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account.A further complication is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined.""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be.""In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain.Apple's brand is the only one to feature on the minimalist styling of its card's face, and many of its consumers have higher expectations of its behaviour than they would do for other payment card providers.That means that even if issues of gender bias prove to be common across lenders, Apple faces becoming the focal point for demands that they are addressed."
business	Bank of England: Dame Minouche Shafik is current government's choice	Hawk or dove?	"The Bank of England may see its first female governor in over 300 years if the current government remains in power after the general election in December.The BBC understands that Egyptian-born Dame Minouche Shafik is the current government's favoured candidate to succeed Mark Carney when his term ends in January of next year.However, the government feels it would be inappropriate to name a successor to one of the most important economic posts in the UK before the results of the election on 12 December.A change of government in December would see a change in chancellor - the person who recommends the choice of governor.The role of governor of the Bank of England is one of the most powerful positions in the UK. The bank is responsible for setting interest rates and policing the stability and behaviour of the UK's financial sector.Although the governor is only one of a committee of nine people who set interest rates, he or she wields enormous influence over the way the UK's financial system is run.Given the UK's position as arguably the world's most important financial centre, the job comes with global influence.Dame Nemat Talaat Shafik, who is 57 and more commonly referred to as Minouche, has already served as a deputy governor of the bank and is currently director of the London School of Economics.Other candidates for the role include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe and Paul Tucker - all former or current deputy governors at the Bank.One former Bank of England insider told the BBC ""she would be a very popular appointment internally. She has very good people skills which not all the other candidates do.""The most important question perhaps is whether this potential new governor is seen as a ""hawk"" or a ""dove"".A hawk is someone who would rather raise interest rates early to head off inflation by increasing the cost of loans to discourage borrowing and spending.A dove is someone who would rather wait and see whether cheap borrowing really leads to debt-fuelled spending before raising the rates at which consumers and home buyers can borrow.Dame Minouche - who received her damehood in 2015 - has described herself in the past as an ""owl"" who would be ""wise"" when setting the rates at which we all borrow.The incumbent government may have chosen its preferred governor. But it would perhaps be unwise to assume whether it gets to make that call."
business	US banks pass financial stress tests	'Hypothetical recession'	"The 35 largest banks operating in the US have enough money on hand to withstand a severe financial crisis despite rising levels of credit card debt.That was the finding of the annual ""stress tests"" conducted by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve.The US introduced the tests after the financial crisis to monitor financial strength in the event of a downturn.The firms reviewed account for about 80% of all bank assets in the US.The tests are intended to evaluate whether banks have enough of a financial cushion to handle a global recession.Under the central bank's stress scenario the unemployment rate would rise to 10% and stock prices and property prices would plunge.The Federal Reserve calculated this would lead to roughly $578bn (£436bn) in total losses at the banks, but said their holdings of ""high quality capital"" would remain above the minimum required.The ratio of high quality capital to risky assets would fall to as low as 7.9% in the hypothetical recession, compared with the 4.5% minimum requirement, it said.Last year, the cushion was slightly higher at 9.2%.The Federal Reserve said the performance in this year's tests, the eighth since 2009, reflected changes in the US tax law, as well as higher levels of credit card debt.The central bank also said it had also measured the banks against a more severe hypothetical downturn than last year.The banks subject to review included firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as US divisions of foreign companies, such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank.Goldman Sachs, which was among the worst performers, said its internal evaluation model differs from the Fed's.It said it is examining the differences and that its financial capacity ""may be higher than this year's test would otherwise indicate.""New rules from Congress recently reduced the number of banks which are subject to the tests.After changes passed this spring, banks with less than $100bn in assets are exempt from the reviews. Previously, banks with $50bn or more were generally subject to the tests."

Other revenue was earned by its health and well-being division Connected Fitness.Within the international business, revenue was up 9% in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), up 4% in Asia-Pacific, and down 4% in Latin America.In the UK, its kit has also been worn in the past by the Tottenham Hotspur football team and tennis player Andy Murray."
business	How safe are my savings after the financial crisis?	How did the crisis affect your finances?The safety netProtection explained	"Savers - like the wild reindeer of Russia's Taimyr Peninsula - move for protection.Rising temperatures and human activity have changed the migration patterns of the world's largest wild reindeer herd. The threat of mosquitoes pushed them higher and further north to cooler ground, as their numbers fell.Amid the financial crisis, savers moved too - in their droves - worried about falling numbers of a different kind.The collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the subsequent bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds/HBOS made them worried about the safety of their savings.So they moved to a safer place. They divided their money and put their cash in government-backed institutions such as National Savings and Investments (NS&I).Savers' flight to safety was one of the most obvious reactions to the banking and financial crisis. Now, 10 years on, how safe is their money and how has protection changed?Homes: House prices in London and the south east may have risen sharply in the decade since the crisis. But in large swathes of the UK prices have still not recovered to the levels seen in 2008.Savings: The last decade has been a disaster for Britain's savers, especially many elderly people who rely on their savings income. Savers who once enjoyed rates of 5%-plus now get a fraction of that.Borrowing: Average household debt has climbed from less than £3,000 to £4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit available through plastic cards.Banking: The way we bank has completely changed. Challenger banks have emerged, and mobile technology means we increasingly sort our finances using phones. But online banking has brought branch closures - and cyber-attacks.Read our report on a decade of changesIn 2007, customers queued outside branches of Northern Rock worried that their savings would disappear amid the first run on a British bank for more than a century.The government stepped in and the nationalisation of the North East-based bank meant no savings were lost.The following year and the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the start of the global financial crisis in earnest. The fears of those Northern Rock customers were mirrored among the wider saving public.Customers ploughed money into NS&I, which runs Premium Bonds and a variety of savings products, and the now 100%-secured Northern Rock, because they saw them as a haven for savings. NS&I reported inflows of £26bn in the 2008-09 financial year.In fact, there was already a safety net in place, but it was not widely recognised and not widely understood.The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protects a certain level of savings if a bank, building society or credit union goes bust. The scheme is funded through a levy on the financial services industry.During the run on Northern Rock, the safety net only guaranteed 100% protection of the first £2,000 of savings and 90% of the next £33,000 per person, per institution. This was the equivalent of protecting £31,700.Mark Neale, who has been the chief executive of the FSCS since 2010, said it was ""rational"" for people to queue outside Northern Rock to withdraw their money.""The protection then would have left them with losses, so it was rational to question how safe their money was,"" he said.The response from the government was to increase protection to the whole of the first £35,000 of people's savings, then a year later protection was increased again to £50,000.At the height of the crisis, Mr Neale was on the senior management team in the Treasury.He describes the atmosphere at the time as frenetic, with ""all hands to the pump"".Yet, among the public, savers were becoming better protected and so less prone to panic, he argues. By mid-2009, NS&I announced that savers' flight to safety was over.The FSCS was needed as the crisis developed. When Bradford and Bingley had to be rescued at the end of September 2008, it had to protect customers' savings.The failure of some Icelandic banks, popular among UK savers, meant it was called on again.Those two events meant four million savers were protected at a cost of £20bn - money that was subsequently recovered with, for example, the sale of Bradford and Bingley's buy-to-let mortgage book in 2017.Ten years ago, it could take weeks for deposits from failed banks to be returned to savers. Now it can be done within a week.The amount protected improved too. A link was then established with European protection, meaning that by the end of June 2009, the first £50,000 or €50,000 (whichever was higher) was protected.At the end of 2010, protection rose to its current level of £85,000 per person, per institution, although the strength of sterling meant that during 2016 it was reduced to £75,000, only to return to £85,000 when sterling weakened. Joint accounts now have a protection level of £170,000. The current level of protection in Europe is €100,000.Mr Neale says that the public is much more aware of these protections. Research for FSCS suggests that more than 80% of the UK population know about savings protection.""If there is another failure like Northern Rock, they should not be rushing to pull their money out. They know we will get it back to them,"" he says.""But we must be ready for another crisis. We also need to keep pace with the changing ways that people are saving their money.""Savings may now be better protected than they were at the start of the financial crisis, but they are not better rewarded.In September 2008, easy access savings accounts at the top of the best buy tables were offering interest of 6.5%. Now the equivalent best returns are 1.4%.The financial crisis has led to a decade of low interest rates, but it also led to schemes aimed at kick-starting lending which have hit savings rates. The most significant was the Funding for Lending Scheme, launched in 2012, which provided funding to banks for an extended period.""Lenders were given a cheaper source of funding for their loan book and, as a result, no longer needed to raise money from savers,"" said Susan Hannums, co-founder of independent savings website Savings Champion.""The knock-on effect was that as best buy rates were cut, the legacy back books were paying rates that were too competitive, so there began a torrent of rate cuts to existing savings accounts.""It may be many years until the pre-crisis savings rates return, but the money that is deposited is now much better protected.The first £85,000 per person, per institution is protected under the FSCS which has a protection checker for savers.Protection above this limit is available for those who have a sudden influx of funds owing to a life event such as a divorce settlement, inheritance or pay-out from a life insurance policy. The ""Temporary High Balance"" protection covers deposits over £85,000 and up to £1m per institution for up to six months.This protection is designed to give savers a breathing space to plan what they wish to do with their lump sum.All these rules offer protection per person, per banking licence. Most bank brands will have a separate banking licence but some share one. Protection is limited to £85,000 in total for anyone with multiple accounts in banks with one licence between them."
business	Car financing crackdown 'to save drivers £165m'		"The UK's financial regulator has announced a crackdown on the car financing industry which it claims will save drivers £165m.The Financial Conduct Authority wants to ban the way that some car dealers and brokers make commission on sales.It said that some dealers make commission on the loan's interest rate, which they set.The FCA said this ""creates an incentive for brokers to act against customers' interests"".Some brokers and car retailers make a commission on the interest rate they charge customers who take out a loan to buy a car. The higher the interest rate, the higher the commission.""We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA.""By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market which will ultimately save customers money.""The financial watchdog also said it was proposing to make changes to the way in which customers are told about the commission they are paying ""to ensure that they receive more relevant information"".It said: ""These changes would apply to many types of credit brokers and not just those selling motor finance.""Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the Finance & Leasing Association, said the announcement was ""good news for the industry and consumers, as it delivers clear rules and a consistent approach to commissions"".It added: ""Many lenders have already moved to the commission models that the FCA is proposing.""The FCA will now consult on the proposals until 15 January next year and plans to publish final rules later in 2020.Earlier this year, a report by the regulator found that the industry's practice of allowing dealers to set their own interest rates was costing consumers millions of pounds a year.The FCA also discovered that only a small number of brokers that they examined told customers that they might receive commission for arranging a loan.The regulator said at the time that its aim from conducting the investigation was to ""eliminate the harm caused by discretionary commission models"".It said: ""We have found a significant difference in the amount of interest customers pay when taking a motor finance deal arranged through a broker who benefits from a discretionary commission model compared to a flat fee model."""
business	Global investors taking risks for higher returns, says IMF	Downturn fears	"The International Monetary Fund has warned that risks to global financial stability remain high.In its latest economic assessments, the IMF says lower interest rates are encouraging financial risk-taking.It also says leading economies should be prepared for co-ordinated use of government finances if there is a severe downturn.Countries that can afford to, the IMF says, should use tax and spending measures to boost economic activity.The IMF has already warned this week of weakening economic performance and risks to the outlook.Two new reports, and accompanying blogs from senior IMF officials, focus directly on financial stability and government finances.Central banks trying to combat economic weakness - which the IMF blames to a substantial extent on trade tensions - and persistently low inflation have cut interest rates and taken other steps to provide some stimulus.The IMF's economists welcome these moves, but there is also a warning that they have come at a cost:""They encourage investors to take more chances in a quest for higher returns, so risks to financial stability and growth remain high in the medium term,"" the Fund says.Low borrowing costs have led companies to borrow more and their ability to keep up the debt payments is weakening.The IMF looked at the possible consequences of an economic slowdown, half as severe as the financial crisis a decade ago. The result is sobering, IMF officials say.A total of $19 trillion of debt would be owed by firms that could not cover interest costs from their earnings.That is almost 40% of corporate debt in the economies concerned, which include the US, China and some European economies.In addition, the ultra-low interest rates have encouraged investors such as pension funds and insurance companies to seek riskier, but more lucrative assets.Low interest rates in the developed world have also led to more money going to emerging economies, where debts are building. If interest rates were to rise, it would be harder for them to keep up their debt payments.Another problem with the ultra-low interest rate policy - noted in the IMF' s assessment of the general economic outlook - is that it leaves central banks with limited options to tackle a downturn.So attention has turned to government finances or fiscal policy. The IMF's assessment of that area is that countries whose government finances are in good shape should use their budgets to support demand for goods and services.Germany is widely seen as the obvious example of a country that could do this. The government has a budget surplus - it is spending less than it collects in taxes, and has done every year since 2012.The country's economy has been hit by the global trade tensions and it might well be in recession. The government is, however, reluctant to open the spending tap, partly perhaps because the unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world.In many other economies, however, the IMF says public debt and interest burdens are high and rising. These countries need to follow prudent policies, it adds.If there is a severe downturn, though, the IMF says countries should be prepared for co-ordinated action."
business	Italy political crisis hits financial markets	'Troubles deepen'Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondentNew PM in for a rough ride - Italian press	"Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower.The prospect of fresh elections and the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability.The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%.A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%.It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years.Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output.The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%.On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%.Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower.""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"".Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said: ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth.""What is Italy's political crisis all about?Call to impeach Italian presidentItaly's economy in chartsThe turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella.He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government.But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow.How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook.But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12.At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%.Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode. But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red.Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll.""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis.""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe.""Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans.The leftist Manifesto newspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire.""The centrist daily Corriere Della Sera suggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".Read press roundup in full by BBC Monitoring."
business	Carney warns against complacency on 10th anniversary of financial crisis	Fixing the system'Economic miracle'	"The Governor of the Bank of England has warned the global financial community not to become complacent, ten years after the financial crisis led to the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.In an interview to mark the anniversary, Mark Carney said major risks remained and that although a large part of the work to ""fix"" the financial system had been done, it was not a time for complacency.He outlined four risks to the UK's financial services sector, which is one of the largest in the world and supports more than a million jobs.First, high levels of household debt which led the Bank to put in place stricter rules on lending to people who may not be able to pay back mortgages or other loans.Second, that Brexit ends with a ""no deal"" which would mean major changes to how the financial system operates in the UK and disruption to the deep ties with the European Union.Third, the high levels of debt supporting the Chinese economy and questions over whether it is sustainable.Mr Carney said the Bank had been looking at how banks in the UK would fare if the Chinese economy took a substantially negative turn. He said that in terms of international financial risk, China was ""top of the list"".The fourth risk is a catastrophic cyber-attack which would render a major bank unable to operate.""Could something like this happen again?"" Mr Carney said. ""Could there be a trigger for a crisis - if we're complacent, of course it could.""History teaches us that there are financial crises from time to time around the world, we can come up with 60 or 70 examples over the course of the last century.""We want to have our banks, the infrastructure, the core of our financial system in a position that, if they make a mistake, if they take too many risks, they bear the consequences, not the system.""Mr Carney said the Bank of England and other global regulators had done a huge amount to fix the financial system.""I think the system as a whole is fairer,"" he told me, pointing out that retail banks such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Barclays had to ""ring-fence"" their operations serving millions of customers with bank accounts, mortgages and savings, from riskier global investment banking.""We're setting up the banks - ring fencing the banks - having them hold their own funds against potential future failures, so that if there is a failure in the future, the cost is borne by big investors, not by the tax payers.""The system has changed quite fundamentally.""The governor said that regulators around the world needed to remain vigilant and that any fragmentation of global standards to try and gain competitive advantage would be dangerous.He said no one should engage in a ""race to the bottom"".""We have to think about not why things are going to go right, but what could go wrong,"" he said.""What could happen [for example] when we think about the changing relationship with the EU?""Part of our job at the Bank of England is to think about what could go wrong in that circumstance and how do we prepare our banks, our financial system, so that it's there regardless of the outcomes of the negotiations.""There are risks around Brexit, for the financial sector.""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks.""We have stressed test our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit.""He said when he thought of the major risks globally, China was at the top of the risk register.""China is a great source for growth for the global economy, it's an absolute economic miracle, lots of positives,"" the governor said.""At the same time, their financial sector has developed very rapidly, and it has made many of the same assumptions that were made in the run up to the last financial crisis.""So there's a big so-called shadow-banking sector in China, there's a lot of lending that's based on very good past-experience.""But there's so much lending that the quality has gone down quite substantially.""The level of debt is enormous relative to the size of the economy."""
business	Gordon Brown in dire warning about the next financial crisis		"The world is not ready to deal with another financial crisis, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC.A breakdown in international co-operation means nations would be unable to act in a concerted way to tackle future threats - which are many.""I feel we're sleepwalking into the next crisis"", said Mr Brown, speaking on the 10th anniversary of the start of the previous crisis.He added that some of the bankers involved should have gone to jail.Mr Brown, speaking from his living room, said: ""This is a leaderless world and I think when the next crisis comes, and there will be a future crisis, we'll find that we neither have the fiscal or monetary room for manoeuvre or the willingness to take that action.""But perhaps most worrying of all, we will not have the international co-operation necessary to get us out of a worldwide crisis.""In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Wall Street banking giant Lehman Brothers, the UK government was one of the first to press the case for using public money to recapitalise failing banks and did exactly that - pumping taxpayer funds into Lloyds, HBOS and RBS.Mr Brown, UK prime minister as the crisis unfolded, said that it was possible to counteract the evaporation of trust in the markets by co-ordinated action between governments and regulators that trusted each other.""But now with the trade wars, the disagreements over climate change, the nuclear deals that have fallen apart there is no spirit of co-operation - there is division and protectionism and I fear a new crisis would see nations trying to shift the blame to each other.""He acknowledged that the use of public money to bail out high earning bankers was a difficult pill for the public to swallow and although he insists it was necessary, he says that he is frustrated that harsher penalties weren't dished out to some of the bankers involved.""I'll be honest with you. Some of these bankers should have gone to jail and until we have proper laws that can find the guilty and show there are clear penalties, then people will think the bankers have got away with it and will go back to doing the same thing again.""What blame does he bear himself? Former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn (Lord) King has been critical of the way his government designed the regulatory regime - moving bank supervision away from the central bank to the Financial Services Authority.Mr Brown acknowledges that it didn't work perfectly, but argues that the system was designed to look at isolated outbreaks of bank distress - not a contagion which consumed the entire global financial system.No national warning system, he says, was equipped to see the full picture and no individual country could have tackled the meltdown.A global problem needs global co-operation. Without that - and with most of the tools available already used (rock bottom interest rates, trillions pumped into the system through quantitative easing) - Mr Brown paints a grim picture of our ability to face the next crisis."
business	Why Asia turned to China during the global financial crisis	Asia hit tooDon't count on just one marketAsia in, West outChinese stimulusAnother crisis?	"For many young people in Asia, going to the West to study and work is the stuff dreams are made of.But that dream turned into a nightmare for Declan Ee when he became an unwitting victim of the financial crisis 10 years ago.He was working for Lehman Brothers in the sub-prime mortgage division in London as a junior banker at the time, and was on a career path to success. Or so the young Singaporean thought.""I never felt safe after the global financial crisis,"" he tells me. ""I had really bought into the whole culture of the industry at the time.""Declan was one of thousands who lost their jobs during the Lehman Brothers collapse, an event which many mark as the start of the crisis.Overnight, credit dried up. Jobs disappeared. Banks lost billions of dollars.The developed world fell into economic disarray.As the chart below shows the US, UK and Japan all fell into recession. It has taken a decade to recover from that, and many economists would argue that we are yet to see a real recovery.Ultimately though, this was effectively a crisis of global confidence in the ability of banks to survive. Asia's financial sector wasn't spared, although it wasn't hit nearly as badly as the West.Ten years ago, many of Asia's banks were facing job losses, wage freezes and cost cutting measures.DBS - South East Asia's largest bank - was also affected. The bank had to write off millions of dollars worth of loans and investments because of its exposure to the crisis.Terence Yong Yew Tiek was on the frontline for the bank at the time and remembers how tough it was.But he says DBS - like so many other businesses in the region - was only momentarily affected, and recovered quickly because of the inherent strength in Asia's economies - and China.""Fundamentally, there was broad-based growth across Asia,"" he says. ""Whether that was in the auto sector, airlines, consumer goods, commodities, services - all of these things were actually growing because of middle-income growth in Asia. China was also increasingly a factor, and that drove demand across borders within Asia.""The global financial crisis meant Asian companies had to change tactics too.Singapore-based plastic parts maker Sunningdale Tech saw its automotive products orders from North American clients fall to zero during the crisis.The company's chief executive, Khoo Boo Hor, has vivid memories of the time.The firm had to cut salaries, shorten the working week and reduce executive pay just to survive. But the crisis taught Sunningdale a valuable lesson: you can't count on just one market.""You have to assume that if a crisis has happened in one region, it may happen in another region,"" he told me. ""So what we do today is we build a model - we don't depend on one country, one region, one product or one customer.""That growth in Asia and China coincided, some say, with an increasing disdain and lack of trust among many in the region of the West's financial practices.Investment manager Hugh Young is a bit of a crisis connoisseur - he has lived through two of them. He says the global financial crisis changed the way Asia viewed the West.""It would be the start... of Asia looking away from the West,"" he told me.""That's been a steady phenomenon, and if anything the global financial crisis accelerated that. It probably also accelerated the rise of China - which was going to happen anyhow - but now we see China playing on the global stage as big a role - arguably a bigger role - than even the US.""China was a big factor in why Asia managed to escape the global financial crisis relatively unscathed.But that's not to say China wasn't affected by the crisis. On the contrary, as Yu Yongding, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People's Bank of China, explains the turning point of China's growth happened in September 2008, after the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy.A closer look at his numbers will illustrate exactly what he means.In 2007, China's GDP growth rate was 13%.In 2008, after the Lehman Brothers fiasco, GDP fell to 9% in the third quarter and 6.8% in the fourth quarter.In the first quarter of 2009, China's growth rate fell further to 6.1%.The Chinese government ""took action swiftly"" as Professor Yu says, and introduced a massive stimulus package which didn't just help to stabilise and revive China's economy - it became the lifeline for the rest of Asia.But there are concerns that China's economy is now mired in a mountain of debt, and as the International Monetary Fund pointed out in its outlook for the world economy earlier this year, the large and opaque nature of the financial system in China poses a risk to stability.The last 10 years have seen strong growth in Asia and China and that's helped this region weather the storm during the global financial crisis.For better or for worse, it shifted Asia away from a heavy reliance on the West.But now with Asia's biggest economy - China - slowing down, the big fear is that another crisis could be brewing.No-one's quite sure where it would start this time - and how badly we could all be affected."
business	A quarter of estate agents 'in financial distress'	Do you want to buy or rent?How many bedrooms?How much is your deposit?How much can you pay monthly?Your resultsSearch the UK for more details about a local area	"More than 7,000 UK High Street estate agents are showing signs of financial distress as they face fewer sales and online competition, a study has found.The report - from accountancy firm Moore Stephens - suggests that some 27% of agents are struggling to survive.One of the main reasons is a long-term decline in property sales.Between 2014 and 2017 the number of transactions in London dropped by 20%, while sales across the UK have fallen by 1% in the past year.The number of estate agents in difficulty has risen sharply from last year, when just under 5,000 were found to be in trouble.As well as a drop-off in the number of house sales, Moore Stephens said the growth of online agents such as Purplebricks and Emoov had been a factor.""Insolvencies of High Street estate agents are increasing as online competitors continue to chip away at their sales and undermine commission rates,"" said Chris Marsden, restructuring partner at Moore Stephens.""Some areas in the UK appear to have an excess capacity of estate agents, which could mean there is not enough business to spread around as property transactions stagnate.""He also said that plans to ban letting fees to tenants - expected to come in early next year - could dent profits even more.Since 1 May, the UK's largest chain of estate agents, Countrywide, has seen its share price fall by more than 60%. It has issued two profit warnings in the past 12 months.Rival chain Foxtons has also had problems, reporting a 15% decline in revenues during the first quarter of 2018, and its share price has fallen by nearly 25% since the start of May.In comparison, shares in Purplebricks, the online agent that charges a flat fee for agreeing to sell a home - rather than a commission - have fallen by 8.2%On Monday, Purplebricks announced further expansion in North America with the purchase of an online estate agent in Canada. Purplebricks already has operations in Australia and the US.House price growth has been moderating since March 2016, when it peaked at an annual rate of 8.3%.In the year to April 2018, that figure had more than halved to 3.9%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.View affordability data by UK regionView affordability data by local authority areaThe national average isThis calculator assumes you need a deposit of at least 5% of the value of the property to get a mortgage.

business	Trump financial disclosure: What did we learn?	1. Stamp of approval for Post Office hotel2. The golf courses might have a presidential handicap3. He has maintained a global footprint4. His book sales appear to be holding up5. He's dumped most of his individual stock holdings	"The US has published President Donald Trump's annual financial disclosure report, providing a glimpse of how the businessman's far-flung dealings fared during his first year in office.The disclosure shows millions in 2017 income from rents, licences, book and television royalties, company shares, hotel management fees and golf courses.He also had pensions, including $64,804 (£48,000) from the Screen Actors Guild.Comparisons are difficult, since the previous report covered 16 months.But some insights can be gleaned, in addition to the official disclosure of a reimbursement to his attorney for a payment to a porn star to hush her claims of an affair.Mr Trump opened a new hotel in a former Post Office building in Washington in late October 2016, and it is now an important, although controversial, part of his business.The report shows Trump Old Post Office brought in revenue of $40.4m in 2017, its first full year in operation.Comings-and-goings there have been closely monitored for signs that businesses, foreign leaders and other interests might be trying to curry favour by patronising the establishment.A tracker maintained by the Washington Post noted 59 political groups, 25 business groups and seven foreign governments have paid for events or visits there. Mr Trump himself has also visited 10 times.Critics have also accused the president of using visits and fundraisers to promote his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and other properties, though they have also been the target of protests.Golf's popularity is waning and it is not known how the resorts might have performed had he not been president, but the report does not reveal gains.Mar-a-Lago earned about $25m in revenue in 2017, compared with about $37m in the 16 months from January 2016 to April 2017, according to the disclosures.Assuming the earnings occur evenly throughout the year, Mar-a-Lago would have brought in about $28m in 2016.Another Florida resort, Trump National Doral brought in $74.7m, compared with more than $115m on the previous report.Trump Turnberry, his luxury Scottish resort, earned about $20m. In the previous report it brought in less, but it was closed for part of the time.Mr Trump's interests span the globe. The president reported income from ventures in India, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Panama, among other countries.In Panama, where he lost a legal battle with his business partner, he reported hotel management fees of about $460,000, compared with more than $800,000 reported in the previous disclosure.The president's deal-making style is under the microscope, as he threatens to tear up trade deals and impose tariffs - then invites negotiation.People appear to be turning to his 1987 tome, ""The Art of the Deal"" for insight.Sales revived during the presidential campaign and maintained that range last year, bringing in between $100,000 and $1m. And royalties from some of his lesser titles, like ""How to Get Rich"", increased.Mr Trump once owned shares in a wide cross section of American companies, including McDonalds, Apple, Wells Fargo and PepsiCo.But he has switched many of his investments to mutual funds and indexes, a move that could shield him from charges of favouritism.Of course, Wall Street's ups-and-downs still matter to his bottom line."
business	'Speak up': Lloyd's takes harassment crackdown to pubs		"When staff at the Lloyd's of London insurance market fancy a lunchtime pint, many will head to the nearby pubs off Leadenhall Market such as The Grapes and The New Moon.But leaving the office behind will be harder this week, after the City institution decided to put posters up in the toilets of those pubs, urging its staff to report instances of sexual harassment they had witnessed.It is the latest attempt by Lloyd's to stamp out a culture of sexism and bullying at the market, where 500 members of staff have reported witnessing instances of sexual harassment over the past year.""Uninvited advances or physical contact. That's not a joke, that's harassment,"" reads one of the posters, while another warns against abuse masquerading as ""banter"".The firm wants to take its campaign to other pubs around the City, but drinkers at The Grapes had mixed views about it.One Lloyd's worker who did not want to be named called it ""over the top"", while someone from another insurance firm said that few people would take it seriously.But a financial consultant drinking outside the pub told me that anything that raises awareness was worth a shot: ""You hear a lot of fairly crude sexist talk among groups of mainly younger lads in here... It's a fairly toxic culture.""In March, the Bloomberg news agency revealed a catalogue of misconduct claims at Lloyd's, many fuelled by alcohol abuse. These ranged from verbal abuse to sexual assault, all against women.Since then the 331-year-old market has been trying to clean up its image as the City's last bastion of boozy boorishness.It has turned its on-site bar into a coffee shop and warned that anyone found under the influence of drink or drugs during working hours will be barred from the building. That applies not just to its directly employed staff, but the-near-50,000 pass holders - mainly brokers and insurers - who have access to the building to do business,Other measures have been brought in too, and Lloyd's told the BBC that several people had been barred for ""inappropriate behaviour"", although it would not comment on individual cases.The move to target pubs makes sense given the male-dominated insurance industry's longstanding association with boozy lunches. In a survey of 6,000 workers commissioned by Lloyd's in September, a quarter said they had observed excessive alcohol consumption at the marketplace over the past year.At The New Moon a member of the bar staff tells me they never have issues with their regulars (who, of course, include workers not just from Lloyd's but a range of nearby companies). But a barmaid at a pub nearby says she's used to men in this part of town making ""inappropriate remarks, usually after a lot of drinks"".""There is a culture of people drinking all day - they start at lunchtime and they're very polite. But when it gets to 8pm or 9pm they can be rude,"" she says.One of her male colleagues has also witnessed bad behaviour and says he does not think Lloyd's curbs on daytime drinking have worked.""In the last six months it has got busier in here. They can't drink on site so now they come here earlier. Before they would come at 5pm.""Some at Lloyd's have complained they are being unfairly maligned and that the issue of sexism goes wider than just one City organisation.A 35-year-old woman drinking at The Grapes tells me she has worked at the market for 17 years and has never seen any harassment, nor have her friends.""If there is a real-life allegation that is proven and true, then of course they have to take action. But in terms of putting posters up in the pubs that surround Lloyd's… maybe they are just protecting themselves in light of the bad press?""In Lime Street, an older man who has just left the Lloyd's building tells me that claims of a toxic work culture are ""completely overblown"".""There was very bad behaviour in the 80s. We lived through that, there was a mucky macho culture, no question. But in recent years I can honestly say it's become so strict in terms of regulatory control, management control, HR, you'd be an absolute idiot to behave like that.""Lloyd's boss John Neal is not complacent. He has called the allegations of harassment ""devastating"", and is likely to continue putting pressure on the 100 underwriting firms and 300 insurance brokerages based at the market.Commenting on the new poster campaign - which is also being run inside Lloyd's offices - he said: ""We expect all market participants to act with integrity, be respectful and always speak up. I hope this campaign encourages more people to do so."""

This is the story of two Sallys.Sally from Birmingham lost her job as an events manager and had to do a combination of bar and temporary work in order to survive.Sally from Essex had to make people redundant at her company and ended up moving back home with her mother as she turned 45.Sally Hunter, from Birmingham, had just started a new job as an events manager for a law firm at the time the crash happened.""Within two months, they were making redundancies as their major business was construction,"" she told the BBC.Sally survived two rounds of job cuts but in January 2010 was made redundant.""I was devastated,"" she said. ""I had barely built up any long service, so my payment was minimal.""My confidence was also shattered - although I understood the market conditions, I couldn't help but feel like it was my fault.""Furthermore, Sally had bought a house in September 2007, just before the housing market began to crash - and her house immediately lost 25% of its value.To make matters worse, Sally was on a fixed-rate mortgage, which in 2007 had seemed like the safest option.""If I'd gone on a tracker, my payments would have dropped by £200 a month,"" she said.Scared about what would happen to her financially, Sally found a temporary job as well as a bar job, working up to 70 hours a week to try to cover her bills.""I ate a lot of rice during this time and didn't spend money on anything that wasn't food or bills,"" she said. ""Ironically, I've never saved so much.""Within three months, however, Sally had found a permanent job, for which she considered herself ""incredibly lucky"".It was again as an events manager - but this time she was earning much more money.""Also, deciding that life couldn't get much worse, I joined an online dating service for a weekend, and ended up meeting my husband, Mark, who is a risk and data manager.""The couple have been married for six years and have a three-year-old son, Barnaby.But Sally is mindful that life could have turned out very differently for her.""I know others who really had a rough time for a number of years, through no fault of their own,"" she said.Sally Stracey from Witham, Essex, said she had to make four people redundant shortly after the global crash.""It was horrendously stressful,"" she said. ""I was working as a drawing office manager in the construction industry.""The subcontractor that I worked for got into severe difficulty. It meant all the staff below me were made redundant.""Our company went under in 2009. I'd sensed that something was wrong and left just before that happened.""But, with no job, Sally, at the age of 45, had to move 200 miles south, rent out her home in rural Derbyshire and move in with her mother, in Essex.It had been difficult at first, she said, until they had created their own spaces in the home.And then, in 2010, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and Sally was glad to be able to be there to look after her while she was ill. Sally's mother died the same year.Eventually, Sally found another job, again in the construction industry.And, 10 years later, she said: ""I am in a far, far better job, I have a new house in Essex and a great lifestyle.""Sally is also on a much better salary.And, all in all, she said, for her, the financial crash had been a ""blessing in disguise"".By Bernadette McCague and Victoria Park, UGC and social news"
business	QuickQuid victims promised 'easy' compensation scheme	'I could have put my finances back in order'	"Borrowers who believe they were mis-sold a loan by collapsed payday lender QuickQuid will need to apply for compensation via an online portal.The company's administrators, Grant Thornton, will run the system and have promised it will be ""quick and easy"".The portal is not yet live, but is expected to be similar to the claims service for ex-Wonga customers.QuickQuid's owner, US-based Enova, said on that the UK business would close. On Friday, administrators were appointed.Enova blamed ""regulatory uncertainty"" for its decision.QuickQuid has been the biggest payday lender in the UK for the past few years.Some QuickQuid customers who had already made claims must now wait to see how much they will receive in compensation.Administrators Grant Thornton said that compensation for successful claims would be ""considerably smaller"" than would have been the case before QuickQuid's collapse.That will affected former customers such as Christian White, a teacher in Basingstoke, who was expecting compensation of about £18,000.The Financial Ombudsman had ruled that 24 loans were mis-sold, but this had been disputed by QuickQuid. As a result, his case was awaiting a final adjudication, but any payout will now be a fraction of what he would have expected.""It would have made a very significant difference to me. I could have put my finances back in order and I would have been able to start afresh. This will set me back years,"" Mr White said.""I do feel very let down by the financial system and I also feel very frustrated by how long it's taken the Financial Ombudsman.""""The news means almost certainly I will not receive anything like this money. I accept that I took out these loans, I am responsible, but I had a mistaken view that I should pay back my debts instead of being called bankrupt.""QuickQuid is one of the brand names of CashEuroNet UK, which also ran On Stride - a provider of longer-term, larger loans and previously known as Pounds to Pocket. All have now stopped lending and are part of the administration process.Thousands of compensation claims have been made from customers who said they were given loans they could not afford to repay.Others, who believe they may have been mis-sold loans and have yet to make a claim, will eventually need to apply via the online portal. These will be assessed using criteria agreed with the Financial Ombudsman.However, the amount actually paid out from an eligible claim will only be calculated when the company's assets are sold, but will only be a fraction of the total compensation award.""This is because it is expected that the total value of all accepted claims received will significantly exceed the money available to be shared out,"" the administrators said.Those affected are also being invited to call customer support on 0800 056 1515 if the loan is with QuickQuid or 0800 210 0923 if the loan is with On Stride, but are being warned that lines are expected to be busy.QuickQuid was bigger than household name Wonga even before the latter folded in August last year. Administrators for Wonga recently revealed that 389,621 eligible claims have been made since its demise.Another big payday lender, The Money Shop, closed earlier this year."
business	Bank of England governor announcement postponed		The government will wait until after the general election on 12 December to name the new governor of the Bank of England.The appointment of a new bank chief to succeed Mark Carney was due to be announced imminently.However, UK governments usually refrain from making major announcements during an election campaign.Earlier on Thursday, a spokesman for the prime minister said the appointment remained on track.Mr Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada is due to leave the post on 31 January, the date when the UK's Brexit extension period runs out.Mr Carney has been in post since July 2013.Front-runners to take on the role include chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, chair of Santander Bank, Shriti Vadera, and the Bank's current deputy governor, Ben Broadbent.
business	Argentina seeks IMF financial aid 'to avoid crisis'	Reforms'Avoid crises'By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent	"Argentina is to start talks about a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday amid reports it is seeking $30bn (£22bn).Finance minister Nicolas Dujovne is due to fly to the IMF's Washington offices.After recent turmoil that saw interest rates hit 40%, President Mauricio Macri said IMF aid would ""strengthen growth"" and help avoid crises of the past.The talks come 17 years after Argentina defaulted on its debts and 12 years since it severed ties with IMF.Mr Macri said in an address to the nation on Tuesday: ""Just a few minutes ago I spoke with (IMF) director Christine Lagarde, and she confirmed we would start working on an agreement.""""This will allow us to strengthen our program of growth and development, giving us greater support to face this new global scenario and avoid crises like the ones we have had in our history,"" he said.Local media and Bloomberg reported that Argentina was seeking $30bn, although the government declined to comment.The peso has lost a quarter of its value in the past year amid President Macri's pro-market reforms.Last week the central bank raised interest rates from 33.25% to 40%.Many people still blame IMF austerity requirements for policies that led to a financial and economic meltdown in 2001 to 2002 that left millions of middle class Argentines in poverty.Argentina eventually defaulted on its debts. And although its last IMF loan was paid down in 2006, the country severed ties with the Washington-based body.Mr Macri said Argentina was suffering as a result of high oil prices and the expectation that US interest rates would rise in the coming months.Describing Argentina as a ""valued member"" of the IMF, Ms Lagarde said: ""Discussions have been initiated on how we can work together to strengthen the Argentine economy and these will be pursued in short order.""Argentina is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme as Mr Macri seeks to reverse years of protectionism and high government spending under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.Inflation, a perennial problem in Argentina, was at 25% in 2017, behind Venezuela as the highest in Latin America.This year, the central bank has set an inflation target of 15% and has said it will continue to act to enforce it.Last week's rate rise to 40% was the third increase in eight days in an attempt to boost the peso.News of the new talks may be controversial in some quarters. Many people in Argentina still blame the IMF for the policies that led to the 2001 financial and economic crisis. The country defaulted on $80bn (£59bn) of sovereign debt - the biggest in history.Millions of middle class Argentines were plunged into poverty as a result.However, Mr Macri said the new negotiations with the IMF would give the country ""greater support to face this new global scenario and avoid crises like the ones we have had in our history"".Markets reacted positively to the news, with both local shares and the peso recovering some ground.Miguel Kiguel, a former Argentine finance official who runs local consultancy Econviews, tweeted: ""An IMF line of credit is the least expensive option for growth in Argentina.""Argentina has had a turbulent relationship with the IMF.In 2013 the country was censured by the Fund over the inflation and economic growth data published by the administration of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. It was a step in a process that could ultimately have led to Argentina's expulsion from the IMF.Earlier, many had blamed the IMF for contributing to a financial and economic crisis that came to a head around the end of 2001, which set back living standards severely.Relations have improved under the current president, Mauricio Macri, whose approach to economic policy was much more consistent with that favoured at the IMF.The prospect of a new IMF loan will test that improvement. It will come with economic policy conditions, including almost certainly spending cuts and tax rises, which are likely to aggravate political strains in Argentina."
business	Productivity growth strongest since financial crisis	The productivity puzzleAnalysis: Andy Verity, economics correspondent	"The UK has seen the strongest two quarters of productivity growth since the recession of 2008, according to the latest data.Output per hour rose 0.8% in the three months to December, the Office for National Statistics said. It follows growth of 0.9% in the previous period.There was also a better than expected rise in wages. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5% year-on-year.However, unemployment edged higher, but still remains low at 4.4%.The growth in productivity - as measured by the amount of work produced per working hour - will provide encouragement to policy makers who have wrestled with the challenge of low productivity growth since the financial crisis.The economy: Three better things, one worryUK economic growth exceeds forecastsThe ONS said the surprise rise in the unemployment rate raised the question of whether the UK's long run of falling unemployment might be over.The rise in wages still lags behind inflation which stood at 3% at the end of last year. So average pay has not increased in real terms. But a pick up in wage growth is another sign that the UK economy could be shifting tack.Economists suggest that the rise in wages is significant.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, said: ""There are signs that average weekly earnings, which rose by 2.5% in the fourth quarter, are beginning to respond to the tightness of the labour market, although households are still feeling the squeeze when accounting for inflation, with real earnings falling by 0.3%.""She also described the productivity figures as ""very encouraging"".""If stronger productivity continues into 2018, the Bank of England may decide to hold at least once on raising rates this year,"" she added.Earlier this month the Bank of England indicated that interest rates were likely to go up more quickly than previously expected if the economy remained on its current track. Economist predicted there might be a rate rise as early as May.The increase in unemployment for the three months to the end of December was the first rise in the jobless rate for two years. However, the total number of people in work also continued to rise, jumping by 88,000 in the same period.Some of that increase was due to people previously classed as inactive and not looking for work moving into the workforce or registering as unemployed.""There are mixed messages in the data we've had out this morning,"" says Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC.""You've got a big rise in unemployment, a big rise in employment and a big rise in the workforce. It's not clear any one of those in isolation is a start of a trend.Ms Martins said she expected the unemployment rate to continue to rise but that rising numbers out of work could be part of the explanation for increased productivity growth.""If GDP is growing more than the number of people working in it, then productivity will grow as there is more growth per head.""It's not the nicest way to get productivity but it is effective as long as GDP growth doesn't slow too,"" she said.We used to take it for granted that we would each get better off as the economy grew.As companies and the government invested in better technology and skills, each worker could produce more goods or services per hour, bringing in more revenue to their employers - and as a result, each worker could be paid more per hour.Those improvements in productivity were for most of the last 200 years the motor of economic growth, so regular they could be taken for granted.In the past decade, that engine of improved prosperity broke down.By June 2017, the amount produced per hour was only 0.4 per cent larger than it had been nine years before.While we had had economic growth, most of it wasn't growth in the amount each worker produced or earned, but simply growth in the number of people working.Because an economy is simply people and their economic activity, when the number of people grows, so does the economy. But it may not be the sort of growth where individuals are getting better off.So used to the ""productivity puzzle"" have economists become that when the ONS estimated productivity growth of 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, many dismissed it as a blip.But now, with another estimate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter, fewer are scoffing. Maybe that old motor has some life in it yet."
business	The financial implications of divorce	A do-it-yourself divorceAvoiding solicitorsCommon issues	"The emotional upheaval of divorce can be difficult to deal with, but so too can the financial implications.The process, were it to go all the way to a contested final court hearing, can in itself cost more than £30,000, money experts suggest.On top of that, the settlement may come with its own financial pressures.Lawyers and charities say that there are ways to keep the cost down, but that irreconcilable couples must also go into a divorce or dissolution of their civil partnership with their eyes open to the potential financial squeeze.""For anyone embarking on this journey, there's no nice way to put this: it's likely to be a rough road ahead, which takes its toll both emotionally and financially,"" says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.""Even with careful planning and a sensible approach, it won't be comfortable.""Research by insurer Aviva suggests 16% of couples who separate also buy a new home, spending an average of £144,600. Money matters take an average of 14.5 months to settle after a split, it adds.More information:The most obvious way to keep down the cost of a divorce or dissolution is to come to an agreement without the use of solicitors or other professionals, particularly if it is an amicable split.In Scotland, the do-it-yourself option is set out in law and called ""simplified"" divorce or dissolution. Only certain couples can use this procedure. For example, it is not available for those with children aged under 16.In Northern Ireland, couples have to appear in person before a judge in either a county court or a High Court. However, they can appear in court as a ""personal petitioner"", without having to use a solicitor.In England and Wales, couples can do it themselves or use a low-cost online service.However, Katie O'Callaghan, of Boodle Hatfield lawyers, warned that anyone failing to get final, legal approval on their financial deal from a court - known as a consent order - can find themselves subject to a claim from their ex-partner in the years ahead.""It is not enough for couples to agree between themselves on a handshake and think that this will protect them in the future,"" she says.Legal costs can easily stack up, and even solicitors when first consulted will check whether separating couples have tried cheaper alternatives.The most popular of these is mediation.This is not relationship counselling. It can help people to agree on how to divide assets such as money, property, savings and investments. Legal aid is available to help those on low incomes with the cost.Following mediation, a solicitor can draw up the consent order.Couples with more complex issues, or who fail to agree, will go to a solicitor.The costs involved can range from £2,000 to £3,000 for a negotiated financial settlement up to £30,000 plus VAT if a contested case goes through court, according to the Money Advice Service.Couples in the process of a divorce or dissolution can apply to a court, at a cost of £255, for a financial order.This covers areas such as a lump sum payment, ownership of a property, regular maintenance payments to help with children or living expenses, and a share of a partner's pension payments.Ultimately, in many cases, a judge will decide how the couple's assets are divided between the couple.The decision will be based on the length of the marriage or civil partnership, the ages of the parties involved, their ability to earn, their property and money, their living expenses, and their standard of living.The roles played, such as breadwinners or primary carers will also be considered.The judge will make arrangements for any children first, especially their housing arrangements and child maintenance, if there are not enough assets to go around.There can be tax implications following these rulings.Ms O'Callaghan, of Boodle Hatfield, suggests that after a split it is important for couples to maintain the financial organisation in the household that they had prior to the separation.So, for example, if the husband pays the mortgage, he should continue to do so. That is because keeping the same financial arrangements will make the court proceedings simpler.She adds that courts have wide-ranging powers to find any hidden assets, so individuals should not squirrel those away, however acrimonious the split.Individuals can also find themselves worse off than they expected if they cohabit with a new partner. If they are living together, the finances of the new partner can be taken into account during a divorce settlement with the ex-partner. If they are not cohabiting, then such finances will be ignored.Ultimately, if a couple's finances are more complex, it is likely to cost more - in both time and money - to reach an agreement."
business	Carillion probed by financial watchdog		"Carillion, the UK's second-biggest construction firm, is being examined by the financial watchdog.It said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating the ""timeliness and content"" of its announcements from 7 December 2016 to 10 July 2017.During that period the HS2 contractor's share price plunged and its chief executive departed following a series of profit warnings.Carillion said it is co-operating fully with the FCA.In July 2017 Carillion said it was writing off £845m in revenue it had expected from several large contracts, and it admitted that its already big borrowings were becoming bigger.The profit warning, which resulted in the departure of chief executive Richard Howson, sent the company's shares down by about 40%.In November, Carillion issued another profit warning and warned it would breach its debt covenants, sending shares plunging again.However, it reached an agreement with its lenders last month to defer a test of its financial health, giving the company more breathing space.Carillion is a major supplier to the government and helps to maintain schools and hospitals.It is also part of a consortium building the £56bn HS2 high-speed rail link.Shares in Carillion fell by about 4% in morning trading in London to 17.3p, valuing the company at about £73m.The stock had been trading at 238p a year ago."

business	HSBC restructuring plans fuel fears of job cuts	'Significant charges'	"HSBC is planning to restructure its business after the banking giant said its performance in parts of Europe and the US was ""not acceptable"".Interim chief executive Noel Quinn said plans to improve these divisions were ""no longer sufficient"" and that it was ""accelerating plans to remodel them"".Earlier this month, the bank, which employs 238,000 people, was reported to be planning up to 10,000 job cuts.On Monday, Mr Quinn said there was ""scope"" for potential cuts,""There is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication,"" he told Reuters. However, Mr Quinn did not provide any further details on potential job cuts.Mr Quinn took over as HSBC's acting chief executive in August following the shock departure of John Flint.His remarks came as the bank reported worse-than-expected third-quarter profits.Europe's largest bank said profit before tax fell 18% to $4.8bn (£3.8bn) in the three months to September, and also warned of a ""challenging"" environment ahead.HSBC has been navigating uncertainty arising from Brexit, the US-China trade war and ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.However, Mr Quinn praised the bank's performance in Asia - the region where it makes most of its profits.""Parts of our business, especially Asia, held up well in a challenging environment in the third quarter,"" said Mr Quinn.""However, in some parts, performance was not acceptable, principally business activities within continental Europe, the non-ring-fenced bank in the UK, and the US.""HSBC's dual nature - listed in London and Hong Kong and standing astride the trade flows between east and west - has often been a source of comfort for investors, who like a bank that doesn't have all its eggs in one basket.It has also, however, been a source of discomfort for the bank and its shareholders. A dozen years ago, activist investor Knight Vinke led a campaign against HSBC's board, accusing it of corporate governance failings and urging it to stop spending money on western markets and concentrate on Asia, where there were more and more profitable opportunities for growth.Fast forward to today and those same themes run through the first financial results from Noel Quinn, the bank's interim chief executive.Mr Quinn, a battlefield promotion after the abrupt departure of John Flint in August, is clearly making his pitch for the getting the job full-time.Statements from bank chief executives are normally bland in the extreme, but Mr Quinn pulls no punches, saying performance in the UK, Europe and US was ""not acceptable"" and that restructuring plans to focus on the Asian operations would be accelerated.The bank has also warned there will be one-off financial hits in the next quarter to pay for the restructuring - which is likely to be shorthand for big job cuts to come.The Financial Times reported earlier this year that HSBC would cut as many as 10,000 jobs; given the language in which Mr Quinn has couched his warnings about the bank's performance, that looks a likely outcome.HSBC said the revenue environment was ""more challenging"" than in the first half of the year, and predicted ""softer"" revenue growth than previously anticipated.It also warned of ""significant charges"" in the fourth quarter - including those related to restructuring - if the backdrop worsened further.While HSBC warned earlier this year that profits would be hit by a slowdown in China, the broader region was profitable for the bank in the third quarter.The bank said profit before tax in Asia rose 4% to $4.7bn in the period, citing ""resilience"" in Hong Kong.It follows months of unrest in the territory that have raised concerns about the impact on the economy and the reputation of the Asian financial hub."
business	Complaints face fresh scrutiny by Financial Ombudsman	How to make a PPI claimUnder scrutiny	"The Financial Ombudsman Service will conduct an independent review following accusations that some consumers' claims were not decided correctly.The move follows an investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches into the service.The programme suggested some staff with inadequate training or knowledge were making decisions on complaints.It also raised concerns that pressure to resolve cases quickly may have led to banks being wrongly favoured.The review was announced after Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, wrote to Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the service.Ms Morgan said it was ""troubling"" that some cases may not have been decided correctly.The independent review must consider the service's approanch to decision-making, the assurance process, and the causes of low staff morale, the MP said.""The review should be demonstrably independent, all findings of the review should be published, and the committee will expect to take evidence from the reviewer.""Ms Wayman said the service's board would appoint an independent person to ""better understand and address the concerns raised"" by Dispatches.""We feel very strongly that the concerns voiced in the programme do not give a fair impression of the Financial Ombudsman Service when seen against the overall breadth and context of our work,"" she said.The service has faced a huge workload in recent years following the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal.Since 2010, when the service began handling large numbers of PPI complaints, Ms Wayman said it had found against banks in about two-thirds of cases.More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on the FCA website.A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800.Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such as Which?, MoneySavingExpert, and Resolver.Responding to a question from Ms Morgan about whether the ombudsman could reopen past cases, the chief ombudsman said it could only do so if ""material new evidence subsequently becomes available"" that was likely to affect the outcome.""And as a public body, our decision-making is of course subject to judicial review - which means our decisions come under scrutiny by the courts.""The ombudsman makes decisions on disputes between customers and financial firms that they cannot resolve themselves.Last year it dealt with enquiries from more than two million people about bank accounts, credit cards, insurance, loans and pensions.The Financial Conduct Authority has set a deadline of 29 August next year for the final PPI claims to be submitted."
business	Mercedes-Benz to cut jobs amid tougher emissions rules	New targets	"Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is to cut jobs with the aim of making more than €1bn (£840m) in savings by the end of 2022, its owner Daimler has said.The cuts - which reports say will lead to more than 1,000 jobs being lost - come as the carmaker faces challenges from new, tougher emissions targets.Daimler said that meeting new CO2 targets required ""high investments"".It added that ""the growing range of plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars is leading to cost increases"".Daimler, which aims to make savings of more than €1.5bn across its group, did not say where the job cuts would fall. But they are expected to be in management and administrative roles.""The cost burdens of meeting the [carbon dioxide] CO2 targets require comprehensive measures to increase efficiency in all areas of our company,"" said Ola Källenius, chairman of the board of management of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz.""This also includes the streamlining of our processes and structures.""He added: ""This will weigh on our results in 2020 and 2021. To be successful in the future, we must therefore act now and significantly increase our financial strength.""It's hardly surprising that Daimler is doing some urgent belt-tightening.Profits have been poor lately, and costs have been high. There's been the small matter of an €870m fine linked to the diesel emissions scandal, for example - not to mention the impact of an extended recall to deal with potentially faulty airbags.At the same time, the company is bracing itself for the impact of strict new European emissions regulations, which will be phased in from next year. These will effectively force manufacturers to sell far more low or zero-emission cars than they do today - or face steep fines.But developing electric cars is an expensive process, while selling them is not particularly profitable, at least not yet. So something has to give - and right now chief executive Ola Källenius clearly feels that Daimler needs more investment - and can afford a little bit less management.All carmakers are facing the challenge of selling more low or zero-emission models in order to meet new European Union standards.Under these rules, average CO2 emissions from new cars sold in the EU must fall to 95g of CO2 per kilometre by 2021, a 40% cut from levels in 2007.In addition, emissions must then be cut by a further 37.5% between 2021 and 2030.In addition to the cost cuts at Mercedes-Benz cars, Daimler said that the Mercedes-Benz Vans division would seek to cut personnel costs by €100m.Daimler's truck business is also planning to cut variable costs by €250m and personnel costs by €300m by the end of 2022."
business	Is shopping at Primark really a way to be greener?	How to be a greener shopper'Right direction'	"Fast fashion has a bad reputation among environmental campaigners who accuse it of fostering a wasteful culture.But leading chain Primark has hit back at its detractors, saying shopping on the High Street is better for the planet than buying online.The boss of AB Foods, Primark's owner, told the Times that its efficient global supply chains meant it was less polluting than online delivery vans.However, George Weston's assertions are questioned by energy experts.Mr Weston told the newspaper: ""Far from being a problem, we are a solution.""He said Primark, which does not have an online shop, had ""one of the world's best supply chains"".""We don't air freight the goods, we ship them, which has far lower emissions,"" he added.Mr Weston said delivery vans ""puffing their way up and down a street"" were more damaging than people collecting products in-store, which was ""more environmentally sustainable"".He dismissed concerns that Primark was selling disposable clothes, saying his customers were not ""buying them to wear just once"".So how well-founded are Primark's claims?Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US have argued that shopping online is often greener than doing it in store.That is because when a company receives an order, it can consolidate everything in a single, bigger lorry. And this beats multiple cars driving long distances to a store or shopping centre.The caveat, of course, is when people travel to the shops by bicycle or less-polluting public transport.The researchers also said the introduction of ultra-fast deliveries in recent years - which meant lorries did not always travel fully loaded - had pushed up online shoppers' carbon footprints.But Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion marketing at the University of Manchester, thinks the claims from Primark's Mr Weston carry weight.She told the BBC that by not selling its clothes online, the fast fashion retailer avoided ""the extra last mile, sending individual packages to individual homes"".She added that shipping in stock was indeed less polluting than flying it in.And she said that people tended to return more clothes when shopping online, because they were the wrong size or otherwise failed to meet expectations, and that also had an environmental cost.Source: The Energy Saving TrustOthers, like the Energy Saving Trust, an organisation that promotes energy efficiency, take a more nuanced view. It says that if people have driven long distances to get to the shops, they will indeed be creating more carbon emissions than if they ordered online.""Put more simply, if you shop locally, then you create lower carbon emissions - particularly if you can walk to the store,"" it said.""If you live further away, then it's better to shop online.""Meanwhile, the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the London College of Fashion argues both shopping in store and online harm the environment.""Online retail incurs a high carbon footprint through transportation, excessive packaging and high return rates, with little infrastructure of financial incentive to repair or process these meaningfully,"" the centre's Monica Buchan-Ng told the BBC.""But the bricks-and-mortar model also has a considerable impact, with temporary displays and high energy and building costs.Ms Buchan-Ng stressed that however clothes were bought, their price did not reflect the true environmental cost.She blamed the fashion industry for ""mass overproduction"" and called on it to ""radically decrease the volume of clothing manufactured to truly make a difference to the climate emergency"".Primark has been praised in the past for taking steps to be more environmentally friendly. For example, it has been investing in sustainable cotton, while many rivals are increasingly using synthetic polyester in blouses and dresses.It has also been using paper carrier bags instead of plastic ones since 2002.However, while the ethical fashion site Good On You last year called such measures ""a step in the right direction"", it added that they ""just aren't enough to minimise the brand's huge carbon footprint as a fast fashion chain""."
business	'Optimism reminiscent of last financial crisis'	'Not sustainable'Core missionCascade concerns'It will happen'	"The newfound optimism about the state of the global economy is eerily reminiscent of the lead-up to the last financial crisis, the head of Barclays has warned.""I do feel like that it is a little bit like 2006,"" Jes Staley told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos.""When we were all talking about whether we had solved the riddle of economic crises.""But he said big banks were now in a better position to deal with shocks.Mr Staley's comments were delivered at the opening of an upbeat forum in the Swiss resort, at which the IMF upgraded its global growth forecast for 2018 to 3.9%.Additionally, a survey of more than 1,200 chief executives by PwC found that most believed the world economy would ""improve"" over the next 12 months.Speaking on a panel ominously entitled ""The Next Financial Crisis"", Mr Staley said that despite an encouraging recovery, ""there is something out there in the capital markets"".""Equity markets are at an all time high and volatility is at an all time low - that is not a sustainable proposition,"" he cautioned.He hinted that if the stress tests that Barclays was subjected to by the Bank of England were applied to other sectors of the economy, they would not be found to be in rude health, primarily because of high levels of debt.Mr Staley also argued that the next financial shock would not be the fault of banks like Barclays and reiterated his faith in financial regulators.""On one level, pre-2008, the regulators were there just to bear witness,"" he told Davos attendees.""Today, the political body have told the regulators, I want you to regulate the system… so you avoid the next financial crisis.""Fellow banking heavyweight Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, shared Mr Staley's view that lenders were less exposed to risk, and emphasised that they had reverted to their core mission.""We are not an insurance company, we are not an asset manager, we are not a hedge fund,"" Mr Corbat said.""We are simply a bank.""Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, while sanguine about the prospect of a downturn in the near future, warned that there would be few tools left to deal with one if it occurred.""There really isn't even a Plan A for central banks,"" he said, adding that although there would be probably be further fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing, ""I don't think either would work as well as they did last time"".The risk of political upheaval, which was front and centre at last year's WEF, seems to have faded, and Donald Trump, who will bring his protectionist message to Davos on Friday, was hardly mentioned by executives.Of more concern, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, were ""low-level threats"" that could end up ruining the recovery.""The most worrisome are policy mistakes either in the United States - a fiscal shock or a trade war - or in China,"" he said, referring to overzealous interest rate rises in the former, and a rapidly reduction of debt in the latter.But Mr Behravesh added that while the risk trade friction was ""uncomfortably high"", the chances of an out-and-out trade war were still low.Ray Nolte, managing partner at ‎investment firm SkyBridge Capital, also downplayed the prospects of another crisis, but said the harmonious nature of current economic growth was of concern.""This really is a global recovery. Europe has really pulled out of it, the US is doing well, Asia is doing pretty well - much more coordinated than in past cycles where you have always had one country lagging, or one region lagging.""However, the very fact that the recovery was happening pretty much everywhere could spell bad news, he explained.""What will tend to happen is countries will get out of step at the same time. This can have a cascading effect.""""You had the US able to bail out Europe in 2011… you don't have that if everyone is in sync.""Yet Mr Nolte noted that while the global economy was motoring ahead at a steady pace - it was not yet at breakneck speed.""It's not like we are at 4% growth and the breaks are going to have to be jammed on,"" he said.""This party can go on for an extended period of time"".According to Prof Rogoff, anticipating precisely how the party will eventually end is no less tricky than it was 12 years ago.""It will happen,"" he predicted, ""somewhere none of us are looking"".Citigroup, CEO Michael Corbat struck a more sombre note: ""There is a numbness out there, there is an ambivalence out there that's concerning.""When the next turn comes - and it will come - it's likely to be more violent than it would otherwise be."""
business	'Ten years with my insurer meant a £2,000 hike'	Paying a poverty premium'Bold ideas'	"Diane's reward for staying with the same home insurance provider for 10 years was a rise in her annual premium from £1,500 to £3,500.The 76-year-old, from Kent, said: ""Being a pensioner, I don't like changing."" She ended up looking in the phone book, calling around for a deal.She is an example of the six million people who pay on average £200 too much on premiums.The City regulator has found consumers are overpaying by £1.2bn a year.Competition in the home and insurance market is not working and loyal customers are being penalised, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says.It is considering bans on automatic price rises and making firms move consumers to cheaper deals, but said ""the ball is now in the industry's court"".""This market is not working well for all consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA.""While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers.""We have set out a package of potential remedies to ensure these markets are truly competitive and address the problems we have uncovered. We expect the industry to work with us as we do so.""Mr Woolard said the review did not reveal the insurance industry was breaching the rules on a wholesale basis. But he said it was clear that changes needed to be made, and some in the industry would accept this.He said in many cases - as was the case for Diane - it was much easier for consumers to renew a policy, sometimes just by ticking a box, than it was to switch away to a cheaper deal.The FCA said that more than one in 10 people were paying very high prices for their insurance. One in three of them were vulnerable in some way, perhaps elderly or lower paid.The regulator found that some insurers targeted price increases at those less likely to switch.Possible FCA remedies include:The FCA intends to publish its final report on possible remedies in early 2020 after further consultation with the industry and consumer groups.By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporterYou have never had a problem with your insurer or bank so you have stayed with them for years.What the FCA's, and other reviews, have shown is that this is an expensive option - for home and motor cover, overdrafts and more.Loyalty does not pay.Those unable or uncomfortable with searching for a better deal online, or haggling, pay more. There is also a nod in this FCA report to the poverty premium - you get a worse deal if your finances are less ""resilient"" or you struggle with handling money.Many of the same people will be among the eight million who an independent report estimated would be left behind if the UK became a cashless society.Undoubtedly, they will feel like the financial victims of the advances in technology which have changed the way we live our lives.Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade body, said his members accepted that the home and car insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal.But he added: ""This is not an issue unique to insurance. It is important that any unintended consequences are carefully considered to ensure that a fair and balanced approach is achieved for all customers.""The consequences could be more expensive premiums for those shopping around, but the FCA said that, while it was keen to maintain a level of competition, the variation in prices to cover the same level of risk was too great.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said ""it's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working"".But she cautioned that the FCA's report set out proposals only. ""The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised,"" she said.Citizens Advice said it should not be left to the consumer to find the best deals. Rather, the market should be set up to ensure everyone is treated fairly. However, its advice to people searching for the lowest prices is:"
business	Degree-educated savers 'at risk of fraud'		"Degree-educated savers are more at risk of losing their pension to fraudsters than those without the qualification, a survey by regulators has suggested.Fraudsters often target those with larger pension pots, but also find a route to their victims by offering ""free pension reviews"".Some 14% of people with a degree told regulators they would accept a review from a company they did not know.Actual pension scam victims lost an average of £82,000 last year.It would typically take somebody 22 years to build a pension pot of that level, according to the Financial Conduct Authority and The Pensions Regulator.Pension scams start with an unexpected call, text, social media approach or email - offering a free pension review, or a way to make attractive returns on pension savings.But the money may be simply stolen or transferred into a high-risk scheme completely inappropriate for retirement savings.Many offer eye-catching returns or high-rolling investments in hotels or green energy schemes that never materialise, or instead lead to losses.In the survey of 2,000 people, 10% of those without a degree said they would accept such an approach, a lower proportion than those with the qualification.Nicola Parish, from The Pensions Regulator, said: ""Pension scammers ruin lives, stealing away decades-worth of savings with professional-looking websites, 'expert' advice and an easy manner making it tough to spot the fraud.""But once you sign on the dotted line, often there's no second chance.""In January, the government introduced a ban on unsolicited calls offering pension ""deals"" of this kind. Any firm found flouting the rules faces a fine of up to £500,000, but experts suggest fraudsters may ignore the ban."
business	Lloyds profits nearly wiped out by £1.8bn PPI hit		"Lloyds Banking Group has taken a £1.8bn hit for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling compensation, almost wiping out its third quarter profits.It takes the bank's total bill for the PPI scandal to close to £22bnThe PPI cost meant the bank made just £50m of profits in the third quarter. It also knocked profits for the first nine-months, which fell 40% to £2.9bn.Lloyds added Lord Blackwell would leave as chairman at or before the bank's annual meeting in 2021.The £50m of third quarter profits is down from £1.8bn in the same three months a year ago.The bank's chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osorio, said: ""I am disappointed that our statutory result was significantly impacted by the additional PPI charge in the third quarter, driven by an unprecedented level of PPI information requests received in August"".The City regulator set a 29 August deadline for claims for compensation for PPI, which prompted a rush of claims.Lloyds has the biggest bill of all the banks for mis-selling of the insurance policy - which was intended to cover loan payments if, for instance, customers fell ill, but was often sold to people who did not want it or did not need it.It has become the UK's biggest mis-selling scandal and led to an industry-wide bill of more than £53bn, with Lloyds incurring almost half of the total.Nevertheless, Mr Horta-Osorio said the bank's financial performance had been solid despite a ""challenging external environment"".""We will maintain our prudent approach to growth and risk whilst continuing to focus on reducing costs and investing in the business to transform the group for success in a digital world,"" he said.Lloyds - which owns the UK's biggest mortgage lender Halifax - also said that ""continued economic uncertainty could further impact the outlook"" for the business.Mr Horta-Osorio took the helm after bank was rescued during the 2008 financial crisis and since 2017 the government has not had a stake in the bank.The retirement of one of his closest colleagues, chief operating officer Juan Colombas, was also announced. He joined the management team in 2011, and will retire in July next year."
business	City traders: We want shorter working hours	'It is a long day, it is a stressful job'	"City traders have urged UK and European exchanges to cut trading hours to improve work-life balance.They say the long hours are bad for mental health and are not exactly family-friendly.""It's hard to find childcare at five o'clock in the morning,"" said April Day, head of equities at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).The idea is for exchanges to open 09:00 to 16:00, instead of 08:00 to 16:30.The AFME is pushing for the change alongside fellow trader body the Investment Association.Shorter trading hours on equity markets would cut pressure on traders and attract a more diverse range of workers, it said.Stock market trading has traditionally been seen as male-dominated, lagging behind other areas of financial services in terms of attracting women into roles,The AFME's Ms Day said her organisation had been lobbying stock exchanges in London, Paris, Germany and the Nordic region.""A shorter working day would improve flexibility for employees and attract a more diverse range of individuals on to trading floors,"" she added.The London Stock Exchange said it would launch a consultation on the request.Traders in the UK and elsewhere in Europe normally work for a few hours either side of the current 8.5 trading hours, Ms Day said.By contrast, US exchanges are open for 6.5 hours and Asian exchanges for 6.A knock-on effect of having a smaller intake of women in junior positions means that there are relatively few women in senior management positions in investment and banking trading, Ms Day said.Juggling work and childcare responsibilities can be a challenge for both men and women, she added.Nikki Martin has worked in the City for almost 20 years as a money manager and trader. After having a daughter she said she needed to hire a nanny so she could leave the house at 05:30 to arrive at work on time.Fitting in work and client meetings sometimes means late nights.""When I have client dinners that I need to attend it pretty much kills me as getting to bed at, say, eleven with a four-thirty alarm is not pleasant, not to mention the fact that I don't see my child as much as I would like to,"" she says.""It is a long day, it is a stressful job and doing this five days a week leads to burn out,"" she says.Nowadays she works one or two days a week from home. But she says she knows so many women that have left the industry or have moved sideways because ""bringing up a child is just not compatible with the job"".""Shorter trading hours in my mind would undoubtedly go some way towards rectifying this issue.""Long hours in a high-pressure job can also exacerbate any mental health difficulties traders may be suffering, Ms Day added.Galina Dimitrova, director of capital markets at the Investment Association, concurred: ""We have heard many deeply moving stories of traders' mental health and personal life being impacted by their working hours.""Whilst it is no silver bullet, we hope this European-wide review could start to lead to a step change in more efficient markets to the benefit of savers and those who operate them.""The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture in the City.It said the call from the trader associations was ""an important suggestion for a European-wide adjustment to trading hours"".""We intend to consider the request in a formal consultation with London Stock Exchange's global members and customers,"" it added."
business	Saudi Aramco unveils next stage of blockbuster flotation		The world's most profitable company has published more details about its planned stock market flotation.Oil giant Saudi Aramco's long-awaited prospectus said individual retail investors will have a chance to buy shares as well as big institutions.But the 600-page prospectus did not say how much of the Saudi firm would be sold, nor the date of the listing.It did, though, mention possible risks, including the government's control over oil output and terrorist attack.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.Bankers think the long-awaited flotation will value Aramco at $1.5-2 trillion, making the stock market listing the biggest ever.The prospectus said up to 0.5% of the company would be set aside for retail savers, but Aramco had not yet decided on the percentage for larger institutional buyers.After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice.Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest - a final value will be put on the shares on 5 December.The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.It was initially thought about 5% of Aramco would be sold, but the final figure is now expected to be half that.Amid speculation that some foreign institutional investors are cool on the flotation, the government has reportedly pressed wealthy Saudi business families and institutions to invest, and many nationalists have labelled it a patriotic duty.Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn.
business	England flooding: Why insurance may not cover damage	Is this a new debate?Does this solve the insurance problem?What else should householders and businesses think about?	"As a business owner, it is the worst kind of double-whammy - first flood waters pour through the premises, and then the insurance does not cover the cost of starting over again.Pam Webb told the BBC that her spa in Fishlake, near Doncaster, was once covered for such a situation, but not anymore.""I feel really selfish in saying this, and I hope that other people aren't in this boat, but I've lost my home and my business and my livelihood that I've worked so hard for,"" she said.""And the girls who worked for me, or worked with me, it's their livelihoods as well.""She has been looking for solace, but can find none, she said.Mrs Webb lives above her business - and so cases such as hers are quite rare.Most residents are covered for flood damage as a standard part of their home insurance policy, with the back up of a relatively new scheme to protect those in flood risk areas.This scheme, known as Flood Re, does not cover businesses in the same way. That makes this a complex area of finance, as is often the case with insurance.The result of the latest flooding in Fishlake and other areas of England has been more questions over protection and financial cover against flooding.Far from it. There have been a series of major floods to hit the UK in fairly recent years.Repeat flooding left many homeowners unable to insure their homes, or facing large, unaffordable premiums as the risk in those areas was so high.As a result, the Flood Re system was introduced in 2016 - when it was estimated some 350,000 homes would benefit.This means insurance companies should offer lower premiums than was previously the case to these householders, as the flood risk element of policies can be passed on to the reinsurer Flood Re. Many homes affected by the latest flooding would have been protected as a result.Householders who are eligible also see their policy excesses - the amount they have to pay towards a claim - capped at £250. Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs.All this should happen behind the scenes, so householders in these high-risk areas should be able to buy home and contents insurance just like everyone else. There is a register to show which areas are covered.It is paid for via a £180m-a-year levy from insurance companies - which regular policyholders effectively pay for through slightly higher premiums.So, most households will be covered for flood damage as standard, assuming they buy insurance in the first place, although not every insurer is signed up to the Flood Re scheme.""Home buildings and contents policies cover flood and storm damage. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out, your insurer will arrange for and pay the cost of any alternative temporary accommodation you may need,"" said Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers (ABI).Vehicles with comprehensive motor insurance should also be covered for flood damage.It does not for thousands of businesses, as commercial property is not covered by the Flood Re scheme.This, it seems, is part of the reason why Mrs Webb's premises - which included her home upstairs - was not covered.Brian Brown, of Defaqto - an information company which analyses insurance industry data, said that most businesses would be covered for flood damage unless they were in a high-risk area.In those areas, insurance policies might exclude flood damage, and require businesses to pay extra for the cover. Alternatively, the policies may include flood damage, but have a high excess.He suggested that those facing high insurance bills owing to their location should use a broker to find a policy that was affordable and appropriate.Businesses are not the only exclusions from the Flood Re scheme. Homes built since 2009 are not eligible.The idea is that the scheme does not want to encourage housebuilders to construct homes in high flood-risk areas, knowing they would be backed up by Flood Re. Recent, stricter building regulations should also reduce the risk.There are clear instructions for those affected by flooding.Insurance companies send representatives to areas that are affected.In general, the advice is not to throw damaged property away, to keep receipts for any emergency repairs, and not to be in a rush to redecorate as drying out can take many months. The ABI said the insurers would advise customers on these issues.Businesses should reduce potential damage by putting stock up high and use tiles on the floor - which could mean cheaper premiums through a broker.There is also a wider consideration for those buying home and contents insurance in areas that might not be at risk of flooding but which could be affected by the weather.Defaqto has found, for example, that only 21% of home contents insurance policies and 24% of home buildings policies include cover for home emergencies, such as boiler breakdown, as standard.So a sudden dip in temperature can lead to a big bill for a replacement boiler.Extra cover may be more expensive, so householders have to weigh up which is the best financial option for them.You can hear more about the impact of flooding on businesses by listening to the Radio 5live Wake Up to Money podcast"
business	IMF warns on financial stability	QE, tooRate rises	"The risks to global financial stability in the immediate future have declined, according to a new assessment from the International Monetary Fund.But at the same time, vulnerabilities over the longer term are building, the IMF warns.The very low interest rate policies of the rich countries have led investors to search for higher returns.But that, in turn, has led them to be increasingly willing to accept higher risks.There is some good news in this assessment. The strengthening global recovery - which was the focus on the IMF's World Economic Outlook - has helped reduce financial risks in the near term.Stronger growth means that borrowers, whether business or households, are more likely to get the income needed to maintain their debt payments. It also boosts confidence in the financial markets.But one of the key factors the IMF identifies as supporting the post-financial crisis economic recovery also contributes to risks over the longer term.That's the ultra-low interest rate and quantitative easing (QE) policies pursued by rich country central banks. QE has added to the downward pressure on interest rates paid by borrowers.Those lower rates have meant poor returns for investors who buy assets such as bonds that are essentially debts.So many have sought to find other investments that generate better returns, a process that has been called a ""search for yield"".In one respect, they have no choice but to seek alternatives. The QE policy of major central banks involves purchasing financial assets that are usually regarded as safe investments, mainly government debt. That means there has been less of this safe type of asset for the private sector to buy.As a result, many have had to buy more of assets where there is a greater chance of making a loss - such as shares, the debts of less creditworthy borrowers or assets in emerging markets.All this, the IMF says, helps to support the economic recovery, but ""there are risks if these trends extend too far"".There are also potential pitfalls in the gradual return to more normal central bank policy that has begun in the United States and will, presumably, take place eventually in the other developed economies, notably the eurozone, Japan and the UK.That involves higher interest rates, which would make debt payments challenging for some borrowers, increasing the danger that lenders will make large losses.The report raises some specific concerns about the build-up of credit in China. It says the authorities there have already taken ""welcome steps"" to address risks, but it says there is still work to do.There is no suggestion from the IMF that another financial crisis is imminent. But the agency is clearly keeping a very wary eye on the risks that may be building as a result of the response to the crisis of a decade ago - risks which plenty of independent observers have also warned about, often suggesting there is much greater urgency."
business	UK borrowing at lowest level since financial crisis		"UK borrowing for the year to date is at its lowest level since the financial crisis, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell to £37.7bn between April and January, down £7.2bn on the comparable period.It is the lowest figure for the period since January 2008, the ONS said.It added that it is investigating the impact of Carillion's collapse on public sector finances.At the Budget in November, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), forecast that public sector net borrowing would rise by £4.1bn to £49.9bn in the financial year to March 2018.EU rebate helps to boost UK financesFirst unemployment rise in two yearsJohn Hawksworth, chief economist at accountancy firm PwC, said it now ""looks likely"" that public borrowing will fall below last year's figure of £45.8bn and the OBR's expectations.""This will be a welcome windfall for the chancellor,"" said Mr Hawksworth. ""But we would expect him to bank it for now rather than spending it in his March Spring Statement, which looks set to be a low key affair.""The chancellor will want to retain as much room for manoeuvre as possible for his next Budget in November, bearing in mind ongoing uncertainties around the Brexit negotiations.""In January, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, showed a surplus of £10bn.It was £1.6bn lower than the surplus in January 2017 but ahead of economists' expectations of £9.6bn.January is typically a strong month for government finances due to a boost from self-assessment tax receipts.Elizabeth Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""These are strong borrowing figures, which is proof that we are fixing our nation's finances and reducing the burden on future generations.""The ONS also said that it would be looking into the impact of Carillion's liquidation on the public sector finances ""both in relation to the public-private partnership projects"" and ""the additional funding that government has provided in order to maintain public services"".""We will announce our findings in due course,"" it said.Carillion went into liquidation last month. The construction giant ran a series of crucial services for schools, hospitals and prisons."
business	Why banks will share your financial secrets	What is it?How will it work?Open Banking in actionWhat is the benefit?What are the downsides?An open goal for fraud?	"Your financial information, such as what you spend and where, and how often you go into debt is private. It is information only available to you and your bank.It has been like that for years, but all that is to change.Customers of nine of the biggest UK banks have received letters and emails in recent weeks informing them that their information can be shared, securely, with other firms. All they need to do is give their permission.The UK's competition watchdog says this so-called Open Banking regime will revolutionise many people's financial lives, helping them get better deals.Others are far more sceptical. So how does all this work and what does it mean for you?Your financial data is valuable. For example, a loan provider would be keen to know exactly when you go into the red each month.So far, this information - or data - is held by your bank. In the past, they may have been keen to sell you other products, such as overdrafts at a certain interest rate. Most people stay loyal to their bank. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that only 3% of personal customers move their accounts each year.The theory of Open Banking is that such data is owned, not by the bank, but by the customer. He or she can share it electronically and get a better deal on financial products, such as getting a cheaper overdraft elsewhere.A new set of EU rules will require banks, building societies and other financial providers to let customers easily and securely share this financial data with other banks and other regulated financial businesses.The CMA told the nine largest current account providers to be ready by 13 January.However, the regulator has since given a maximum of six extra weeks preparation time to Barclays, Bank of Ireland, RBS and HSBC. Santander-owned Cater Allen, a private bank that has 40,000 active business current accounts, will miss the deadline by a year, as it needs to rebuild its IT system.Allied Irish Bank, Danske, Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide are ready to start on time.However, a change in the law means no UK bank and building society will be able to block a third party from accessing a customer's account, assuming the customer has given permission, unless they suspect fraud or unauthorised access.In practice and in time, customers will probably see a dashboard on their bank's mobile phone app.This will show them how much money they have in their different accounts, with different banks, and eventually how much they owe on credit cards and store cards too.They will also be able to switch on other services. So, a business separate to the bank might take money left over at the end of the month and invest or save it. Another may look at how much you spend on broadband and offer to switch you to cheaper deals. Another may spot unusual transactions from someone with mental health difficulties and alert a carer.The customer could simply chose to give one of these apps access to their account information.Crucially, these services will have access to the data, but will not have the login and password details to your account. A customer can switch off these services whenever they want.A set of computer programming rules in the UK, called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), will ensure all these new services and banks to talk to each other.All of these providers will be regulated by the Open Banking regime under Financial Conduct Authority rules.Examples of new services include:Source: Open BankingThe CMA's review of retail banking decided against capping overdraft charges, claiming that this Open Banking system will allow us to shop around and switch our current account provider more easily.In time, this could be done with a one-click switch, it is said.Applications for mortgages could be dealt with more quickly, as providers and brokers could access spending history, rather than ask for printed copies of the last three months of bank statements.Early adopters say the benefits could extended beyond people's finances. Anne Boden, of mobile-only Starling Bank, says customers will be able to see exactly what they bought for lunch each day, an app could analyse the calorie levels, and then cross-check it with how much exercise that person is doing.Tightening one's belt would be literal, as well as financial.""This gives customers transparency and choice - something which the big banks have kept from them for too long,"" Ms Boden says.Customers could be bombarded with invitations to try out a new service, and could quickly lose control of their financial data, according to Mick McAteer, of the UK's Financial Inclusion Centre.He describes Open Banking as ""a daft idea"", which will lead to more financial exclusion for those already on low incomes.There is a danger, he says, of these consumers being exploited, such as through businesses offering a new form of expensive payday loan.Diane Coyle, economics professor at Manchester University, says: ""I was, and still am, sceptical about how much people will want to give access to their financial information to third party apps, and surely the steady drip of stories about security breaches since the plan was announced won't have helped.""It is hard to understand people's attitude to their data and security, though, as many cheerfully give loads of information to social media companies, but on the other hand were reluctant for the NHS to have access to their health data for research purposes.""Recent research by consultants Accenture found that 85% of those asked said the fear of fraud would put them off sharing data, and 69% said they would not share financial data with businesses that were not banks.Unscrupulous individuals would be keen to access this data and use it alongside information revealed on social media to build up a complete set of personal information.This could be used to rip off consumers if the system is not working well.But organisers say that there are strict regulations and, unlike now, all this can be done without giving access to your bank's login.If anything goes wrong and there is an unauthorised transaction, the customer's bank must refund the money and claim it back from the third party if the issue was their fault.Customers can complain to a bank or a service provider about their service. They must respond within 15 days, or 35 days in the most complicated cases."
business	Poor clothing sales see M&S's profits slide	'Too slow'	"Marks and Spencer profits dropped in the first half of its financial year following a sharp fall in demand for its clothes and home goods.The High Street retailer said that while its food business was ""outperforming the market"", there had been issues in clothing and home.Marks and Spencer is undergoing a transformation plan led by chief executive Steve Rowe.He said after a ""challenging"" first half, it is now seeing improvements.Overall, pre-tax profits tumbled by 17% to £176.5m on total sales down 2.1% to £4.86bn.Like-for-like sales in clothing and home fell by 5.5% during the six months to 30 September, worse than an expected 4.3% drop.In Wednesday's FTSE 250 trading, the company's shares fell 0.2% to 182 pence.M&S said there had been ""availability challenges"" as a result of ""supply chain issues and a shape of buy that remained too broad"".The company is facing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet.It said its clothing business ""has historically been too slow to market"" and had ""too many slow-moving lines"".M&S also said it was going to ensure that they had enough product in all sizes, and would be quicker to restock popular and fast-selling items in stores.In addition it said it would look to introduce slimmer cuts in clothing designs, which would be increasingly aimed at a ""family market"".M&S said it was seeing a positive response to its current winter season clothing, which it says is a ""better value product"".But retail expert Richard Hyman told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""I think Marks and Spencer customers are not interested in price, as much as relevance. Making clothes cheaper is not the answer.""When they talk about this season's offering, they are talking about a matter of weeks. The general outlook for Christmas trading is not looking very good across the trade.""In contrast, like-for-like sales in food grew by 0.9%, ahead of a forecast 0.3% rise.To stem the decline in food, M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado in February, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for £750m.But Mr Hyman said: ""I can't see the central logic of the Ocado deal. I don't think they have to be online in food at all. Online [food retailing] in the UK is 7% of the market, suggesting people are not clamouring to buy food online.""And Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com said that overall, change had been far too slow at the company.But M&S boss Mr Rowe said the firm was now starting to see the benefits of its transformation plan. ""For the first time we are beginning to see the potential from the far reaching changes we are making,"" he said.However, while it forecast some improvement in trading in the second half of the year, market conditions remain challenging.In September, M&S was relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies.It marked the first time the retailer had not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984."
business	Apple profits hit by slowing iPhone sales		"Apple's business is being tested by ongoing weakening of its iPhone sales.In the most recent quarter, iPhone sales dropped to $33.4bn (£25.9bn), down almost 10% year-on-year.The fall extended a streak of declines and hit the firm's profits in the quarter, which slipped about 3% year-on-year to $13.7bn.The firm's profit and revenue for the full financial year also fell for the first time since 2016, weighed down by the iPhone results.In a presentation after the firm released its earnings, Apple boss Tim Cook hastened to reassure investors that the declines in iPhone sales are slowing, thanks to the popularity of the firm's latest model, the iPhone 11.""It's early but the trends look very good,"" he said. ""We are bullish.""Mr Cook added that the firm's other businesses were healthy - sales of wearables, such as earphones and watches, surged by more than 50%, while services revenue, which includes Apple Pay and the app store, jumped 18% year-on-year.That lifted quarterly revenue to $64bn (£49.6bn), up 2% year-on-year.Mr Cook has been working to make Apple's business less reliant on its phones, with new subscription services for news and television, among other offerings, but iPhones still account for a majority of sales.Mr Cook said his optimism about the iPhone 11's appeal is reflected in Apple's relatively bright forecast for the upcoming quarter, which includes the festive season - typically a time that sees many hardware purchases.The firm said it expected revenue growth in the quarter of as much as 6%, above analysts' expectations.Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Apple also impressed investors with the resilience of its performance in its Greater China region, which accounts for nearly 20% of its business. Sales there declined less than 3%.On a call with investors, Mr Cook predicted additional growth in the region and expressed confidence that the US and China would reach an agreement that would avoid additional tariffs.""The tone, I think, has changed significantly,"" he said.Apple shares gained almost 2% in after-hours trade."
business	Saudi Aramco IPO: World's most profitable company to go public	"'Historic'What is Saudi Aramco?Why is it worth so much money?Analysis: Katie Prescott, BBC business correspondentWhy does Saudi want to sell shares in it?Analysis: Ellen R Wald, author ""Saudi, Inc."", and president of Transversal ConsultingWhy the sale is controversial?"	"Saudi Aramco has confirmed it is planning to list on the Riyadh stock exchange, in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO).The state-owned oil giant will determine the IPO launch price after registering interest from investors.Business sources say the Saudis are expected to make shares available for 1% or 2% of the firm, and the offer will be for existing company shares.Saudi Aramco is thought to be worth about $1.2tn (£927bn).The firm said it has no current plans for a foreign share listing, saying long-discussed plans for a two-stage IPO including an offering on a foreign exchange had been put aside for now.""For the (international) listing part, we will let you know in due course. So far it's only on Tadawul,"" Aramco chair Yasir al-Rumayyan told a media conference, referring to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon'Saudi Arabia denies calling off Aramco floatSaudi Arabia to open up to foreign touristsChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at derivatives traders IG Group, said: ""Investing in Aramco carries risks, of course, and not only that oil prices will struggle to move higher.""Political and strategic risks are high for any firm operating in the region, not least one which is an arm of the Saudi state. Aramco also has limited control in output policy, a key part of Saudi Arabia's Opec management.""Those potential risks were highlighted in September when drone attacks hit the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia, both owned by Aramco.But Aramco boss Amin Nasser, who called the plans ""historic"", told a media conference after the IPO statement was published that the firm was still the most reliable oil company globally.In its launch announcement Aramco said: ""The company does not expect the impact of these attacks to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations.""Saudi Aramco traces its roots to 1933 when a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the Standard Oil Company of California, which later became Chevron, to survey and drill for oil, creating a new firm to do so.Between 1973 and 1980, Saudi Arabia bought the whole company.Saudi Arabia has the second-biggest oil reserves after Venezuela, according to the Energy Information Administration. It is also second in production, after the US. But it gets its prominence because it has the monopoly on all that oil in the country, and because of how cheap it is to extract.It's essentially the world's largest unquoted company; it's a massive global oil producer,"" said David Hunter, director of market studies at Schneider Electric.""This is the absolute mother of all oil and gas companies.""Saudi Aramco is worth $1.2tn, according to analysis from financial news service Bloomberg, although Riyadh would prefer a valuation of $2tn, which is one reason the company's share sale has been delayed a number of times.Mr Beauchamp from IG Group says: ""Aramco is a world away from the tech IPOs that have been all the rage lately, but the valuation problem still haunts them like it does the firms of Silicon Valley.""He adds: ""$2 trillion probably overstates the worth of the firm in a world of high oil supply and uncertain demand, but $1.2 trillion is too low for a vital part of the Saudi state"".Once shrouded in mystery, Aramco has been transformed in the last few years as it geared up for this momentIt has begun publishing financial results, holding question and answer sessions about the company and even bringing journalists to its sites following recent drone attacks.And it has hired female Westerners to some of its top jobs. The language in today's document speaks to international concerns. It describes ""long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles"" and improving sustainability ""by leveraging technology and innovation to lower our climate impact"".Local people - even ""Saudi female divorcees"" - will be eligible to buy shares, and will receive a bonus share for every 10 they hold.Either way, it is phenomenally profitable. For the first half of 2019, it posted a net profit of $46.9bn, almost all of which was paid out in dividends to the Saudi state.Any company that profitable will attract a high price. By comparison, for the same time period, Apple, the world's largest company by value currently, posted a net profit of $21.6bn, and Exxon Mobil, the largest listed oil company, made $5.5bn.Another aspect is the cost of production. Whereas extracting North Sea oil is expensive due to its location under hundreds of feet of water, oil in Saudi Arabia is relatively close to the surface.Saudi has many of the cheapest oil fields for extraction, with some per-barrel costs below $10, says Mr Hunter. With Brent crude at more than $60, much of the difference can be profit.Saudi Arabia is keen to sell shares in its state oil firm because it is trying to reduce its reliance on oil.Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wishes to diversify his country's economy in the next decade under a programme dubbed Vision 2030.The plan includes more solar power, making use of the country's vast desert, says Mr Hunter.The first Saudi CEO of the company, Ali al-Naimi, had a vision that Aramco could become a global integrated energy company. Over his years as CEO, he expanded Aramco's assets to include downstream (refining) and other assets in the US, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan and Europe.He and his successors also expanded Aramco's footprint in Saudi Arabia with joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals. Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter today and is the only oil producer that maintains at least 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that can be brought onto the market very quickly.The fact that it is a national oil company means it has exclusive access to the best and least-expensive-to-produce oil resources in the world. This makes it hugely valuable. But there are downsides. Saudi Arabia's upstream assets aren't diversified like other major international oil companies upstream assets are. It also means that the Saudi government plays a role in the company. Historically, Saudi Arabia allowed Aramco to operate independently and did not make decisions about spending for strategy for the company. There are troubling signs that this is changing now and the government is taking a more active, and detrimental, role.How much Aramco is really worth will be determined by the market. Banks have put forth their valuations, but the market will show how much it is really worth. Different sources have quoted valuations ranging from $1.2 tn to $2 tn.The most common number floated right now seems to be about $1.5 tn, perhaps $1.7 tn, though public sentiment probably indicates that this is too high a number. In 30 years, who knows how much Aramco will be worth. We don't know what other energy technologies will develop, or not, in that time, nor what Aramco's strategic vision will produce.In September, the kingdom said it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time, launching a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors.Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030.The push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists.Politically, matters are rather complicated for Saudi Aramco right now, in light of the recent Kashoggi scandal, said Mr Hunter.""And the fact of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Anything to do with Saudi Arabia is always seen through that prism.""Another wrinkle in the crown prince's plan is the surge in anti-fossil fuel sentiment around the world, plus the comparatively low oil price compared to late last year, where prices were above $80.""The listing could be controversial because it's a massive fossil fuel listing in a time investors are becoming increasingly ethical,"" said Mr Hunter.""There are a lot of new and existing funds looking to divest from fossil fuel assets.""In May, fellow oil producer Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund said it expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings, albeit to make it less reliant on price swings in the commodity."
business	Boeing accused of building 'flying coffins'	'Casualness and flippancy'	"US lawmakers have accused Boeing of building ""flying coffins"" and engaging in a ""pattern of deliberate concealment"" as it sought approval for its 737 Max 8 plane to fly.The accusation came as Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg was quizzed by the Senate Commerce Committee.Senators said they had serious concerns that Boeing put profits over safety as it rushed to get clearance.Two deadly 737 Max 8 crashes killed a total of 346 people.Mr Muilenburg admitted the firm had made ""mistakes"".""We have learned from both accidents and identified changes that need to be made,"" he said.In October last year, a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed, killing all 189 people on board.Five months later an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing 157, after which the entire 737 Max fleet was grounded.Lawmakers accused Boeing of being aware of problems in the automated control system in the 737 Max 8, known as MCAS, which has been identified as a factor in both accidents.Senator Roger Wicker said messages between Boeing staff during certification that raised issues in the MCAS test system betrayed ""a disturbing level of casualness and flippancy"".Senator Richard Blumenthal said Boeing had rushed the approval process and engaged in a ""pattern of deliberate concealment"".He suggested that pilots had been misled and Boeing had, in effect, designed a ""flying coffin"".Boeing provided the messages to the committee ahead of the testimony.Mr Muilenburg said he had learned the details of the exchange recently could not elaborate on the communication.Families of people who died in the crash, many of whom attended the hearing, told the BBC that they felt Mr Muilenburg was evasive and should resign.""I want him to say unequivocally that he takes responsibility for the deaths of 346 people because the crashes were preventable,"" said Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members in the Ethiopia crash.Adnaan Stumo, whose sister Samya died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said Mr Muilenburg should step down ""and go to jail"".Senators also criticised the regulatory process, saying there was excessive ""cosiness"" between the firm and safety officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Mr Blumenthal described the US certification process as ""absolutely broken"".Mr Muilenburg said the firm supported ""strong oversight"" but declined to support increasing the authority of the FAA, which has been criticised for delegating too much of its oversight to company officials.Mr Muilenburg said safety is enhanced by tapping industry technical expertise.The company also disputed the characterisation of its relationship with regulators as ""cosy"".""It's not a cosy relationship. It's a professional relationship,"" said Boeing's chief engineer John Hamilton.Since the grounding of the 737 Max fleet in March, Boeing has said it is fixing software and has overhauled its review procedures.But senators said the continued delays in re-certification cast serious doubt on the initial approval.They faulted Boeing for not sharing more information about the MCAS system with regulators or pilots, despite its power to control the plane's flight path.Senator Maria Cantwell said the crashes should spur broader scrutiny of automated systems, which are becoming more common - not just in airplanes but also in cars and other forms of transportation.""This is the issue du jour,"" she said."
business	Amazon profits hit by rising shipping costs	'Softening growth'	"Amazon delivered another quarter of sales growth above 20%, but a spike in shipping costs cut the firm's bottom line.Shares dropped sharply in after-hours trade after the e-commerce giant said profits fell by about 25% to $2.1bn in the three months to 30 September.The firm said it spent nearly $10bn (£7.78bn) on shipping costs in the most recent quarter, up 46% from last year.But sales rose 24% year-on-year to $70bn.Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the company's push to offer one-day shipping to its Prime members, which has contributed to increased costs, will pay off. Purchases by Prime members have accelerated alongside the one-day offering, executives said.""It's a big investment, and it's the right long-term decision for customers,"" Mr Bezos said.However, investors were disappointed by the e-commerce company's sales forecast for the last three months of the year.Amazon said it expected sales growth of 11% to 20% in the upcoming quarter, which includes the critical festive season. It pinned that expected deceleration in part on the recent increase in Japan's consumption tax, which it said would depress purchases.The sales prediction helped to send the firm's shares down more than 6% in after-hours trade.""Whether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lacklustre sales guidance for next quarter,"" said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But, he added, ""it's been foolish to doubt Amazon in the past.""Amazon's overall revenue gain occurred despite slowing growth in the firm's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).It reported sales of almost $9bn, up 35% from 2018. Last year, the unit, which is credited with lifting Amazon to profitability, posted year-on-year growth of 46%.The deceleration is a potentially worrisome sign for investors looking at the bottom line, said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer, who called the quarter ""a very mixed bag"".""AWS has fuelled Amazon's margin expansion of late but the continued softening in growth rates will weigh on the company's profits if they can't reverse the trend,"" he said.Amazon's push into physical stores with its purchase of grocer Whole Foods also has yet to pay off. Sales in its physical stores declined 1% year-on-year, to about $4.2bn."
business	Tesla shares surge after unexpected profit		"Tesla shares have surged to their highest levels since February, after it told investors that manufacturing at its Chinese factory and plans for its next model were ahead of schedule.The firm also reported an unexpected profit of $143m (£110.7m) for the three months to 30 September.That beat forecasts, but was down more than 50% from a year earlier.Shares in the electric carmaker jumped by more than 17% in after-hours trade to about $300 apiece.Tesla has struggled with years of losses, fuelling investor doubts and casting a shadow over the shares in recent years.The firm has yet to turn an annual profit, although it recorded positive results in the final two quarters of 2018.Last year, the company took aggressive steps to slash expense, cutting thousands of jobs and reining in other spending.In the most recent quarter, operating expenses fell about 15% year-on-year to $930m, lifting the firm's bottom line, despite a modest decline in revenue.In Wednesday's earnings release, the company said it expected to remain profitable in the future with ""possible temporary exceptions"" around the launch of new products.The firm said it was ""highly confident"" it would deliver more than 360,000 vehicles this year - in line with previous estimates.The company is betting on major success in China, the world's biggest car market. Sales there had been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war.Tesla said trial production had already started at its factory in Shanghai, the first wholly foreign-owned plant in the country. However, it still needs additional government sign-off before full production gets underway, it said.""We have cleared initial milestones toward our manufacturing license and are working towards finalising the license and meeting other governmental requirements,"" it said."
business	Asos profits plunge in 'disappointing' year	Asos shares rise	"Profits at Asos have plunged after warehouse problems led to what the online fashion retailer said was a ""disappointing"" year.Over the last year, Asos has installed more robots in its European warehouses and expanded its facilities in the US.But the speed of growth hit profits, which dropped almost 70% falling to £33.1m for the year.""With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities,"" Asos said.The company said it ""lost focus"" on key areas like ""product, presentation and customer engagement"".""The transformation has been huge and we underestimated the impacts of large scale operational change being executed on two continents simultaneously,"" it said in a statement.Despite the drop in profits, sales rose 13% in the year to the end of August. Animal print, broderie and satin styles had been particularly popular, the firm said.Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online.However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning.In July, the online retailer said it expected full year profits to be between £30m and £35m, well below the £55m forecast by analysts at the time.The firm's stock price has more than halved over the past year.Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, called Wednesday's drop in profits ""inevitable"" as he said the firm was ""caught in the vice of competitive price cuts and rising costs"".""Chief executive Nick Beighton candidly admits that Asos underestimated the cost and complexity of becoming an international player,"" he said.""But the halcyon days when Asos had the online fashion marketplace to itself are in the past. It will be a hard slog getting profits back to last year's £100m.""However, investors welcomed Wednesday's announcement sending the company's share price up by as much as 17% in early trading.""Investors will be hoping that these numbers represent a line in the sand,"" analyst Richard Hunter from Interactive Investor said.But, he said: ""Without question, Asos has much to do to regain its former status as a market darling."""
business	Twitter shares plunge as ad bugs see profit fall short		"Twitter shares tumbled 17% in early trading as quarterly profits came in at less than a quarter of what analysts had predicted.The company said it made $37m (£28.7m) profit in the third quarter.Product bugs and unusually low demand over the summer hampered advertising sales.Revenues were 9% higher than the previous year at $824m, but still at the lower end of Wall Street forecasts.The micro-blogging site said revenue had been predicted to fall from the first two quarters, but that unexpected problems had weighed on sales, including bugs which had an impact on its ability to target ads and share data.Twitter has also lowered fourth-quarter revenue predictions. The firm now expects to earn between $940m and $1.02bn in the fourth quarter, down from a previously forecast $1.06bn.The social media platform did boost the number of daily users who see ads on the site, known as monetisable daily active users (mDAU), which reached 145 million, beating analyst estimates for 141 million, up 17% year-on-year.Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said the company was making improvements to the platform's algorithm.""We also continue to make progress on health, improving our ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content, with more than 50% of the Tweets removed for abusive content in Q3 taken down without a bystander or first-person report,"" he said.This crackdown on abusive behaviour is something analysts say separates Twitter from Facebook, which admitted on Thursday to being unable to confirm if hate speech from political candidates would be taken off the platform.""Twitter has focused on the core experience for their users instead of politics,"" said Wendy Johansson of digital consultancy Publicis Sapient. ""They're not out fighting a political war like Facebook - they're focused on building the best tech and getting users addicted to the tech.""Anthony Macro, head of social advertising at Croud, said the social media platform's attempts to root out bad activity would appeal to advertisers, but that their record was not flawless.""It might be even harder to convince more people to join the platform after Twitter admitted in August it may have shared users' data with advertising platforms without consent,"" he said.""With privacy so top of mind for users, across all social media platforms, it's absolutely critical for Twitter to sort these issues out if they want to make serious headway with future results,"" he added.Mr Macro said the big question for Twitter was whether it could monetise its profile and turn its political influence into advertising revenue."
business	Tesla to slash thousands of jobs in profitability drive		"Tesla said it plans to cut 9% of its workforce as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability.The job cuts at Elon Musk's electric car maker come as it tries to increase production of its Model 3 sedan and turn a quarterly profit this year.Tesla said the more than 3,000 cuts would affect mostly salaried employees and not those making its cars.Mr Musk said the move had been a ""difficult decision"".Tesla employed more than 37,000 people at the end of last year.""Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us,"" he wrote in an email to employees and posted on Twitter.""What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we can eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable.""Is Tesla heading for trouble?Musk: No 'bonehead' questions pleaseLast month Mr Musk said the company was planning a wide-ranging reorganisation that would flatten its management structure.In the email, he said the cuts are aimed at eliminating duplicate roles and he does not expect them to affect the firm's production ability.Tesla employees based at US DIY chain Home Depot and involved with the home solar business Tesla acquired when it bought SolarCity are among those affected, he said.The ""majority"" of those workers will be offered positions in Tesla's retail business, Mr Musk added.Michelle Krebs, an Autotrader analyst, said the job cuts were not a surprise.""It is clear that Tesla is under tremendous pressure to finally turn a profit and is attempting to address it by cutting overhead,"" she said.""Also notable is Tesla is not cutting production jobs at a time when pushing Model 3s out the door is a top priority."""
business	WeWork warns of job cuts after Softbank rescue	'Right-size the business'	"WeWork leaders have warned staff to expect major job cuts after a shake-up at the struggling co-working company.Softbank, the firm's biggest outside investor, has agreed to invest billions in the firm after the collapse of WeWork's flotation plans and ouster of co-founder Adam Neumann.Its chief operating officer said WeWork must now ""right-size"" the business to stem its losses.Media reports say the firm would cut thousands of workers.The Financial Times put the figure at as many as 4,000 - about a third of its staff, which numbered more than 12,500 as of June.WeWork did not respond to a request for comment on the figures.Major cuts had been expected but postponed, as the cash-strapped company, which lost $900m in the six months to June, needed money to pay severance, the Wall Street Journal has reported.On Tuesday, WeWork's board accepted a financing offer from Softbank that includes $5bn in debt.As part of the deal, Mr Neumann is to receive an exit package worth nearly $1.7bn - a move that had spurred anger among workers fearing for their jobs.In a memo to staff posted by CNBC, Softbank's chief operating officer Marcelo Claure, who was named to lead WeWork's board, said those affected by the cuts would be ""treated with respect, dignity and fairness"".""I am totally committed to open and transparent communication with you,"" he wrote. ""Yes, there will be layoffs - I don't know how many - and yes, we have to right-size the business to achieve positive free cash flow and profitability. But I will promise you that those that leave us will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness.""WeWork, which rents office space on flexible terms to companies and freelancers, grew rapidly from its founding in New York City in 2010 to more than 500 locations around the world.For years, the focus on growth overrode concerns about profitability and led the company to experiment beyond office rentals, opening apartments and schools. Those businesses are among the units expected to be sold.WeWork is also likely to focus on the US, Europe and Japan, pulling back from regions that include China and much of Latin America, the Financial Times reported.""To be candid, what we are lacking is focus on our core business,"" Mr Claure wrote.""The past two months have been challenging, and I am not going to minimize those challenges,"" he wrote. ""Fortunately, we have all the necessary ingredients to make this one of the most amazing comeback stories ever, and prove our detractors wrong."""
business	Ladbrokes owner sees profits boost despite gambling crackdown		"GVC, the company that owns Ladbrokes, says it expects its profits to be bigger than expected despite the government's clampdown on gambling.The firm still expects to close 900 stores over two years because of the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) being cut to £2.But while the use of FOBTs has fallen, in the third quarter more bets were being placed in-store.The group, which also owns Coral, said online betting is also up by 12%.In a third quarter trading update, it upgraded its profits guidance for the full year to between £670-£680m, from £650-£670m.Kenneth Alexander, GVC's chief executive, said: ""I am delighted that the group's financial performance has allowed us to upgrade our full-year earnings before interest and tax expectations again.""Online momentum remains strong across all major territories, with net gaming revenue up 12% in the quarter despite the prior period containing part of the World Cup.""In August, the company announced plans to shut 900 shops - putting up to 5,000 jobs at risk - because of the cut in FOBTs maximum stakes from £100.There were 3,500 Ladbrokes and Coral shops at the start of the year, and some 198 have already shut, with the remainder scheduled for closure by April 2021.Rival William Hill has said it will close 700 stores as a result of the regulatory clampdown. While GVC said revenue in the stores is down 18%, it still ahead of expectations.GVC indicated that customers were finding other ways to gamble, as while revenues from machines - including FOBTs - were down 36% in the quarter, there was 7% rise in betting in shops.But the biggest growth was in online gambling, boosted by a 16% rise in online sport betting revenues.

business	Micro Focus shares drop 30% on profit warning		"Shares in software giant Micro Focus International fell as much as 30% after it said sales would be worse this year than expected.The FTSE 100-listed firm had already warned in March revenue would be 4% to 6% lower for the year to 31 October.It now says sales will be 6% to 8% below last year's because of the ""deteriorating macro-environment"".The company, which bought Hewlett Packard's software business in 2017, is the largest UK-based tech firm.The economic climate had resulted in ""more conservatism and longer decision-making cycles"" within the firm's customer base, Micro Focus said.The Newbury firm, which sells software and consultancy services globally, has struggled to integrate the much larger US-based Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which it bought for £6.8bn ($8.8bn) two years ago.Micro Focus will accelerate a strategic review of the group's operations as a result of the worsening expectations, chief executive Stephen Murdoch said.The aim now would be to determine ""where performance can be improved and how the business can be better positioned to optimise shareholder value"", he said.Mr Murdoch took over as chief executive in March last year. The firm's previous chief executive departed after acknowledging the merger was proving more difficult than anticipated.""The words 'strategic review' rarely spell good news for investors, so it wasn't surprising to see the shares respond with a drop of 30% in early trading,"" commented Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.""[Hewlett Packard Enterprise] was not directly mentioned today, but it may well be part of the issue, as the company said in July the integration process was proving 'complex and significant'."""
business	Mothercare UK administration plan threatens 2,500 jobs	Shifting trends	"Baby goods retailer Mothercare has said it plans to call in administrators to the troubled firm's UK business, putting 2,500 jobs at risk.Mothercare said its 79 UK stores were ""not capable"" of achieving a sufficient level of profitability and that so far it had failed to find a buyer.It said its stores would continue to trade as normal for the time being.Analysts said Mothercare had been slow to adapt to competition from rivals and the switch to online retailing.Mothercare has already gone through a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. The process enabled the chain to shut 55 shops.The firm said the decision to appoint administrators was ""a necessary step in the restructuring and refinancing"" of the group.""Plans are well advanced and being finalised for execution imminently. A further announcement will be made in due course,"" it said.Aisa Kara's parenting journey started in Mothercare when she used its Babybond ultrasound scanning service.""I was so anxious waiting for my 12-week scan, and I don't think either of us could believe it was actually happening, so we booked our private appointment,"" she said.""Everything was OK and we viewed a heartbeat, so we left elated, and as it was in Mothercare we got to buy our first item of baby clothing at the same time.""We bought all our nursery items and pushchair from there, and my daughter and son have been dressed in Mothercare almost exclusively.""The baby clothing is beautiful and I love the vintage styles. My only complaint is that the online experience isn't as good as you would have expected from a company trying to keep up with the market.""Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""Usdaw is providing our members in Mothercare with the support, representation and advice they need at this difficult and uncertain time.""We will urge the administrators to treat the staff with dignity and respect, keep them fully informed through the administration process, do everything possible to save jobs and keep as many stores open as possible and prioritise stabilising the business to provide a more certain future.""It is understood Mothercare is in advanced talks to move its pension schemes from its British operations over to its international parent company which remains profitable.As first reported by Sky, the aim is to stop the schemes being placed in the Pension Protection Fund, which would likely result in cuts for members.The company operates in more than 40 overseas territories, which are not subject to administration.In the financial year to March 2019, Mothercare's international business generated profits of £28.3m, whereas the UK retail operations lost £36.3m.In its heyday, Mothercare had hundreds of stores. It was the go-to place for new parents. But it failed to keep up with our changing shopping habits. Mothercare's UK arm has been loss-making for years. One big reason is there's so much more competition these days.From Zara and H&M to the major supermarkets, there are no shortages of places to buy children's clothing and often at cheaper prices. And then there's online, with the likes of Amazon who are able to deliver basic kit to your doorstep within hours of ordering. It has all eaten into Mothercare's market share.Truth is, this is a business that's been losing money for a very long time. Last year's CVA wasn't enough to turn things around. Mothercare ran out of time and money to try to revive its fortunes.Mothercare's move comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates.Retail analyst Steve Dresser told the BBC that like collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook, Mothercare had failed to adapt to the world of online retail.""They got very used to fat margins and a way of trading that's store-based,"" he said.However, the firm had also lost its way on the High Street, with poor store environments that deterred customers. Ultimately, he said, people did not think of Mothercare first when it came to buying baby goods: ""I think you would be hard-pressed to know what the brand stands for.""Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mothercare had become ""a byword for trouble on the High Street"", demonstrating ""the failure of well-established brands to stay afloat"".She added: ""Other retailers, particularly those who have also previously filed for CVAs, will be concerned that these restructuring plans haven't succeeded and a more radical approach may be required in order to survive.""Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""This is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the High Street... the cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits.""Years of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience."""
business	No-deal Brexit 'could cost farms £850m in profits'	'Decimate' industriesProjected UK total income from farming (in millions)Uncertainty 'the biggest challenge'Increase in support 'inevitable'How do tariffs work?	"A no-deal Brexit could cost the farming industry £850m a year in lost profits, new research seen by the BBC suggests.Farm business consultants Andersons said that without government support increasing significantly, some farms would inevitably struggle to survive.The author of its research described a no-deal Brexit as a greater challenge than the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises.The government says it will ""provide direct support to boost some sectors in the unlikely event this is required"".Under a no-deal Brexit, farms could have to pay a tariff on goods exported to the EU for the first time.Lamb and live sheep exports could face tariffs of 45-50%, while trade and farming groups say some cuts of beef could see tariffs of more than 90%.If European firms suddenly start having to pay more for UK meat, the fear is they could quickly switch to suppliers in other countries.Other so-called ""non-tariff barriers"", like extra veterinary and customs checks at the border, could also increase costs to farmers.""It could wipe out the sheep industry in Northern Ireland,"" farmers Jo and Lindsay Best, from County Antrim, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""A large percentage of our sheep are exported into France and the Republic of Ireland, and the price of feed could go up as well. It could decimate both the sheep and cattle industry here.""Andersons modelled the impact on typical farms in different parts of the UK.Farms already receive more than £3.5bn a year in EU subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).The government has told farmers those support levels will be maintained until the next general election and that is included in Andersons' calculations.In the first year after a no-deal Brexit, profitability across the whole industry would fall by 18% - or between £800m and £850m - compared with the 2016-2018 average, its research suggests.""At the moment a number of farms across numerous sectors are heavily reliant on support,"" says Michael Haverty, who compiled Andersons' research.""Many farms are struggling to break even. If they get a hit in terms of profitability of 18%, and for some sectors significantly more, then that has huge implications for the viability of those farms.""The firm's model shows the profitability of a typical dairy farm in England will fall from 3.4 pence per litre of milk to 0.9 pence per litre under no deal.In Scotland, the typical dairy farm would struggle to break even, it suggests, while in Northern Ireland it is likely to become loss-making.Under a no-deal Brexit, dairy exports would attract higher tariffs and other restrictions which, it is feared, could lead to an oversupply of milk in the UK and falling prices.At the same time, tariffs on imports from outside the EU could be cut substantially, meaning British farmers would face competition from low-cost butter and cheese made overseas.Colin Ferguson, who runs his own herd of 200 dairy cattle on the Machars peninsula in south-west Scotland, said that would be his ""biggest concern"".""[Produce from overseas] doesn't need to meet the high welfare or production standards that we conform to, therefore our market gets undermined by cheap produce and the consumer quite rightly will buy the cheapest item on the shelf,"" he added.Mr Ferguson - who voted Leave in 2016 - said uncertainty around the UK's relationship with the EU was the ""biggest challenge"" and had already made it harder to invest in new livestock or machinery.""That clarity is vital,"" he added. ""We just need to know what's going to happen.""In the longer term, he is positive about leaving the EU - seeing it as an opportunity to redesign the system of financial subsidies paid to farms in the UK.The research by Andersons shows the impact of a no-deal Brexit will not be felt equally across the industry.Lamb and beef farming are likely to be hardest hit, especially in Wales and Northern Ireland.Other businesses - like fruit and vegetables, pigs and poultry - could see modest increases in profitability as rivals like Danish bacon attract import tariffs and become more expensive.That though is dependent on migrant labour remaining available after 31 October.Mr Haverty said it was ""inevitable"" the government would have to put in place substantial levels of financial support over a number of years, while farms in some sectors adjust.""If we look at some of the other key challenges of the past - BSE and foot-and-mouth for instance - they were significant in their own right but perhaps a bit more confined,"" he said.""A no-deal Brexit is more encompassing. It's not just within the agricultural sector, it's within the wider economy as well. On that basis it's the biggest challenge this industry has faced probably since World War Two.""The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement: ""We have been very clear that once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will replace the Common Agricultural Policy with a fairer system of farm support and our new trade deals must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers.""It added: ""As we have said before, the cash total for farm support will be protected until 2022, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.""We will also intervene to provide direct support to boost some sectors in the unlikely event this is required.""If countries do not have free trade agreements, they trade with each other under rules agreed by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).Each country sets tariffs on goods crossing its borders. All EU countries share common tariffs because they are all signed up to the customs union.EU tariffs on most agricultural products can be very high - dairy averages more than 35% and for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40%.As the UK is still a member of the EU, it applies EU tariffs to goods coming in from the rest of the world, but has no tariffs with the EU itself.But Brexit will change that.The UK has said that under a no-deal Brexit most imports would not attract a tariff, in order to keep trade flowing through ports like Dover. But it would have to offer the same reductions to all other countries as well.Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
business	TSB to close 82 branches next year to cut costs		"TSB is to close 82 branches next year as part of a plan by new chief executive Debbie Crosbie to make £100m of cost cuts by 2022.The Spanish-owned bank has 540 branches and is trying to restore its reputation after last year's huge IT failure, which hit 1.9 million customers.The outlets to be shut will be named on 28 November after staff have been told.TSB would not comment on job numbers, but it is thought that between 300 and 400 positions will be affected.Ms Crosbie replaced Paul Pester, who stepped down in September last year following the IT debacle that began in April 2018 when an attempt to move data to a new computer system went wrong.Last week, customers again faced problems, this time with wages and other payments being paid into their accounts.Announcing the new strategy, Ms Crosbie said: ""The plan we're sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future.""Our new strategy positions TSB to succeed in a challenging environment at a time when we know customers want something different and better from their bank.""The bank - which was spun out of Lloyds Banking Group - will spend £180m closing the branches and on other restructuring costs.TSB was created in 2013 under the instruction of the European Commission after Lloyds was bailed out by UK taxpayers in 2008.It started with 631 branches, which included those that were branded Cheltenham & Gloucester as well as all Lloyds branches in Scotland.That network has already been reduced in size and it is thought that under this latest reduction the staff affected will be offered redeployment opportunities where possible.Lloyds floated TSB as a stand-alone bank on the London stock market, but it was then bought by Sabadell of Spain in 2015.As well as closing branches, Ms Crosbie said the bank would spend £120m on improving its digital offering and automating some of its branches. By 2022, it expects 90% of transactions to be self-service.The bank also wants to speed up the time it takes to open and start using a current account from seven days to 10 minutes.In April, TSB had already announced that 71 branches in Scotland and 22 in England would open for only two or three days a week.Dominic Hook, national officer at union Unite, urged Ms Crosbie to rethink the latest branch closures. ""With over 3,300 bank branches having closed since 2015 this TSB news will hit High Streets extremely hard,"" he said.Last year's IT failure drove the bank to a loss in 2018, although in the first half of this year it reported a profit of £21.1m. Ms Crosbie is aiming for profits of between £130m and £140m in 2022.The humiliation of last year's catastrophic breakdown has forced TSB to abandon grandiose promises.When it was hived off from Lloyds six years ago, it pledged to be a bank you could trust, without the ""funny stuff"" that tainted other scandal-ridden banks.It wowed people with a current account paying 5% interest.Its then chief executive, Paul Pester, attacked rivals for ""savagely cutting branches"" and made a firm commitment to his outlets, promising to expand the network.The IT failure knocked a deep dent in customer trust, and then TSB cut its flagship interest rate.And now Debbie Crosbie, the boss brought in to steady the ship, is targeting branches.It is true that the rise of the internet is forcing the industry to change.But that's the point. TSB promised it would be something different. Now we see it is just another bank."
business	Shell profits plunge on lower oil prices	Brent crude oil futures price	"Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell's profits have plunged to their lowest since 2016, due to lower oil and gas prices.Shell's second quarter profits dropped 25% to $3.6bn (£3bn), far below analysts' expectations of $4.9bn.The oil giant blamed ""challenging macroeconomic conditions"" in refining and chemicals, as well as falling oil prices.In June, the price of oil slipped to its lowest level in five months due to a dim outlook for global demand.BP, its smaller UK rival, reported quarterly profits that beat expectations earlier in the week, holding steady at about $2.8bn, while France's Total and Norway's Equinor said profits fell.Shell's shares dropped 3.9% in early London trading.The company held its dividend for the three-month period at $0.47 per share for a total payout of $3.8bn.Separately, Shell said it had finished the first round in its plan to buy its own shares, having spent $9.25bn over the past year. It plans to spend $25bn by 2020.Companies say they use share buybacks to return cash to shareholders, but critics say dividends are a better way to do that and that buybacks are merely a way of flattering a company's earnings per share."
business	Samsung profits tumble as it warns of 'challenges' ahead		"Samsung Electronics saw profits plunge in the second quarter as its key chip business faltered, and the firm also warned of ""challenges"" ahead.The world's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker said operating profit fell 56% from a year earlier.The results reflect a broader industry slowdown, weighed down by the US-China trade war.The firm also faces more possible disruption to its chip business due to a trade row between Seoul and Tokyo.The South Korean firm posted operating profit of 6.6 trillion Korean won ($5.6bn; £4.6bn) for the three months to June, a 56% drop from the 14.87 trillion Korean won posted in the same period a year earlier. The result was in line with company estimates.In a statement, Samsung said weakness and price falls in the memory chip market continued ""despite a limited recovery in demand"".""The company is facing challenges from uncertainties not only in business areas but also from changes in the global macroeconomic environment,"" it said.Japan recently imposed export curbs on certain industrial materials that Seoul needs to make semiconductors and display screens.The move has raised concerns over the risk the trade spat presents to global technology supplies, and could affect Samsung's future earnings.The company also said it would focus on the launch of new products in the third quarter including its first folding smartphone, which got off to a shaky start.Samsung had to delay the launch of its new foldable smartphone earlier this year following reports of broken screens.The defects with the device proved a source of embarrassment for the firm, which has seen declining smartphone sales and faces growing competition from rivals including China's Huawei.Last week, Samsung said the Galaxy Fold will go on sale in September after improvements were made to the smartphone."
business	Asos shares slump as it warns on profits	'Risk of losing out'	"Shares in Asos have sunk after the online fashion giant said that this year's profits are likely to be much lower than expectations.The retailer said sales growth in the US and Europe had been held back by problems at its warehouses.These problems meant that the range of clothes available to shoppers in these markets had been limited.As a result, it now expects to report profits of £30m-£35m this year, well below the £55m forecast by analysts.Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said overhauling its US and European warehouses had taken longer than anticipated, affecting its ""stock availability, sales and cost base in these regions"".He added that the company was clear on what was causing the problems and was making progress on resolving them.However, Asos said that while the warehouse problems were ""short-term in nature"", it added it might take ""some time"" to regain customers who had been affected.Total sales across the group rose by 12% in the four months to 30 June, Asos said, and in the UK - where trading ""remained robust"" - sales grew by 16%.However, the ""operational challenges"" at its warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta had caused problems in the US and Europe, where sales were up 12% and 5% respectively.Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online.However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning, and the company's share price has now more than halved over the past year.Shares in Asos opened down 20% on Thursday following the latest warning, before recovering some ground to stand 12% lower.Analysts at Liberum said the latest warning suggested that serious questions needed answering.""The operational issues in Europe and the US signal to us a lack of enough senior leaders in the business with the adequate skill-set in the business to undertake the complex capital projects ongoing,"" they said.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ""Fashion fans have plenty of places from which to buy clothes and so Asos is at risk of losing out to the competition if it cannot fix its problems fast.""We live in an impatient world where so many people want something in an instant. If Asos doesn't have the stock ready to ship then consumers will simply go elsewhere.""However, Sofie Willmott, an analyst at research firm GlobalData, was more upbeat, arguing that the ""changes being made to US and EU distribution centres are vital to facilitate long-term growth in these key markets"".She added that the future ""remains bright for Asos"".""The retailer's agility and willingness to change to remain relevant to its customer base will help it to continue gaining market share, both at home and abroad.''"
business	Uber shares tumble as profit figures disappoint Wall Street	Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent	"Uber's shares went into reverse on Thursday after the taxi-hailing company unveiled profit figures that failed to live up to expectations.Revenue growth slowed in face of heavy competition, leading to the company posting its largest quarterly loss.Uber and its rivals are spending heavily to expand, but boss Dara Khosrowshahi said that the competitive pressures are easing.But that didn't stop Uber's share price tumbling 13% in after-hours trading.On Wednesday, rival Lyft reported figures that were generally welcomed on Wall Street, and there was an expectation that Uber would also post positive numbers.But Uber's loss widened to $5.2bn (£4.3bn) in the three months to 30 June, from $878m in the quarter last year. The figures reflected $3.9bn of share-based compensation expenses related to its stock market listing earlier this year.Total revenue rose 14.4% to $3.2bn, but fell short of average analysts' estimates of $3.4bn. Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.7bn in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development.Mr Khosrowshahi said the competitive environment is starting to rationalise and had been ""progressively improving"" since the first quarter. While the company continues to invest aggressively, it is expected to spend less on promotions and incentives to win market share.Uber and Lyft have historically relied on subsidies to attract riders, and have been spending heavily to expand into areas such as self-driving technology and food delivery.Uber, which admitted ahead of its Wall Street listing that it may never make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services.Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 31% from 2018 to $15.76bn, below analysts' forecasts of about $15.8bn.The number of monthly active users rose to 99 million globally, from 93 million at the end of the first quarter and 76 million a year earlier.""Uber has turned into the magical money burning machine."" That's how Publicis Sapient analyst Alyssa Altman described Uber's second quarter results. The damning words go to the heart of the company's challenge: can Uber find a way to be profitable?Its latest set of results failed to assuage sceptical investors and they gave the stock the cold shoulder. It doesn't help that its rival, Lyft, suggested on Wednesday that it could achieve profitability sooner than expected.Traditionally Uber and Lyft have spent heavily on promotions to attract riders and win market share. Both companies have said that price pressure is easing. And yet Uber's costs still rose an astonishing 147%.The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is betting that future growth will come not just from ride services, but from other businesses like food delivery. The signs are that he has clearly not yet convinced investors.For Wall Street, these numbers on Thursday show this is still a company stuck in traffic."
business	John Lewis axes third of top jobs in restructuring		"A third of senior management jobs will be axed at the John Lewis Partnership as the company streamlines its structure from February next year.The partnership is merging the managements of its High Street department stores and Waitrose grocery chain into a single team.John Lewis has been struggling in a tough retail climate.The restructuring aims to save £100m, through the loss of about 75 of its current 225 senior head office roles.One of the senior partners who will depart is Rob Collins, managing director of Waitrose, who has been with the business for 26 years. He said there was not a role in the new structure that he believed would be right for him.John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said: ""These changes will be difficult for some of our Partners and we will implement as carefully and sensitively as we can.""Employees at John Lewis, including both management and shop floor staff, are known as ""partners"" due to the company's co-ownership model.There would be ""little or no disruption"" for customers, he said, but the restructuring would create a more unified leadership team and cost structure.Last month, the retailer reported a half-year loss for the first time in its history amidst a difficult UK retail environment.""The lesson of the last two years is that we need more innovation, faster decision-making and bolder steps to align our operating model with our strategy,"" the chairman said.The company said of the customers that accounted for its greatest sales, the majority shopped at both its department stores and at Waitrose.Retail analyst Richard Lim said it was a ""bold"" move which should deliver cost-saving efficiencies.""Against a backdrop of rising costs and fiercer competition, a new leaner and flexible operating model will help restore profitability during a period of rapid change within the sector,"" he said.However, Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, warned the changes would have to be implemented carefully to avoid disruption.""The long-term impact of running a unified strategy for two retailers with such a varied proposition is questionable,"" he said."
business	Metro Bank to replace Vernon Hill as profits dive		"The founder of Metro Bank, Vernon Hill, who posed with his dog to publicise the bank when it first opened, will be replaced as chairman, the bank says.The bank had ""reached a size and scale where it is appropriate to appoint an independent chair"", Mr Hill said.The bank also reported a sharp drop in first half profits, following a major accounting error earlier this year which shook confidence in the bank.Customers withdrew £2bn of deposits over the six months to June.Half year pre-tax profits fell to £3.4m from £20.8m a year earlier, the bank said.Mr Hill, an American, set up Metro Bank to challenge the UK's traditional banks.The lender, which presents a less stuffy image than traditional banks, grew rapidly in the first few years after its launch, but in January it revealed it had miscalculated the risk level of some of its commercial loans and required additional shock-absorbing capital to support them. In May it turned to investors to raise £375m of new capital.Mr Hill, who will continue as chairman until his successor is appointed, became the face of the new bank when it was launched in 2010 shortly after the financial crisis.Its branches were branded with bold red, white and blue colours and there were posters of Mr Hill's Yorkshire Terrier Sir Duffield - officially the bank's ""chief canine officer"" - advertising its policy of welcoming dog owners.Metro Bank chose an unusual strategy, building a network of more than 60 physical branches, which open earlier and longer than its rivals', at a time when most banks were scaling back their High Street presence.The bank said Mr Hill would remain as a non-executive director and president after he steps down as chairman.While the chairman ""leads the board and is responsible for its effectiveness and governance"", Metro Bank said, as president, Mr Hill ""will continue to instil, challenge and drive the Metro Bank model"".""Vernon is the inspiration behind Metro Bank, the first High Street bank to open in the UK in over 100 years,"" said Sir Michael Snyder, a senior independent director at Metro.But he said the board shared Mr Hill's view that it was time to appoint an independent chairman to ""oversee the next stage of our journey""."
business	Swatch profits hit after crackdown on grey market	Protest impact	"Swatch has reported falling sales and profits following a crackdown on unofficial sales of its watches, and political trouble in one of its most important markets, Hong Kong.The owner of the Omega and Longines brands said net income fell 11% to 415m Swiss francs (£340m; $420m) in the first half. Sales fell 4.4%.Swatch has been taking action this year to stop its watches being sold at steep discounts online.That move hit sales.The company said it had been taking ""uncompromising action"" against dealers which have been selling watches to unauthorised retailers - often online watch sellers in Asia.Swatch has stopped supplying some dealers completely and some have been warned about their activities.The crackdown had cost it more than 100m Swiss francs in sales, but Swatch said it would have long-term benefits.In particular the company is worried that its brand was being devalued, as unauthorised retailers were selling its watches at deep discounts.Swatch also said there had been a ""double-digit"" fall in sales in Hong Kong, which it blamed on ""political turbulence"".Hong Kong has seen weeks of anti-government protests, involving tens of thousand protesters.Hong Kong is the biggest export for Swiss watch makers and Swatch described it as an ""important"" market with ""attractive margins"".Swatch is optimistic that it will see improvement in trading in the second half of the year, as it has product launches planned and sees growing online sales."
business	Has the US flotation bubble burst?	What is WeWork?'Longer path to profitability'	"One of the most hotly anticipated stock market listings of the year - the flotation of office property rental firm WeWork - is now in doubt.The uncertainty comes after the firm was reported to be facing pressure from its biggest external investor, Japanese firm SoftBank, to drop its flotation plans amid concerns about its plunging valuation.The company was valued at $47bn (£38bn) last year, but reports have suggested it is now considering a price tag of less than $20bn.Other high-profile and heavily loss-making companies - such as ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber and messaging app Slack - have struggled to maintain their initial valuations.The firms were part of a pack of much-touted ""unicorns"" - privately held start-ups valued at more than $1bn.The trio launched their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) this year in a blaze of glory. But while Slack is still trading near to the price it listed on the stock market, both Uber and Lyft are trading much lower.Backed by venture capital firms and allowed to grow while enduring big losses, the firms have faced more scepticism since listing their shares.So is the flotation bubble about to burst?There are worries over prospects for global economic growth, given factors such as the US-China trade war and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Some argue that in tighter economic circumstances, companies and consumers are likely to cut back their spending on things such as cab rides and workplace apps - not to mention spending on desk space hire.Tech analyst Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research, said: ""They are obviously very different businesses, but the connecting thread is that they are losing money, burning cash and rely on sustaining very high growth rates over time.""If there is anything that changed in the mood music, it is that multiple segments of the market are increasingly pricing in a recession.""At the same time, these new IPOs [Initial Public Offerings] are reliant on continuous sales growth just to turn a first profit.""He said Uber and Lyft were used on average some 30 times a year per person, which was not enough for the firms to make a profit.""These companies are losing money right now,"" Mr Kramer said.""Getting to scale - meaning 50 to 100 rides per active user per year - requires a far larger share of what are discretionary consumer purchases. Uber and Lyft need customers to use them more and more, but in a tighter economy, this growth may be harder to come by.""He added that the question that markets were now asking was: are these companies ""recession-proof""?Led by the charismatic Adam Neumann, WeWork offers serviced office space, often to small, start-up ventures. Critics say it must fulfil long-term contracts with landlords while using short-term contracts with its customers, making it vulnerable to downturns, should its custom dry up.The company has lost more than $4bn since 2016, burning through capital even as its revenues have doubled each year. WeWork said in its IPO filing that it could slow its expansion dramatically if it needed to become profitable.In 2018, WeWork lost $1.9bn on revenue of $1.8bn. It lost an additional $904m on revenues of $1.54bn in the first half of 2019.So far, it has not made a profit, but since starting in 2010 it has grown rapidly, spreading to 528 locations in 111 cities in 29 countries.Turning to Slack, he said the workplace communication app was in the unenviable position of competing with an offer from Microsoft.""If you are buying Microsoft software for your business, you are already getting Teams built in,"" Mr Kramer said.Microsoft Teams is a unified communications platform combining workplace chat, video meetings, file storage and application integration.Teams may not yet have all the features that Slack offers, but ""buying Slack becomes an optional extra purchase"", he added.Slack is also appealing more to ""start-ups that want to use new tools"".Mr Kramer concluded: ""If you look at the forecasts for all these early-stage growth companies that IPO, they assume continuous growth, but the market is now pricing in a lower likelihood of uninterrupted growth, and therefore a much longer path to profitability than hopeful backers originally envisaged."""
business	Sainsbury's hit by store closure costs		"Profits at Sainsbury's have been almost wiped out for the first half of the year after being hit by costs relating to store closures.In September, Sainsbury's said it would shut a number of stores, including many Argos outlets as it moves the brand into its supermarkets.The supermarket group said pre-tax profits dropped to £9m from £107m in the same period last year.Sainsbury's also announced a 1% drop in like-for-like sales.Food sales fell by 0.1%, which the company blamed on tough comparatives from last year when demand was buoyed by good weather.Like-for-like general merchandise sales fell by 2.5% and clothing dropped by 1.2%, which Sainsbury's also blamed on last year's hot weather and ""a subdued non-food market"".The store closures resulted in a £203m charge in Sainsbury's half-year results, which cover the 28 weeks to 21 September.Stripping out the cost, underlying pre-tax profit reached £238m, down from £279m in the same period last year, which is in line with forecasts.Commenting on its outlook, Sainsbury's said: ""Retail markets remain highly competitive and the consumer outlook remains uncertain.""Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said: ""The sharp fall in profits may well reflect the phasing of cost savings, but blaming the weather and higher marketing expenses suggests there is significant pressure on profit margins bubbling under the surface.""There's no getting away from the fact that sales fell across all parts of the business reflecting tough market conditions.But he said: ""The integration of Argos appears to be progressing well. It offers a truly attractive proposition for customers who increasingly bounce across physical and digital channels, often at the same time.""Earlier this year, Sainsbury's plan to merge with Asda was blocked by the UK's competition watchdog because of concerns it would raise prices for consumers.Catherine Shuttleworth, founder and chief executive of Savvy Shopper, said: ""The failure of getting that deal through - which still surprised a lot of the grocery market - has meant they have had to start on a new track for their future and review their strategic way forward.""""So it is [now] about how do you make the most of other things and make the most of the Argos tie-up in particular."""
business	WeWork founder Adam Neumann's voting power curbed	Trademark issues	"Office space company WeWork says it is changing its corporate structure in a bid to allay investor fears that have put its stock market debut in doubt.Its parent firm, the We Company, said it was reducing the voting power of founder and chief executive Adam Neumann, among other changes.The move comes amid signs of weak demand from outside investors.WeWork had been seeking a valuation of about $47bn (£36bn), but reports say this could fall to as low as $15bn.SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm that owns about 30% of WeWork, has reportedly urged the property company to drop its flotation plans.A lower valuation would be a blow to SoftBank, forcing it to write down its investment.We Company said Mr Neumann would retain majority control, but his superior voting shares would now only be worth 10 votes each instead of 20.He will also be prohibited from selling more than 10% of his shares in the second and third years after the flotation.No member of Mr Neumann's family will be on the firm's board, while any successor will be chosen by the board.This chiefly affects Mr Neumann's wife Rebekah, who co-founded the firm.SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has praised WeWork, arguing that its profitability will surge after a period of loss-making expansion.But critics say WeWork's model could leave it vulnerable during an economic downturn.The company rents office space for the long term, sub-letting that space to firms and individuals on more flexible lease terms. That could leave it liable for lease payments if it is unable to find tenants.WeWork had also faced questions about its complicated financial ties to Mr Neumann.Last week, Mr Neumann returned $5.9m worth of stock to the firm, which he had controversially received in exchange for his trademark of ""We"".Since WeWork's start in New York in 2010, it has expanded to more than 500 locations in 111 cities across 29 countries.The growth has been costly. WeWork lost about $1.6bn last year, despite revenue nearly doubling."
business	RBS faces up to £900m in new PPI charges	Mounting compensation	"RBS says its profits could fall by a third this year after a surge of last-minute claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance ahead of the August deadline.The bank said it expects to take an additional charge of between £600m and £900m after receiving a ""significantly higher"" amount of claims last month.It is a blow for the bank which only recently returned to profitability.The state-owned lender had previously forecast profits of £2.7bn for 2019.PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them.Banks and other providers sold millions of the policies, mainly between 1990 and 2010.The deadline to seek compensation was 29 August, prompting a surge of last minute claims from consumers.Santander was forced to extend its deadline for claims until 20:00 on 30 August after its online complaints form stopped working on 28 August.Nat West, which is owned by RBS, also experienced issues online and there were long waits to get through to its phone lines.RBS has set aside £5.3bn in total to cover PPI compensation, £4.9bn of which has already been spent.However, the latest charges have come as a surprise for the bank which is still 62% owned by the taxpayer.In 2018 it posted its first annual profit in a decade, after struggling to recover from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis.And in its half-year results this year, it reported a 130% jump in earnings to £2bn - its best half-year performance for a decade - as well as a special dividend of 12p a share.An astonishing £36bn in compensation has been paid out so far, with the typical payout amounting to £2,000.In May Lloyds Banking Group set aside a further £100m as compensation in May, bringing its total provision to £19.5bn."
business	The map store boss who took the long route		"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Vivien Godfrey, chief executive of maps and travel books retailer Stanfords.You'd imagine that any secret service worth its salt would be interested in who buys what maps from specialist UK retailer Stanfords.Home to the world's largest collection of maps, travel books and globes, its customers include governments and armed forces from around the world.So if two countries really don't get along, and one of them is buying a lot of detailed maps of the other from Stanfords, it might be time for alarm bells to be going off in the second of those two nations.""We have a number of military customers around the world,"" says current boss Vivien Godfrey diplomatically.Based in Covent Garden, in the centre of London, family-owned Stanfords is a 166-year-old British institution. Opening its doors in 1853, it harks back to the great expeditions of the 19th and early 20th Centuries.Its famous customers from that time included David Livingstone, who explored much of Africa, and Ernest Shackleton, who led expeditions to Antarctica. Even fictional character Sherlock Holmes was a fan.Vivien, 58, has been chief executive and chairman of Stanfords since March 2018, but her connection to the business has been a lifelong one. Her family have been majority owners since 1946, and she is now the third generation to lead the company. She describes Stanfords as having ""been part of my entire life"".However, when she graduated from Oxford University with a degree in geography in 1983, her father wouldn't let her join the family firm.""He very firmly told me 'no, you should go off and work for other companies, and get other experiences',"" she recalls. ""He said that at some point I was going to get more involved in the Stanfords business, and I would be more valuable if I had other experiences.""So after Oxford she spent seven years working for management consultancy group McKinsey, where she helped clients ""almost entirely in retail and consumer goods"". ""Part of the reason I asked to work almost solely with retail clients was that I thought it would give me the greatest benefit [for Stanfords in the future],"" she says.In 1991 she moved to US, where she spent eight years based in Minnesota, working for then retail group Grand Metropolitan (later Diageo). Two of the main brands she focused on were canned vegetables business Green Giant, and ice cream subsidiary Haagen-Dazs.Vivien's decision to finally take up the top job at Stanfords 19 months ago came as the business was having some difficulties. Its old, three-storey store on Long Acre, Covent Garden, which had been open since 1901, was by then far too big for the company. As a result, Stanfords was making a loss, and its future was at risk.The company's former chief executive had resigned, and Vivien had tasked herself with finding both a replacement boss, and a new, smaller premises. But as she got more involved, she says she realised that it was finally time for her to take up the top position.""I just felt that it was the right moment, that I was ready to do this,"" she says.So taking charge she successfully found a new smaller premises for Stanfords' main store, in a new development just 100m away. The company moved in January of this year. Vivien adds that the business, which is set to see revenues of up to £10m in its current financial year, has already now returned to profitability.""We are now trading in roughly 5,000 sq ft (465 sq m) and previously we were at about 7,000,"" she says. ""Some of our regular customers were disappointed. But when either I, or members of staff, explained to them that it was a question of either remaining where we were and going out of business, or leaving and thriving, everyone understood.""More The Boss features:While Stanfords has long had an online and telephone sales operation, bricks and mortar still account for 80% of its sales. In addition to its core London shop, it has a second store in Bristol, and an outlet at the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, also in the UK capital.Another small store also recently opened in a new market development in Covent Garden, and a shop is planned for Manchester. Currently the business employs 55 people.""Bricks and mortar retailing still has a bright future, but the shops have to be the right size,"" she says. ""That is key.""Now exporting 20% of its maps, travel books and globes, Vivien says that maps make up between 40% and 50% of its turnover. And that the split between physical and digital maps is half and half.Vivien says she is untroubled by Google offering free maps on line. ""People will always be happy to pay for really detailed, really specialist, made-to-order maps,"" she says. And she is dismissive of online-only retailers like Amazon. ""We pride ourselves on offering the best possible customer service, Amazon offers none.""Travel industry expert Mike Bugsgang says that Stanfords ""is a London institution like Fortnum & Mason or Liberty"".""We are constantly being reminded of the frailties of the retail sector in the face of the seemingly inextricable growth of online sales by companies such as Amazon,"" he says. ""However, a major advantage that Stanfords has in the highly competitive book sales sector is its heritage. The store is an attraction for tourists and Londoners alike.""With many of Stanfords' customers about to go travelling overseas, Vivien says that the company is set to launch a carbon offsetting scheme. She say she will be using this herself, as her family home is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.She and her American husband moved to Florida in 2001 when they purchased a business called Bluewater Books and Charts, which Vivien describes as ""the Stanfords of the sea"".While her partner continues to run Bluewater, she spends three weeks out of every four in London leading Stanfords. ""It obviously isn't ideal,"" she says. ""But we email each other every morning to say what we are up to that day, and then we Facetime every evening.""Regarding the military customers, Vivien says that while they all switched to digital maps 10 or so years ago, they are now rushing back to paper ones.""You just don't get any perspective if you are looking at a map on a small screen,"" she says. ""And the batteries on handheld devices run out, especially in very cold environments."""
business	Superdry issues another profit warning	'Fundamental disagreement'	"Fashion chain Superdry has issued another profits warning, just weeks after founder Julian Dunkerton returned to the retailer.The company said full-year pre-tax profits would be lower than analysts' expectations, partly due to weak wholesale and online sales.Full-year sales were flat, but were down 4.5% in the final three months.Mr Dunkerton's return, after a very public dispute, sparked the resignation of eight members of the firm's board.The latest alert from Superdry follows profit warnings from the company in October and December last year.Mr Dunkerton had criticised the retailer for following a ""misguided strategy"" since he left the firm in 2016, and last month, shareholders narrowly voted him back on to the company's board.In a statement, Superdry said that since Mr Dunkerton's return as interim chief executive he had ""already identified immediate opportunities to improve the efficiency and performance of the business, and taken action to implement these opportunities"".Mr Dunkerton said his first priority had been to ""stabilise the situation"".""All of us in the business are putting all our energy into getting the product ranges right and improving the ecommerce proposition, which are two important steps towards addressing Superdry's recent weak performance.""The impact of the changes we are making will take time to come through in the numbers but I'm confident we are heading in the right direction.""Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the latest profit warning was ""another sign of the scale of the task at hand for Julian Dunkerton now he is back at the top"".In the year to 27 April, wholesale revenues rose by 3.6%, but they fell by 9.3% in the last three months of the year as a result of more goods being returned, lower-than-expected orders and the decision not to supply customers who had reached their credit limits.Online sales rose by 1.6% over the year to £163.7m but fell by 3.9% in the final three months, due to less discounting.Sales in stores actually rose by 2.2% in the final three months but fell by 3.7% over the year as a whole.Superdry, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham 16 years ago, was set up by by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success.More recently, though it has struggled.Its shares have lost more than 70% over the past year and in March the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs.Mr Holder left the company in 2016 and Mr Dunkerton stepped down last year citing ""other demands on his time"", although more recently he blamed ""my fundamental disagreement"" with the company's strategy.Mr Dunkerton criticised the retailer's strategy - including a reduction in stock both in stores and online - which he claimed he had always predicted would fail.Prior to his recent return to the business, he had accused Superdry of having undergone a ""dramatic shift from being a design-led business with innovative creative input, a strong brand identity and an innate understanding of the customer, to follow a misguided consultant-led business model""."
business	Investors sell Ted Baker shares after profit warning	'Unseasonable weather'	"Shares in Ted Baker lost more than a quarter of their value on Tuesday morning after the firm said profits would fall short of expectations.In response to the profit warning, investors sold off shares wiping more than £150m from the company's value.The fashion house blamed ""extremely difficult"" trading conditions for the lower than expected earnings.It is the latest setback for the firm after its founder, Ray Kelvin, left in March following harassment allegations.The company complained of ""unseasonable weather"" across North America and a ""highly promotional"" sales environment as it said profits for the year ending January 2020 were likely to be between £50m and £60m.The estimate falls short of the £70.9m it was expecting.""The scale of today's profit warning at Ted Baker will raise eyebrows... there will be questions around founder Ray Kelvin's departure and the wider question of how to get Ted back on point,"" analysts at Peel Hunt said in a note.In March, Ted Baker reported its first drop in annual profits since 2008, as traditional bricks and mortar clothing stores struggled to compete with online retailers and British consumers tightened their purse strings.Mr Kelvin, who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988, resigned in March over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". He has denied all allegations of misconduct.Lindsay Page, who replaced Mr Kelvin, told Reuters: ""The markets that we trade in have been extremely challenging and that has also led to levels of discounting I think we've rarely seen before, particularly in the UK.""""Several of our new product initiatives will commence imminently and we are confident in our collections for the coming season,"" she said in a statement to the stock market.Analysts at Liberum said the believed the ""short-term and identifiable issues around product"" were being addressed quickly but the ""unpredictable trading backdrop across all markets appears to have less end in sight""."
business	Norwegian Air chief executive Bjørn Kjos steps down	Strategy shiftAnalysis	"The chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle, Bjørn Kjos, has stepped down after 17 years in charge at the airline.Under the leadership of Mr Kjos, aged 72, Norwegian Air developed from a small domestic airline into Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier.It also broke into the transatlantic market with low fares.However, the firm has struggled to make profits and has also been hit by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane.Norwegian has 18 of the aircraft and on Thursday said that it did not expect them to return to service until October, later than its previous estimate of August.The airline said the grounding could cost as much as 700m Norwegian kroner (£65m; $82m) this year, and could also undo its plan to return to profitability.The 737 Max fleet of jets was grounded after two crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines' flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed.Norwegian's low fares have allowed it to grow rapidly. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff.Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport.It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa, according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.However, that growth has come at the expense of profits.The airline lost 1.45bn kroner last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft.In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft.Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot, has pledged to slow the airline's growth and focus on profitability this year.He said that strategy was reflected in the company's second-quarter results, released earlier on Thursday, which show a net profit of 82.8m kroner.""Norwegian's Q2 results show that we are delivering on our strategy of moving from growth to profitability,"" he said.""Despite operational issues outside of our control, like the grounding of our 737 Max fleet, we are delivering the highest second quarter operating revenue in the history of Norwegian.""Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondentBjørn Kjos was one of the founders of the company. As the man in the pilot's seat since 2002, he was also the driving force behind its expansion from a tiny regional carrier to become a major player in Europe's low-cost market. He also led the move into the long-haul market, using a new generation of efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to offer cheap flights to the US, South America and even Thailand.There was no shortage of passengers, but all of this growth came at a cost. The airline has billions of dollars' worth of debt and, over the past couple of years, has racked up hefty losses. In March, it was forced to sell new shares in order to raise hundreds of millions of pounds in new funding. It's also had to cut routes and sell some planes.The signs are that this radical action is starting to take effect, giving Mr Kjos the chance to bow out on a positive note. A new leader can now be appointed to guide the company, as it attempts to turn market share into sustainable profits. It won't be easy. As the likes of Monarch, Flybe and Air Berlin have shown, the low-cost market is a harsh environment, where only the fittest survive.Of course, there is another option. A new chief executive might be more willing than Mr Kjos to consider a takeover approach - from British Airways' parent IAG, for example. But let's not forget that the outgoing chief executive will remain a powerful influence within the company, both through the shareholding of his company, HBK Holding, but also through his new role as an adviser."
business	Sainsbury's to close 60 Argos stores to cut costs	Value brands'Few tweaks'	"Sainsbury's is shutting another 60 to 70 Argos shops and moving them inside its supermarkets as part of a reorganisation.It will also close up to 15 supermarkets and 40 convenience stores.The closures are part of a plan to reduce costs by £500m over five years, it said.However Sainsbury's also plans to open around 120 new grocery outlets, mostly convenience stores.The supermarket did not say where the closures would be, but said all Argos staff would be relocated.The plans were announced as Sainsbury's warned investors profits had dipped over the last six months.It blamed bad weather and higher marketing costs for the forecast £50m drop on the period last year.Sainsbury's has been under pressure to show that its business is on track after the collapse of its plan to merge with Asda.Overhauling its large store estate is part of the new plan.It was clear when Sainsbury's bought Argos in 2016 that hundreds of Argos stores would be closed and relocated into Sainsbury's stores.This integration is now well underway. There are now some 290 Argos stores inside a Sainsbury's shop - half of these are relocations.Sainsbury's is keen to point out that ultimately, it'll end up with as many as 100 more shops overall, including a net loss of around five supermarkets.There's no detail today on where the openings and closures could be, nor how many roles will be affected, only that it hoped to boost operating profits by £20m a year through the changes.Sainsbury's is now on a mission to cut costs, some £500m, over the next five years. It's got a tricky balancing act ahead as it tries to cut prices to fend off the discounters and improve its profitability.The supermarket will also cease new mortgage sales as part of a plan to make its financial services division more profitable.Earlier this month, larger rival Tesco sold its entire mortgage portfolio to Halifax, exiting a very competitive market. Low interest rates have made mortgages less profitable for lenders.These moves add weight to the view that offering banking services is becoming a lower priority for the supermarkets, the BBC's personal finance reporter, Kevin Peachey said.""The big grocery stores were often talked of being the main challengers to the established High Street banks, given customers' brand loyalty and an existing ""branch"" network,"" he said.Sainsbury's reported sales for the three months to 21 September for stores open at least a year and excluding fuel dropped 0.2%. Clothing and food sales rose, while household goods sales dropped 2%.A fall in its pension deficit means it can reduce its contributions by £50m a year.""We have focused on reducing prices on every day food and grocery products and expanding our range of value brands, which have been very popular with customers,"" said Chief Executive Mike Coupe. ""At the same time, we are investing significantly in our supermarkets.""Fewer items on promotion and fewer new video game and toy releases hurt sales at Argos, he said, while Sainsbury's Tu brand of clothing performed well.Sainsbury's has been under pressure to come up with a ""plan B"" after its failed attempt to buy Asda earlier this year. It had argued the tie-up was necessary to cut costs and improve its buying power so it could reduce prices to counter the rise of the discounters.Mr Coupe told investors that Sainsbury's could thrive on its own and the reorganisation represented a continuation of his existing strategy with a ""few tweaks"" along the way.""We're more competitive than we've ever been,"" Mr Coupe said.""We are confident in our ability to sustainably fund investment in the customer offer.""Sainsbury's is hoping to generate an extra £20m a year in operating profit with the overhaul of its store estate.New convenience stores will be more targeted to what shoppers want, it said. For instance, in London and other city centre locations, outlets will have more ""food-to-go"".It also wants to open around ten larger convenience stores, containing Argos services, in more suburban locations.Sainsbury's has been cutting prices on some daily essentials as well as launching new budget brands , like J James meat, fish and poultry, as they try to match the success of Asda and Tesco's new own-brand ranges."
business	Tesco profits jump 'in uncertain market'		"Profits at Tesco have jumped 28% in what the UK's biggest supermarket chain described as an ""uncertain"" market.Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group was on track to meet the ""vast majority"" of the turnaround goals he set when he was appointed four years ago after an accounting scandal.The group said its performance was ""strong"", and Tesco has almost doubled its dividend.Full-year pre-tax profits were £1.7bn, with Tesco's same store sales up 1.7%.""After four years we have met, or are about to meet, the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I'm very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/2020,"" said Mr Lewis, who oversaw the takeover of wholesaler Booker in 2017.""I'm delighted with the broad-based improvement across the business,"" he said.Overall like-for-like sales (which strip out changes to stores) rose 2.9%, including the 1.7% at Tesco and 11.1% for Booker. Group sales fell in Asia.Jobs have been lost as he aims to save £1.5bn a year and up to 9,000 roles were put at risk in January when the chain announced it would close food counters in 90 stores.He has also launched a discount chain, Jack's, to take on German rivals Aldi and Lidl, which Tesco said had received a ""strong response"" in the eight new stores.The proposed tie-up between Sainsbury's and Asda, which is currently being investigated by the competition authorities, could further change the landscape, said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor.""External threats are also putting pressure on the retailer with continued uncertainty due to Brexit and the turbulent High Street conditions, evidenced by its decision to cut up to 9,000 jobs by shutting the fresh food counters at 90 stores.""With Marks & Spencer's tie up with Ocado and Amazon's new grocery arm, Amazon Fresh, Dave Lewis will be wary of standing still and instead will want to keep moving,"" she said.The chain said it would set out some ""untapped value opportunities"" at a presentation in June.Booker ""bulk buys"" are already being offered in 70 Tesco stores and will be expanded this year, while Jack's will also be expanded.Mr Lewis has previously said that in the lead-up to Brexit Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up.As he presented the results on Wednesday, he said Tesco had been building stock of ""non-perishable"" goods such as canned food ahead of a possible no-deal exit from the European Union.But he added Tesco had not seen any ""discernible change in behaviour"" from customers during the period of Brexit uncertainty, with no evidence of stockpiling from customers.Mr Lewis said that Tesco's stockpiling was a ""sensible provision"" but that he hoped a no deal exit would not happen.The shares rose 2% in early trading while the dividend is increasing to 5.77p a share from 3p the previous year."
business	M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up	'Good progress'	"Marks & Spencer has reported a fall in both sales and profits as it continues to implement a major turnaround programme.Pre-tax profits were down by nearly 10% in the year to 31 March, at £523.2m.Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down by 2.9% for the group as a whole.Boss Steve Rowe said the firm was making ""good progress"" and judging itself as much on the ""pace of change"" as by the trading outcomes.The retailer, which has 1,043 stores, is part of the way though a big store closure programme.Like-for-like sales in its food halls fell by 2.3%, although M&S said this was affected by the timing of Easter.Clothing and home sales were 1.6% lower, dented by the timing of Easter and poor stock availability, while UK like-for-like sales were down by 2%.Total sales were 3.6% lower because of the store closures.Mr Rowe said: ""We are deep into the first phase of our transformation programme and continue to make good progress restoring the basics and fixing many of the legacy issues we face.""As I have said, at this stage, we are judging ourselves as much by the pace of change as by the trading outcomes and change will accelerate in the year ahead.""However, he added that although there had been ""green shoots"", the retailer had ""not been consistent in our delivery"" in a number of areas.""M&S is changing faster than at any time in my career - substantial changes across the business to our processes, ranges and operations - and this has constrained this year's performance, particularly in clothing and home.""However, we remain on track with our transformation and are now well on the road to making M&S special again.""In May 2018, M&S announced it would close more than 100 clothing and home stores by 2022, of which 85 are still open.In the last financial year, it closed 35 stores as part of its shake-up and opened 48. Between now and 2024, it expects to close another 85 and open 20.In these latest results, the company revealed it now also plans to close 25 smaller, low-volume, high-cost food stores and open 75 new and bigger food outlets.M&S said it had made ""good progress"" on cost savings during the last financial year, which were about £100m, in addition to the operating costs of stores which had closed.In February, it announced a joint venture with Ocado to start home delivery next year, which it said was a ""strategically compelling route to unlock profitable growth for M&S Food"".Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The results give proof, if it were needed, that M&S required a significant shot in the arm to give it relevance in the modern day.""He added that there were ""also positive signs as M&S transforms apace"".""If there were a real requirement for M&S, however, it would be to consolidate its food offering, while strengthening its online presence to give it security and relevance in the new digital age. The Ocado deal could provide that answer.""M&S had given guidance that at least 100 clothing and home stores would go by 2022. It mentioned a figure of about 110 this time last year.Now it's provided a bit more detail: the numbers now add up to potentially 120 closures by 2023-24.It amounts to a 25% reduction in net clothing and home space overall as it tries to modernise its business.The most eye-catching announcement is its plan to open 75 new food stores.At the moment, only about a dozen sites offer shoppers the chance to buy the full range of M&S Food, some 6,500 to 7,000 products.M&S food has always been seen as upmarket and a bit of a treat. The M&S boss wants to broaden its appeal and become more relevant to a family-based customer. The new stores will have parking, for instance.It means 25 smaller Simply Food stores will either close or be relocated in the process.Next year, M&S is starting a partnership with online grocer Ocado to provide a home delivery service.There's an awful lot riding on this expensive tie-up.With this push into bigger and better food stores as well, M&S is making a play for a larger slice of the grocery market."
business	Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon'	Stock market flotationFlotation delayTiming'Desert Davos'	"The stock market flotation of one of the world's most profitable firms is coming ""soon"", the Saudi energy minister has said.Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the decision on when to list Aramco rested with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The energy minister was giving a speech at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.Last year's event was overshadowed by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This led to dozens of Western leaders and executives boycotting the gathering last year.But on Tuesday, the bosses of HSBC, Blackstone, BlackRock, Colony Capital and Evercore were among the crowd at the Ritz Carlton luxury hotel.Less than 24 months ago the same hotel served as one of the detention centres for more than 200 businessmen, ministers and princes during a corruption purge that unnerved investors.Aramco intends to start the listing process on 3 November, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.The firm is considering floating a 1% to 2% stake on Saudi Arabia's Tadawul market, in what would be one of the largest ever public offerings, the news agency said.Aramco said on Tuesday it ""does not comment on rumour or speculation.""""The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders' choosing,"" it said.On Wednesday, Prince Abdulaziz said: ""It [the Aramco flotation] is going to come soon... but it will come at the right time with the right approach and definitely with the right decision.""And it will be a Saudi decision first and foremost.""Specifically, Prince Mohammed's decision.""Aramco's stock market listing was delayed earlier this month in part after difficulties attracting big investors. Its initial public offering has had several false starts.Crown Prince Mohammed, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, wants a valuation of $2tn (£1.55tn) for the firm.However, bankers have put the valuation at between $1.2tn and $1.5tn.Some investors are concerned about the future for oil prices which, while fluctuating wildly, have fallen over the past five years due to stable demand and oversupply.In addition, markets were shaken by drone attacks on 14 September which initially halved Aramco's output.Some foreign investors have been wary of putting money into Saudi Arabia due to concern over its human rights record and the commercial viability of some projects.But attendees on Tuesday said the turnout was impressive and reflected reforms to modernise the largest Arab economy.Prince Mohammed in 2016 launched a plan to transform the economy of the world's largest crude exporter in part by developing non-energy industries.But state oil giant Aramco remains a big draw for some investors.Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said on Tuesday that Aramco will start investor subscription on 4 December, citing sources.The transaction price will be announced on 17 November, and Aramco will start trading on 11 December, the broadcaster reported.Crown Prince Mohammed first flagged the prospect of an Aramco flotation three years ago.Saudi Arabia has attracted high-profile business and political figures to its ""Davos in the Desert"" event, including some who stayed away last year over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.On 2 October 2018 Mr Khashoggi, a journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who led an investigation into his death, concluded that the State of Saudi Arabia was responsible for a ""premeditated extrajudicial execution"".The investor event, under way in Riyadh, features US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who pulled out last time.Mr Mnuchin said the Aramco listing will be a ""great opportunity for developing Saudi capital markets"".In 2017 Donald Trump made a pitch for Aramco to be listed in America, saying it was ""important"" to the US.Others who have changed their minds about staying away from the conference include the bosses of Credit Suisse, Blackstone and BlackRock.HSBC's John Flint dropped out in 2018, but interim boss Noel Quinn is there.The event, officially known as the Future Investment Initiative, is being held for the third time and is viewed as the kingdom's key annual investment event.It is organised by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and despite its nickname, has no connection with the World Economic Forum's annual event in the Swiss resort of Davos."
business	Snapchat-owner beats forecasts as user numbers stabilise	Younger appeal	"The number of Snapchat users has stabilised after two quarters of decline according to its parent company's latest results.Snap said the platform had 186 million daily active users in the three months to 31 December.The number is unchanged from the previous quarter but analysts had expected users to fall.Revenues also rose by more than expected and Snap's losses narrowed for the period.Snap's share price surged more than 15% in after-hours trading.Fourth quarter revenue rose by 36% to $389.8m and losses narrowed to $191.7m from $350m in the comparable period.However, its shares are far below the $27 price they fetched after floating on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2017.Snap, which started in 2012, is known for its appeal to younger users.It was once viewed as one of the most promising names in technology, but investors had soured on its prospects after a series of company stumbles, including a redesign that alienated some users.Last year, the number of daily active users fell to 186 million from a peak of 191 million in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Snap said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" that its user count would hold steady in coming monthsSnap's chief executive Evan Spiegel also defended the redesign, saying it had positioned the company for future growth.He said it would allow the firm to expand the kind of content it offers users, while retaining its emphasis on communication between friends.For the full year, Snap's revenue rose by 43% to more than $1.1bn. Losses were $1.2bn, down from $3.4bn in the previous period.Mr Spiegel said the company was getting ""substantially closer"" to profitability.""We are proud of the progress we have made as we enter 2019 focused on growing our business and driving towards profitability,"" he said."
business	Wetherspoon's profits plunge by 19%		"Profits at UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon fell 19% in the six months to the end of January.It blamed a rise in labour costs, interest payments, utility bills, repairs and depreciation for the fall.Its chairman, Brexit supporter Tim Martin, who generally accompanies results announcements with his colourful opinions, expressed concern that Brexit would be reversed.This, he said, would have ""adverse economic consequences"".He blamed ""the establishment"" for a ""barrage of negative economic forecasts"".Mr Martin is currently touring 100 of his 900 pubs, talking to punters about the merits of leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.The company, which also owns pubs in Ireland, is replacing champagne and prosecco with non-European Union sparkling wines.There has also been a switch in the beers available. Wheat beer and alcohol-free beer from the UK are replacing beers brewed in Germany.Although profits fell sharply, sales at the chain are continuing to rise.Wetherspoon's revenues rose by 7%, and like-for-like sales by more than 6%.Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, said the industry as a whole was struggling: ""The wafer-thin margins within the industry are susceptible to any spike in costs, which leaves the pubs vulnerable from an investment perspective."""

Earnings per share rose 40% to 21 cents.HSBC has moved to rein in spending while trying to boost investment in retail banking and wealth management.""These are an encouraging set of results, particularly in the context of heightened economic uncertainty globally,"" said Mr Flint.The bank's US business continued to disappoint, but saw a return to profit, bringing in $379m, compared with a pre-tax loss of $596m in the first three months of 2018.The bank said its ""US turnaround"" was progressing, but remained its ""most challenging strategic priority"".Earlier this year, HSBC warned profits would be hit by a slowdown in China.In 2018, the lender said it would invest up to $17bn over three years in areas including in China and technology, without affecting profitability."
business	Galliford Try shares drop on profit warning		"Shares in construction firm Galliford Try fell 20% at the start of trading after the firm issued a profit warning.The company, whose activities include housebuilding and road bypasses, said profits will be £30-40m lower than the expected £156m, as it plans to shrink the size of its construction business.It said the biggest chunk related to the Queensferry Crossing, which recently raised final cost estimates.It says it plans to concentrate on areas where it has a successful record.The group was hit last year after one of its partners on the Aberdeen bypass, outsourcing giant Carillion, collapsed, leaving it with extra costs of £38m.It has continued work on that much-delayed and over-budget road scheme with its other partner, Balfour Beatty.Galliford said that cost was not being revised.It said its review would assess both the progress and contract positions throughout the rest of Galliford's construction business.But it added that the majority of its construction businesses ""continued to perform well"".The firm recently promoted its former finance director, Graham Prothero, to chief executive.The company said it would have its verdict ready in the next few weeks and would ""share the detail of the review"", along with a further update on group trading, in its scheduled statement on 21 May."
business	Opel boss 'vows to regain profitability'	Investment funds	"The boss of carmakers Opel and Vauxhall has vowed to ""work aggressively"" to make the brands profitable.""We are talking to every stakeholder right now to improve the business in order to provide sustainable profitability,"" chief executive Karl Stracke told BBC News.Fears are growing that his cost-cutting plan will involve the closure of at least one factory in Europe.He declined to offer any assurance to workers in the UK or Germany.Industry observers have said Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in the UK and Opel's Bochum factory in Germany are likely candidates if Mr Stracke decides to close one plant.The fears grew after last month's revelation that Opel/Vauxhall suffered massive losses last year.Mr Stracke was eager to stress that some 11bn euros ($14.5bn; £9.2bn) is being invested in new products, with some 30 new Opel and Vauxhall models scheduled for launch over the next three years.This should help the company gain market share and grow, he said.Opel/Vauxhall's electric Ampera, which comes with a petrol engine to extend its range, is among the carmakers' most innovative products.The Ampera was named Car of the Year at the Geneva motor show on Monday.Opel and its UK subsidiary Vauxhall are owned by the US automotive giant General Motors."
business	Goals Soccer Centres says accounts crisis stretches back to 2010	Deadline missed	"Goals Soccer Centres , which runs outdoor football centres in the UK, has uncovered ""improper behaviour"" in the preparation of its financial accounts stretching back to 2010 ""at least"".The firm has blamed ""a number of individuals"" for the behaviour.Following the revelations, the company's shares are set to be kicked off the stock exchange.The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who owns a 19% stake in the firm.Goals said that, as the issues with the accounts stretch back nearly a decade, there was ""material uncertainty"" surrounding its historical financial statements.Dealing in the firm's shares was suspended in March when Goals revealed that ""substantial"" VAT errors were likely to cost it £12m.At the time, it said the blunder ""may have an impact on future profitability"", and it delayed the publication of its financial results for last year as it worked to revise them.It had until the end of September to release those results but now it expects to miss that deadline.""The directors do not now believe this timeframe for the audit is achievable,"" the firm told shareholders.As a result Goals no longer expects its shares to resume trading. The listing of its shares on the AIM market is ""expected to cease and cancellation will be effective from 30 September 2019"".Goals, which has 45 pitches in the UK, said conversations were continuing with HMRC over its tax bill but revealed there had been ""no material developments"" in those talks.Nevertheless, it said UK sales had increased over 11% so far this year.

business	RBS warns of Brexit uncertainty impact as profits fall		"RBS has reported a drop in profits for the first three months of the year and warned of the continuing impact of Brexit uncertainty on near-term growth.The bank, which is 62% government-owned, reported £707m profit, down from £808m for the same period last year.It said Brexit uncertainty could delay business borrowing decisions and ""is likely to make income growth more challenging in the near term"".The fall in profit comes a day after chief executive Ross McEwan resigned.He will remain in the role until a successor has been appointed.Alison Rose, who was recently promoted to deputy chief executive of the bank, has been tipped as the leading internal candidate to take over from Mr McEwan.Tougher competition in the mortgage market hit the bank's profit margins in the first quarter. Its investment bank also performed badly over the period, with income down 41.4% on the previous year.""This is a solid set of results set against a highly uncertain and competitive backdrop,"" said Mr McEwan.""We continue to support our customers through this Brexit uncertainty while investing and innovating in digital services to meet rapidly changing customer needs.""RBS shed £45m in costs over the quarter and is on track to take £300m out of the group by the end of the financial year.It said almost three quarters of its current account customers were now regular digital users.The bank has been majority-owned by the government since it received a £45bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008."
business	Boeing uncertain how 737 crashes will hit profits		"Boeing has said it still does not know how the crisis over the safety of its 737 Max 8 jets will affect its profits.In its latest set of results, Boeing said that uncertainty over when the plane would be allowed to fly again meant it could not forecast profits for this year.A fall in 737 deliveries has already led to a $1bn drop in revenues.In March, a Max 8 belonging to Ethiopian Airlines crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew.It was the second crash involving a Max 8 jet in five months. The two disasters prompted aviation regulators round the world to ground the aircraft.""Due to the uncertainty of the timing and conditions surrounding return to service of the 737 Max fleet, new guidance [on profits] will be issued at a future date,"" Boeing said in its first quarter results.Boeing is temporarily cutting production of the 737 airliner from 52 planes a month to 42 from this month.Despite the drop in production Boeing has not laid off staff and is maintaining order levels with many suppliers, all of which is keeping costs high. Meanwhile, some 50 deliveries of new 737 Max planes have been withdrawn.The worldwide fleet of 737 Max planes totalled 387 aircraft at the time of the grounding.Boeing is developing new software for the jet's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an anti-stall system which has come under scrutiny since the crashes.It said last week it was making ""steady progress"" on the path to certifying a software update which had been put through 135 test and production flights.Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said: ""We have great confidence in the update of the software and with the test flights that have occurred. I have personally been on two of those flights and I have seen the confidence that the team has in the system.""Boeing said on Wednesday it expects a certification flight with the US Federal Aviation Administration in the ""near term"".Boeing's commercial aircraft division managed to offset the impact of the Max 8 groundings by increasing production of its 787 planes from 12 a month to 14. Even so, the division still saw a 9% fall in revenue to $11.8bn from $12.9bn.Boeing's net earnings in the first three months of the year were 13% lower at $2.15bn, reflecting a one-third drop in deliveries of the Max 8."
business	Cricket World Cup is about 'participation not profit'	Global TV dealsSharing the spoils'Fantastic format''Upsets and dramas'	"Twenty years ago Steve Elworthy was part of a talented South African cricket team that crashed out of a World Cup semi-final in the most dramatic fashion possible.As the game reached its climax, the team known as The Proteas needed just one run from four balls to reach the tournament final against Pakistan at Lord's.But, on the verge of glory, batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald contrived to get the latter run out in a shambolically exciting end to the game.Two decades on, 54-year-old Elworthy is now the person in charge of staging this year's International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup in England and Wales.And with 50 days until the tournament begins, he says he would welcome such memorable drama at this year's event, even though the pain of that game at Edgbaston, Birmingham, still remains.""I can still remember it as though it was yesterday,"" he says. ""I was in the changing room, in my pads, having been run out myself not long before, when I saw it all unfold on a TV in the changing rooms.""The whole thing happened in slow motion. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.""The changing room was deadly afterwards. There was complete silence for 30 to 40 minutes before we started to gather ourselves. Yet we still got a hero's welcome when we returned to South Africa, despite what had happened.""While the drama, and climactic endings, of one-day cricket remains - just look at the 2017 Women's World Cup final that England won by just nine runs - much has changed in the wider world since the 1999 men's tournament.Elworthy has now organised half a dozen global cricketing events for the ICC, and is putting the finishing touches to this year's World Cup. Lasting for six weeks, it will feature stars such as India's Virat Koli, England's Joe Root, and the West Indies' Chris Gayle.And while this year's event may not make money, Elworthy, says that - given the publicity that will come from wide-ranging global TV deals and over-subscribed ticket sales - making a profit is not the over-riding objective.Rather it is about ensuring cricket remains on the 21st Century sporting and leisure map, at a time when football dominates the back pages, and the power of digital communications means there are competing attractions for people's free time.""This will be my sixth ICC tournament,"" says Elworthy, managing director of the 2019 World Cup. ""They have tended to be short-sharp tournaments with not a lot of legacy, which is something we want to address this year.""He heads up a team of 100 people, based at Lord's Cricket Ground, working to deliver the ICC's global event on behalf of the hosts, the England and Wales Cricket Board.""When we started to plan for this year back in 2014 we realised there was an opportunity for this Cricket World Cup to get more people to play the game,"" he says.""That became the priority for the event hosts, the ECB, and tournament organisers, the ICC. Clearly there are financial benefits, although it is not our priority,"" he points out.He says the event will have a global TV audience of 1.5 billion viewers. There have also been more than three million applicants for just over 650,000 tickets.The ICC keeps broadcast and sponsor revenues, and the ECB keeps publications and ticket revenues - but has pledged to put the money back into the game - to schools and clubs, and into the tournament itself. Meanwhile, the match venues keep hospitality, food, drink, and car parking revenues.The match venues can use that cash to update facilities, such as investing in changing rooms and new floodlights.""We want to engage one million under-16s through the Cricket World Cup,"" says Elworthy. ""It is a hugely ambitious number. We want to really stretch the ICC and ECB to achieve that number.""We want to get 100,000 young people to watch a World Cup game, and have priced tickets for them at £6 a time.""That for me is the main legacy... how to engage with new cricket audiences, and get people to play the games in schools and elsewhere, as well as to watch it.""A volunteer programme, along the lines of that successfully used in London 2012 Olympics and Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, was heavily oversubscribed.The World Cup will also be used to publicise the ECB's All Stars Cricket programme, aimed at giving children aged five to eight a first experience in cricket.There has been much debate around the tournament format, which instead of a number of groups, features one large group, with each of the 10 teams playing each other once, before two semi finals and a final.""The 1992 World Cup, where there was a round-robin format, was heralded as one of the better ones,"" says Elworthy.""I think all-playing-all is the best format. Every supporter knows where their team is going to play and when. If you have different pools you have uncertainty and fans buying tickets 'on spec' for future games they might not qualify for. The round-robin format has been terrific for us in terms of ticket sales.""Every team is guaranteed nine games. You could have a bad result and your prospects change, and suddenly you have to perform to get into the top four and a semi-final place. Or you could have a good few result, and the semi-final is a possibility again.""With such a demand for tickets and only a finite amount available, that plays into the hands of touts.""We are doing what we can about it within the confines of the law,"" says Elworthy. ""We are very pro-active in this areas. We have our own ticket resale platform in place.""He said if organisers were able to identify the seat row and number of tickets appearing on non-sanctioned secondary websites, then they would cancel them.""There is a very real danger you will not be able to get into games,"" he warns. ""We priced tickets at a certain level for a reason, with the lowest price being £16. We want the tournament to be accessible.""We want to attract families, with fan zones and lots of interactive and participatory events around games.""Looking back to 1999 does he believe there will be anything to compare to that semi final, when South Africa and Australia actually tied the match, but the latter went through after finishing higher in their earlier Super Six table?""There are bound to be upsets and drama,"" he says. ""The different playing conditions from the north to the south of the country will play a part too."""
business	Energy firms dispute Ofgem profitability figures	Rising billsSingle figureAnalysisWholesale markets	"Energy suppliers have criticised figures from their regulator, showing that their profitability has soared.Ofgem said that the profit margin for energy firms had risen to £125 per customer per year, from £15 in June, but suppliers said that was misleading.The figure is a snapshot of how much suppliers would make from dual-fuel customers if energy prices and bills stayed unchanged for the next year.Ofgem also said it would force suppliers to simplify tariffs.""A snapshot of profits every few months does not provide a realistic picture of the average profits over a year of companies in the sector,"" said Christine McGourty, director of Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers.""It is the rising cost of wholesale energy that has contributed to the increase in customers' bills this year.""The profit margin has risen because, since June, the providers have raised prices by more than the increase in wholesale energy costs.However, Ofgem predicts that energy firms' profit margins will fall to about £90 per customer next year as wholesale prices continue to rise.The profit margin is a volatile measure, and indeed showed the providers losing money for much of the time from 2004 to 2009.""The approach adopted by Ofgem in calculating this figure is entirely theoretical and does not reflect how a responsible energy supply business manages its energy procurement strategy in reality,"" said SSE, which estimates its profit margin at £62 per customer.British Gas said it had made £24 after tax per dual-fuel household. It said that Ofgem's methodology was ""flawed excluding, as it does, the discounts we give our customers and the benefits they receive from fixed price contracts, as well as understating our commodity costs"".But Ofgem said that the suppliers were ""comparing apples with pears"" and expressed concern about the transparency of the accounts from which suppliers have taken their own profit figures.In addition to the profit figures, Ofgem also published its simplification plan, under which suppliers would be forced to have no-frills tariffs. These would consist of a standing charge - fixed by the regulator - plus a unit charge for energy used.By Damian KahyaBusiness reporter, BBC NewsIn addition to the new simple tariffs, companies will still be allowed to offer an almost infinite range of fixed rate deals, similar to mobile phone contracts.Though complex, those deals may end up cheaper than a standard rate, especially if they are tied to the planned roll out of smart meters.These complicated deals may also offer greater savings to households that can afford special devices designed to use more electricity when the price is low.It's exactly that type of complexity which has put many lower income households off switching to cheaper tariffs, a problem Ofgem is trying to solve.The coming consultation will give the regulator a chance to see if it can be fixed, perhaps by making all tariffs - even smart meter deals - directly comparable on the same terms.Q&A: Plans to simplify energy tariffsIt means that the only number consumers would have to compare between suppliers would be the unit energy charge.""The process of trying to switch from one supplier to another is hideously complicated - very off-putting even for quite intelligent people,"" Tim Yeo MP, chair of the Energy and Climate Change Committee told the BBC.He also criticised the rise in profit margins to a three-year-high as, ""evidence of absolutely crass behaviour by the energy companies, with a jump in prices announced in the last few months ahead of what will be a winter in which most families face their highest ever electricity and gas bills"".Under Ofgem's simplification plan, more complicated tariffs would still be available, but they would have to be for a fixed period, with price increases not being allowed for the duration of the deal.The regulator will publish its detailed proposals for consultation next month and hopes to have implemented some of its reforms in time for winter 2012.The average dual-fuel bill is now £1,345 a year following recent price rises from all the big suppliers.""When consumers face energy bills at around £1,345 they must have complete confidence that this price is set by companies competing in a fully competitive market,"" said Ofgem's chief executive Alistair Buchanan.""At the moment that is not the case.""Energy UK said the industry was already working on improving the situation.""Companies are already looking closely at the structure of tariffs and at the information provided on bills and are developing ways of making them easier for people to understand and compare so that people can ensure they are on the best deal for them,"" said Ms McGourty of Energy UK.""People who are worried about bills this winter may be able to save money by switching to pay by direct debit or shopping around, especially if they have never switched before.""In addition to trying to boost competition by simplifying tariffs, Ofgem is looking at how to reform the wholesale energy markets, which are the places suppliers go to buy their energy.Ofgem wants to reform those markets to allow greater competition with the big suppliers and will publish proposals in December.The bigger suppliers have an advantage because they generate their own power, selling most of it to consumers, with little of it going to wholesale markets.But earlier in the week one of the big providers, SSE, announced plans to auction all of its power on the open market.Ofgem has proposed that utilities must auction 20% of their electricity by 2013.Industry bodies and consumer groups have been invited to Westminster on Monday by Energy Secretary Chris Huhne to discuss ways in which consumers can save money on their bills."

business	Jaguar Land Rover gets China sales boost		"Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported a quarterly profit after seeing a big boost to sales in China.The firm made a pre-tax profit of £156m in the three months to 30 September, with revenues up 8% to £6.1bn.Sales in China - a key market for car manufacturers - were up by nearly a quarter from a year earlier.JLR said the popularity of new models helped to lift the results, with global sales of the new Range Rover Evoque up by more than 50%.The strong performance from JLR helped its owner - India's Tata Motors - to report a smaller than expected loss for the quarter.Tata's loss for the quarter narrowed to 2.17bn rupees ($31m; £24m) from 10.49bn rupees a year earlier.In January, JLR confirmed 4,500 job cuts, with the substantial majority coming from its 40,000 strong UK workforce. Those cuts have now been made, a spokeswoman said.Announcing the results, JLR chief executive Sir Ralf Speth said it was ""encouraging to see the impact of our Project Charge transformation programme and our improvement initiatives in the China market start to come through in our results"".In April this year, JLR shut down production for a week because of uncertainties around Brexit.The carmaker also plans to shut down UK factories for a week in November, to adjust production due to uncertainties including Brexit and lower demand for diesel cars, the spokeswoman said.With roughly a fifth of its sales to Europe, the firm has previously called for tariff-free and frictionless trade after Brexit."
business	Uber warns it may not make a profit in IPO documents	'Stronger team'	"Uber, the ride-sharing app and delivery business, has warned it ""may not achieve profitability"" as it finally released details of its plan to float.It will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, in a deal likely to value the US firm at about $100bn (£76.5bn).Uber said that its most recent annual sales rose to $11.2bn and losses narrowed to $3bn.But it also expects operating expenses to ""increase significantly"".The company did not disclose how it will price its shares when it begins selling them to public investors on the stock exchange.However, it has been reported that they may be valued at between $48 and $55 each, potentially giving the 10-year old firm a value of up to $100bn, making it the biggest initial public offering this year.Uber is also expected to raise about $10bn through the flotation.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who replaced Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, said in a letter: ""Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight; built a stronger and more cohesive management team; and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.""When Mr Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive in 2017, the company was struggling to recover from a number of scandals, including a toxic work environment that was exposed by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler.It has also faced numerous legal issues, including whether the people who work for the company are classed as staff and are therefore entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber is one of a number of so-called unicorns - private investor-backed companies worth $1bn or more - that are planning initial public offerings this year.However, there are questions about investor appetite for these companies, which have attracted high valuations in the private market, but are yet to make a profit.Uber's smaller rival, Lyft, was the first of the group to float, but since listing at the end of March, its share price has fallen by 15.2% to $61.Meanwhile, Pinterest, the virtual scrapbook, has priced its shares at between $15 and $17 each, valuing the firm at as much as $11.3bn which is below its $12bn valuation in its most recent private funding round in 2017.Pinterest's listing, which is expected next week, could raise up to $1.2bn in funding for the firm."
business	Asos profits plunge 87% after difficult year	What has gone wrong at Asos?Why has Asos changed its returns policy?How is Asos trying to transform its business?Why is Asos' share price going up?	"Online fashion retailer Asos has seen its profits plunge, after a difficult year caused by heavy discounting and website traffic issues.Asos' pre-tax profits fell 87% to £4m for the six months to 28 February against the same period in 2018.The firm said it had managed to stabilise sales, which rose 14% to £1.3bn for the period.Asos said marketing changes meant a fall in visits to its websites and a drop in its search engine rankings.Asos shares are up 13% in morning trading.Chief executive Nick Beighton said that Asos had identified a number of things it ""can do better"", and that heavy investment in its platforms gave the retailer ""increased confidence"" that its performance would improve in the second half of the year.He added that the global fashion industry was growing and now worth more than £220bn.""We now have the tech platform, the infrastructure, a constant conversation with our growing customer base who love our own great product and the constantly evolving edit of brands we present to them,"" said Mr Beighton.Asos said its financial guidance for the year remained the same.In December, Asos warned on profits, saying that cutting prices to match rivals had not led to a significant increase in sales, sparking a 40% fall in the share price.The profit warning came as a shock to many, as Asos was seen as an online disrupter to the High Street fashion market.""The company's current predicament shows people are simply spending less on goods, be it in physical or virtual shops,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates.Despite the heavy discounting, she feels that Asos is now on the right track, particularly if spending stabilises over the next year.""Asos is still very much a growth story, and its vast customer base, and growing international proposition, mean it should be able to prosper from here on in,"" said Ms Lund-Yates.In early April, Asos announced that it was changing its returns policy.The time allowed for returns of unwanted items has been lengthened from 28 days to 45 days.However, the retailer warned customers that if it suspected that individuals were actually wearing goods and then returning them, or ordering and returning ""loads"", it might deactivate the account.A popular rising trend has seen customers post pictures on social media of themselves in new outfits.Certain users do not like being seen in the same outfit twice, making it tempting to use an outfit once and return it.Asos said that initiatives designed to improve its business had hit profits, from decisions on short-term pricing and inventory, to new marketing strategies.To stay competitive, the retailer launched 200 versions of its website depending on which country the customer is in, which had a negative effect on Asos' search engine rankings.Asos also made changes to the way customers navigate around its main website, particularly in how new products were displayed.Asos said that the changes resulted in a slowdown in the growth of younger customers, but UK sales rose 16% due to orders from existing customers.Although US sales growth was below expectations, the retailer said that demand far exceeded its expectations in February, once its new warehouse in Atlanta went online.Sales rose by 80% in the first three days after the warehouse went into operation, to the extent that Asos did not have enough staff to cope with demand, and there was a delay in sending out packages to customers.According to Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, the price of Asos shares is rising because investors are willing to ""take a bet on the future"".Although the share price hasn't returned to the heights it reached prior to the December profit warning, Asos actually isn't doing that badly. ""Asos is still flying, it's still outperforming the market. It set itself a very high bar previously,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC.""Asos has a lot going for it - if you look at the US, there's huge, huge growth about to happen, I think we saw that with the warehouse problem they had.""That's a great problem to have."""
business	Eurozone gets fresh help to bolster flagging growth	'Serious policy easing'Analysis	"The European Central Bank has unveiled fresh stimulus measures to bolster the eurozone, including cutting a key interest rate.The deposit facility rate, paid by banks on reserves parked at the ECB, was already negative, but has now been cut from minus 0.4% to minus 0.5%.The ECB also said it was re-starting quantitative easing. It will buy €20bn of debt a month from 1 November.The eurozone's main interest rate has remained unchanged at zero.The moves come as the ECB combats an economic slowdown. The bank said its asset purchase programme would ""run for as long as necessary"", while interest rates would remain ""at their present or lower levels"" until eurozone inflation reached its target rate of 2%.Quantitative easing, or QE, is a way for central banks to pump money into the financial system when interest rates are ultra-low and conventional stimulus methods no longer work.The central bank buys assets, usually government bonds, with money it has ""printed"" - or, more accurately, created electronically.Making more money available in this way is supposed to encourage financial institutions to lend more to businesses and individuals.Under its previous QE programme, the ECB bought €2.6 trillion of bonds between 2015 and 2018.ECB chief Mario Draghi told a news conference that the inflation outlook had been further downgraded.""Headline inflation is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year,"" he said.Mr Draghi also announced that the ECB had lowered this year's and next year's GDP growth forecasts for the eurozone. It now expects growth of 1.1% this year and 1.2% in 2020.He said the eurozone was suffering from the ""prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties"".The eurozone's biggest economy, Germany, is widely thought to be on the brink of recession.The ECB's decisions drew a swift reaction from US President Donald Trump, who tweeted that the ECB was ""trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the euro against the VERY strong dollar"".Responding to Mr Trump's comments, Mr Draghi referred to him as ""the First Tweeter"".""We have a mandate, we pursue price stability, and we do not target exchange rates, period,"" he said.Mr Draghi is due to make way for incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde on 1 November.The ECB's main refinancing rate has been at zero since March 2016.""At first glance, the ECB has not quite thrown the kitchen sink at the eurozone economy,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe.""The QE package is shy of market expectations, which were €30bn a month. But the Bank is clearly back in the business of serious policy easing and more aggressive action could easily be taken in response to a worsening in conditions.""By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondentSo the ECB has fired off another volley of its monetary policy ammunition. But will it hit the target? Will it get inflation up towards the ECB's target and will it stimulate the eurozone's flagging economy? Many people are very sceptical.The interest rate move takes us even further into the strange world of negative rates. There is a view that that measure is actually counterproductive, that it has an adverse impact on bank profitability. Perhaps ECB policy more widely has reached the limit of its ability to stimulate economic activity.The other main weapon against economic weakness is in the hands of governments - fiscal policy, or public spending and taxation. For some governments in the eurozone, their scope to use that weapon is constrained by the amount of debt they already have and by eurozone rules. But the likely next head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde has called for more action in that area.Countries such as Germany have strong government finances, but so far have been wary of departing from what they see as prudent financial management. There is, however, a growing debate about what the eurozone needs."
business	Kingfisher boss to go as profits fall further		"The boss of struggling DIY group, Kingfisher, which owns B&Q and Screwfix, is to step down amid worsening profits.Veronique Laury, who had been overseeing a turnaround plan, will leave the company, although no date was given for her departure.Profits fell 13% over the last year, with the firm's French chain, Castorama, dragging down sales.The firm also announced it would close all 19 Screwfix outlets in Germany.It said it was considering the closure of 15 further stores across the group.Kingfisher said Ms Laury would remain at the firm until a successor was found. She has been in the role since December 2014. Her departure will leave only five other female chief executives in the FTSE 100.Ms Laury's turnaround strategy for the group, dubbed ""One Kingfisher"", is set to cost £800m over five years.It involves unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings.However, doubts were raised over Ms Laury's future at the DIY group after sales continued to flag three years into the new strategy. The group's shares have fallen 27% over the last year.Ms Laury said: ""Leading the transformation has been so exciting but also very challenging.""As the transformation approaches its final year, I believe it is right for someone else to lead the next phase of the One Kingfisher journey.""Kingfisher, which also owns the Castorama and Brico Dépôt chains in France, said sales at existing stores, known as like-for-like sales, fell 1.6% over the year, although overall sales were 0.3% up.But while overall sales at B&Q fell 2.8%, the group's other UK-based chain, Screwfix, has performed strongly, with a 10% rise in sales. While B&Q targets home DIY enthusiasts, Screwfix caters to trade customers, such as plumbers and electricians.Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said that while Screwfix's success was down to its specialist trade desks, B&Q was facing a Brexit-related impact on consumer confidence, reducing spending on big purchases.""It's a tough game to be in and perhaps, with the slowdown in the secondary housing market, people are not replacing kitchen and bathroom suites as often,"" he added.Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""The contrast between B&Q's 'stack them high' retail policy and Screwfix's one-to-one service with expert advice from the sales assistants is marked. This approach appears to have created a very loyal customer base.""Brico Dépôt's positive record in France and Poland was offset by the French chain Castorama, which continued to underperform.In November, the firm announced it was pulling out of Russia, Spain and Portugal altogether, as part of the plan to simplify the business.Underlying profit fell 13% to £693m. But when costs including £111m for store closures were included, profits were 52.8% lower for the year to the end of January.Kingfisher said it would continue to expand the Screwfix chain, increasing its store target from 700 to about 800 outlets. The brand will be launched in Ireland this year.Ms Palmer said the results gave ""little hope to investors"", pointing to ""tumultuous market conditions"" and civil unrest in France.""The group will now be facing growing pressure to hold on to its prized assets, B&Q and Screwfix, which have seen vultures circling for some time,"" she added."
business	Next's store sales and profits keep falling	'Comfort''Numb' over Brexit'Advantage'Will we still want shops?	"Next's annual sales and profits at its High Street stores have continued their fall of recent years, while its online business continues to grow.Sales in Next's stores fell nearly 8% last year to £1.95bn, while online sales rose by 14.7% to £1.92bn.It said online was a ""long-term threat"" to its High Street business, but a ""larger opportunity"" for the group.The retailer also said it could see ""no evidence"" that Brexit uncertainty was affecting consumer behaviour.Overall, Next's group pre-tax profits for the year to January were in line with expectations at £722.9m, a fall of 0.4%.Annual profits at its High Street stores fell by just over 20%, while online profits jumped by nearly 14%.Total group sales, including the finance division, rose by 2.5% to £4.22bn.Next said 53% of its sales were now online.It said the growth of online sales ""represents a long-term threat to our retail business but potentially, a much larger opportunity for the group as a whole"".Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the difference between the fortunes of the stores and online was becoming ""increasingly marked"".""The online business, which has long been the jewel in the crown, continues its growth apace with full-price sales increasing nearly 15% over the period.""The fact that there is a slow transition to this channel... is of comfort, even though the additional costs of transferring in the form of warehouse picking and delivery, need to be carefully managed.""Chairman Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit, said the retailer could see ""no evidence"" that Brexit uncertainty was ""affecting consumer behaviour in our sector"".""Our feeling is that there is a level of fatigue around the subject that leaves consumers numb to the daily swings in the political debate.""If the UK government's provisional tariff rates were introduced in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Lord Wolfson said Next had estimated there would be a net reduction in the tariffs it pays of about £12m-£15m, as tariffs on goods imported from outside the EU fell.In the ""medium term"", Next's intention would be to pass on price cuts to customers. ""In the context of £1.7bn of stock purchases, the savings would be relatively modest,"" he added.Julie Palmer, an analyst at Begbies Traynor, said Next ""continues to impress"":""The continuing success of its online and catalogue offering means the retailer has a significant advantage over its competitors, and continued investment in its online offering will guarantee future success.""However it is not all plain sailing for this iconic retailer, with it suffering from a double whammy of falling High Street sales combined with higher staff wages which will continue to impact its financial performance. As such High Street store closures are on the cards in the coming year.""In its results statement, Next spelt out in some detail what it expects to happen to its store portfolio in the coming years.It said its stores were still a ""valuable financial asset and an increasingly important"" part of its online business.It pointed out it costs it less to deliver online orders to stores than to customers' homes and that more than half of online orders were delivered to stores, while more than 80% of returns were through stores.However, in what might be seen as a warning to landlords it said that while retail costs were fixed in the short term, they were ""likely to decline in the longer run"".""We are often asked 'how much less space will you need in the future?' It is the wrong question. We do not have too much space, we have too much rent, rates and service charge.""""The amount of retail space we trade in the future will depend on whether the cost of retail space adequately reflects the reality of retail trading conditions. Our guess is that there will be shops in fifteen years' time, but they will be fewer in number, possibly smaller and MUCH less expensive.""As an example, Next said last year it had negotiated a rent cut of 29% on the leases it renewed.""We experienced a reduction of 25% on leases renewed in the previous year and we expect similar reductions in the year ahead."""
business	Saga shares hit record low on profit alert	Analysis:Brand 'squandered'	"Shares in Saga, the over-50s insurance and holiday specialist, dived almost 40% to hit a record low of 65p after it reported lower profits and warned that earnings would be hit next year.A ""fundamental"" rethink will see Saga make changes to its insurance business that are set to cut profit margins.Saga, which has just over two million customers, also cut the dividend payout to shareholders.The company added it had written down the value of its business by £310m.Saga, which said it faced ""increasing challenges"" in its markets, reported a 5.4% fall in underlying profits to £180m for the year to 31 January.For the current financial year, it is expecting profits to fall to between £105m and £120m.After dropping to 65p, Saga's shares had recovered slightly to 70p by midday on Thursday.Saga's insurance business - along with many other firms in the sector - relied on selling cheap deals to new customers, and rebuilding profits as they renewed their policies.Customers are increasingly using price comparison websites to take out insurance policies, where the price of the product matters more than having a strong brand - effectively ""commoditising"" insurance.However, Saga said it would try to move away from cheap introductory deals, and offer fixed rates for three years.Lance Batchelor, Saga chief executive of Saga, told the BBC: ""Over the past decade our insurance business has been in decline, whereas the other, cruise, side has been flourishing.""We are now making a change to the way we sell insurance, with the launch of our three-year fixed-price offering for home and motoring insurance.""Saga did better in its travel division, where underlying pre-tax profits rose by 2.4% to £21.1m, although it said ""Brexit was putting a clear dampener on customers' willingness to commit to holidays in 2019"".By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondentSaga was seen as having a lucrative hold on older and better off customers happy to stick with a familiar brand, so much so that when it sold its shares in the stock market five years ago, customers bought half of them.Now investors have seen their holdings drop to less than half the original price and the annual dividend cut. Bookings are down for cruises and holidays, with the uncertainty about Brexit getting some of the blame.But the big issue has been insurance. The Saga name counts for less now that people are hunting down the cheapest deals on price comparison websites.And the whole insurance industry is facing a clampdown by the Financial Conduct Authority for charging low prices to start with then pushing up the cost for loyal customers when they renew.Saga is hoping that by introducing new policies offering a steady price for three years it can make a fresh start.Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Saga's turnaround plan for its insurance arm may be ""too little too late"".He added: ""In a market where insurance has become highly commoditised, Saga will need to work hard if it's to create a reason for older drivers to knock directly on its door.""Saga's shares have performed badly. It only joined the stock market in 2014, when its shares were 185p a share. They are now trading well under half that at 67p.Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing's share dealing service, said: ""The company admits that it has got a lot wrong in recent years.""It has squandered its strong brand recognition among its target market of over-50s, trying and failing to compete in a highly competitive and commoditised insurance market when it should have focused instead on what it could do differently.""That's the new approach and investors must hope that after a disastrous start as a publicly-quoted company, the new Saga ends better than the last one."""
business	Housebuilder Persimmon's profits top £1bn	Analysis:	"Profits have topped £1bn for the first time at housebuilder Persimmon, which was caught in a pay row last year and is under scrutiny over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme.Annual profits jumped 13% to £1.091bn, up from £966m in 2017.The firm also said its interim chief executive, Dave Jenkinson, would now take on the role permanently.Mr Jenkinson's predecessor, Jeff Fairburn, left last year following controversy over his £75m pay package.""We are the first company to make over £1bn profit in this sector,"" Mr Jenkinson said. ""The whole team are very proud.""The results come a day after shares in Persimmon fell 5% because of questions over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme.The firm sold 7,970 homes under the scheme in 2018, up from 7,682 in 2017.At the weekend, a source close to Housing Minister James Brokenshire said the minister was ""increasingly concerned"" by Persimmon's practices, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership.He said this meant its inclusion in the Help to Buy scheme was under review.Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, told the BBC that profit per house at Persimmon had trebled since Help To Buy was introduced.And housing expert Henry Pryor told the BBC: ""There is no doubt that Help to Buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. We've all got addicted to it and when we are weaned off it, it is going to be painful.""By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenterThe Persimmon money machine rolls on, profits past the £1bn mark and £2.2bn returned to shareholders in the past seven years, with the promise of more - much more - to come.Persimmon has been an astonishing success for its investors, and of course its executives, who are benefiting from a giant pay scheme agreed in 2012.Sometimes, though, you can have too much success, particularly when you are a big beneficiary of a taxpayer-funded housing scheme, in this case Help to Buy.Jeff Fairburn, the former chief executive, had to fall on his sword after public and investor opinion swung sharply against the size of his remuneration - £75m, although he gave some to charity.The danger now is that a similar shift in sentiment undermines the company as a whole.Politicians might decide that £1bn a year in profits, a 30% operating margin and giant dividends to shareholders are evidence the new-build housing market is no longer sufficiently competitive, and has instead turned into an oligopoly, a market carved up between a few big players.There was a hint of that in weekend reports that Persimmon's participation in Help to Buy was under government scrutiny - a hint strong enough to send the shares down nearly 5%.If the hint were to turn into reality, the Persimmon money machine would judder to a halt.Mr Jenkinson has been with the firm for 22 years and had been interim chief executive since November, following Mr Fairburn's departure.He said: ""2018 has been a year of disciplined high quality growth again for Persimmon Homes.""We have a lower average selling price than our competitors, but that is a function of our desire to hit all parts of the market.""He added: ""It is important for me as the new CEO to acknowledge that we still have work to do in customer care.""Chairman Roger Devlin said: ""Persimmon is changing. In his short time as interim CEO, Dave Jenkinson has introduced new approaches to customer satisfaction and colleague engagement, whilst also ensuring that the group delivered another year of growth.""The company's total group revenue for the year increased by 4% to £3.74bn, up from £3.60bn in 2017.Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Conditions are about as good as they can be, with low interest rates, record low unemployment and helpful government schemes like Help to Buy all helping people get on the property ladder.""With Persimmon's participation in the Help to Buy programme under heavy scrutiny, following its former use of controversial leasing fees, and poor quality builds, these conditions have to end at some point.""Looking ahead, the company said in its results statement: ""Whilst sales expectations remain subject to a degree of uncertainty at the start of any financial year, the lack of clarity with respect to the UK's exit from the EU is currently creating additional unpredictability.""It added: ""We have worked with our suppliers to identify any material supplies which may be exposed to some disruption to availability as a result of Brexit and we are working with them to adopt appropriate mitigating measures."""
business	HSBC profits hit by China slowdown		"HSBC has reported a lower-than-expected 15.9% rise in pre-tax profits for 2018, partly because of an economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong.Europe's largest bank made $19.9bn (£15.4bn) before tax last year, compared with $17.2bn in 2017.Reported revenue was $53.8bn, a rise of 5% from the previous year.HSBC makes three-quarters of its profits in Asia, and China's trade war with the US was one reason for problems with its economy near the end of 2018.Group chairman Mark E Tucker said that the bank was ""in a strong position"".He added: ""Despite a challenging external environment in the fourth quarter, all of our global businesses delivered increased profits.""Last June, new group chief executive John Flint set out eight targets for the bank to achieve, including accelerated growth from Asia and its international network, and growth in its UK customer base.He said the latest results were good and showed that progress had been made towards achieving these goals.Mr Flint added that the bank was ready for Britain's departure from the European Union next month, and said that its operations in France ""gives us a major advantage in this regard"".Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes fund managers, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that he expected a ""modestly negative"" reaction to HSBC's results.""If you look at the bigger picture, HSBC is still an incredibly profitable institution. It is pivoting towards Asia... and that strategy appears to be successful"".Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares Fund, said: ""HSBC has always been a bank built around facilitating international trade between Asia and the rest of the world.""Today's tariff spats between the US and China are hardly helpful and could begin to hurt the group's customers in Asia and beyond.""However, he added that while the results were ""disappointing"", the bank ""can hardly be described as in crisis"".HSBC said it was planning to increase the salaries of its directors by 3.3% this year - which it said was in line with the average for its UK employees. It is the first salary rise for executive directors since 2011.The bank is also asking shareholders to approve a new pay policy for its directors at April's annual general meeting."
business	Quiz shares halve on fresh profit alert		"Shares in women's fashion retailer Quiz have halved after the company issued another profit warning following a ""significant shortfall"" in sales.Sales at the company's 240 UK stores and concessions fell 11.1% in the first two months of the year.,Quiz chief executive Tarak Ramzan said ""all aspects of the business"" were being reviewed.Full-year profits are set to be £4.5m, verses £8.2m expected previously.It made that previous estimate in January, when it downgraded its forecast of £11.5m made in October.It shares - which were listed in July 2018 - fell 50% to 15p after the latest profits warning. They have fallen sharply since October's update, when they were trading at close to 150p.Mr Ramzan said: ""Whilst the board remains confident in the strength and appeal of the Quiz brand, as demonstrated by our continued sales growth online, this has been a highly disappointing trading period for the group"".The warning comes at a time when a number of retailers are facing falling sales on the High Street.Quiz said that while online revenue had increased by 16.2% in the trading period after Christmas, this failed to make up for the fall in High Street sales. This meant revenue for the trading period was down 1.7% on the same time last year.Based in Glasgow, Quiz was founded in 1993. It currently has 71 stores in the UK and 169 concessions, most of which are in the struggling House of Fraser and Debenhams department store chains.It also has outlets in the Republic of Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Cyprus, Egypt, Georgia and Pakistan. It says it ""focuses on delivering catwalk style looks and all the latest trends at value for money prices"" for 16 to 35-year-olds.Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, said sales would have been hit as consumers would have been buying ""going out"" items - the focus for Quiz - during the quieter months of January and February.""This coupled with shoppers generally holding back spend in uncertain economic times, has led to a steep sales decline,"" she said.Quiz said its profits had not only been hit by falling sales, but also by the need sell-off clothing at cheaper prices.It had based its previous forecasts for profits on a 9.2% rise in sales in the last quarter of the year. But it now said the fall in sales and the ""increased level of discounting"" had forced it reduce its expectations for profits."

In 2017 Sports Direct shareholders rejected a proposed £11m payment to the Mr Ashley's brother, John, and these accounts say that the contract with his business Barlin is ""no longer in place"".But a business controlled by Michael Murray, the fiance of one of Mr Ashley's daughters, continues to provide ""property consultancy services"" to Sports Direct.The accounts also show that the company has looked at the role of Justin Barnes, a director of ISBL Consultancy which has a ""commercial relationship"" with Sports Direct. This was deemed to be an ""advisory capacity"" role and not one involving any management function, the accounts state."
business	Debenhams in profit alert as sales continue to slide	Analysis	"Struggling department store chain Debenhams has issued another profit warning as its sales continue to fall.In a trading update, the retailer said the forecast it made on 10 January, when it said full-year profits were set to hit analysts' expectations of about £8.2m, was ""no longer valid"".Like-for-like sales at the firm for the 26 weeks to 2 March were down 5.3%.Debenhams said talks with stakeholders to put it on a firmer footing were ""continuing constructively"".The retailer, which issued three profit warnings last year, said it would provide a further update with its interim results statement.Sergio Bucher, the chief executive of Debenhams, said: ""We are making good progress with our stakeholder discussions to put the business on a firm footing for the future.""We still expect that this process will lead to around 50 stores closing in the medium term.""He said the business would need the help of landlords and local authorities to address rent and rate levels and lease commitments.Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenterOddly timed announcements to the stock exchange normally do not contain good news - a market maxim that Debenhams, the beleaguered department store chain, proved this morning.Companies generally make their statements at 7am on the dot, exactly an hour before the start of trading.Debenhams made this morning's announcement 45 minutes later, giving the impression that the statement had to be rushed out.There is a profit warning - perhaps not that much of a surprise given the uncertainty surrounding the company, and the bleak trading conditions across the High Street - but there is also a coded admission that the company is looking in earnest at a sweeping financial restructuring - a debt-for-equity swap, where shareholders are wiped out and lenders take control, or a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that lets a company get rid of unwanted liabilities such as pensions and long-term leases.Of the two, the latter is more likely; Debenhams' equity - the total value of the shares listed on the London exchange - is just £36m.A month ago, the department store chain said it had been granted a cash injection of £40m to buy it extra time as it battled to secure a longer-term deal with lenders.At the time, the company called it a ""first step"" towards a sustainable future.It is also reportedly trying to accelerate plans to close stores and is expected to close around 20 outlets this year.High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less.Laith Khalaf, from stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Debenhams' future is hanging in the balance, and with short sellers circling too [share traders who believe the shares have further to fall], we can expect share price movements to be volatile.""The department store needs to stage a Lazarus-like recovery to turn things around from here.""Debenhams - which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people - reported a record pre-tax loss of £491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas.Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought its assets for £90m.Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Group to vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board.Mr Bucher is chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board."
business	Norwegian cuts routes over 737 Max grounding	Rapid growth	"Budget airline Norwegian Air has said it will end flights between Ireland and the US next month, blaming the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max.""We have concluded these routes are no longer commercially viable,"" it said.Norwegian, which has struggled to make a profit, said last month the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane could undo its plan to return to profitability.Norwegian said all six routes from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the US and Canada would end on 15 September.Boeing's 737 Max fleet was grounded after two fatal crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March.In total 346 people were killed.""Since March, we have tirelessly sought to minimise the impact on our customers by hiring replacement aircraft to operate services between Ireland and North America. However, as the return to service date for the 737 Max remains uncertain, this solution is unsustainable,"" said Matthew Wood, senior vice president of Norwegian's long-haul division.The airline said any customers who already had flights booked would be rerouted onto other Norwegian services.If passengers no longer wanted to travel with the airline, Norwegian said they would be offered a full refund.""We will continue to offer scheduled services from Dublin to Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen as normal,"" said Mr Wood.The airline said any redundancies resulting from the decision to end the Ireland-US routes would be ""a last resort"".""Our 80 Dublin-based administrative staff at Norwegian Air International and Norwegian Group's asset company, Arctic Aviation Assets, will not be affected by the route closures,"" Mr Wood added.Norwegian Air was founded in 1993 as a small domestic airline, but changed strategy in 2002 to become a budget carrier.Its low fares have helped it grow rapidly, and it is now Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier.Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff.Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport.It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa, according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.However, that growth has come at the expense of profits.The airline lost 1.45bn kroner (£135m) last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft.In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft."
business	Superdry founder promises revival after £85m loss		"Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton says he is trying to ""steady the ship"" after the fashion retailer reported an £85m annual loss.Mr Dunkerton returned to the firm in April, after a lengthy campaign against the previous management, who he said had a ""misguided"" strategy.As well as reporting a steep loss for last year, Superdry warned that sales could fall in the current financial year.In 2018 it reported profits of £65.3m.""My first priority on returning to Superdry has been to steady the ship and get the culture of the business back to the one which drove its original success,"" Mr Dunkerton said.He said he planned to return the brand to its ""design-led roots"", paving the way for a return to profitability over the next three years.Customers will be offered greater choice in stores and online, he said.There will be less discounting, a website redesign and a change in marketing strategy as part of the new strategy.The firm will aim to renegotiate better terms with landlords, as a large proportion of its leases come up for renewal over the next two years, he added.However there could also be a ""minimal"" number of store closures in the UK and the US.Superdry, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham 16 years ago, was set up by by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success.But its shares have lost nearly 70% over the past year against a tough retail backdrop and in March the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs.Mr Dunkerton is leading the company while it searches for a new permanent chief executive.Kate Culvert, retail analyst at Investec, said: ""With so many moving parts, these types of recovery stories rarely go smoothly and management faces a very long uphill struggle given how challenging the competitive backdrop is""."
business	Laura Ashley profit warning as sales slump		"Laura Ashley has warned investors that it will post profits lower than it had forecast for the financial year.It also said it made zero profit for the last six months of 2018 as sales fell 4.2%.""Trading conditions have been difficult,"" the company said. While fashion sales increased, furniture and decorations fell.The firm's shares fell as much as 22% in London before recovering to a 5% fall, valuing the retailer at £22m.Laura Ashley also said it sold one of its two hotels, the Manor Elstree. However, it insisted it was ""committed to developing the hospitality concept and this will be achieved through the licensing model rather than direct ownership"".Sales for outlets open at least a year fell 4.2% as Japanese partner Aeon Holdings terminated a licence agreement.In December, the fashion and home furnishings retailer told Press Association it could close about 40 stores in the UK as it plans to expand its presence in China. It insisted that no deadline had been set and no stores earmarked.Laura Ashley, which is controlled by Malayan United Industries (MUI), has already closed some 40 UK stores since 2015. December's reduction will leave it with 120 UK stores.High Street stores in the UK have had a difficult year as consumer confidence wanes and fewer shoppers visit.A recent report has shown that some 14 UK shops are closing every day in the tough trading climate.Originally based in Wales, Laura Ashley grew from a small factory in Carno to become one of the world's leading clothing brands in the 1970s and 1980s."
business	French Connection sales fall as it makes small profit		"Sales at struggling fashion chain French Connection fell last year, as a result of the ""difficult"" trading conditions in the UK.Like-for-like sales, fell by 6.8% compared with the previous year, with declines both in store and online.However, for the first time in seven years, the chain made a small profit of £100,000, against a loss of £2.1m.The company said discussions were still ""ongoing"" with several potential buyers of the business.It said it expected its strategic review of the business, including the formal sale process, to be completed in the first half of 2019.)Sports Direct, which is controlled by Mike Ashley, has a 26% stake in French Connection. Founder Stephen Marks, who is also chairman and chief executive, still owns almost 40%.""While we still have a way to go to return the business to an appropriate level of profitability, I believe that we have made and continue to make significant progress,"" Mr Marks said.He said the company's performance had improved despite the ""ongoing difficult retailing trading environment in the UK"".Mr Marks added it was ""clear"" that the UK retail market was ""unlikely to improve in the near future especially given the uncertainty surrounding our exit from the European Union and the knock-on effect that is having on consumer confidence"".But the better performance lifted French Connection shares by 1.9% in early trading.During the year, the chain closed five stores and five concessions within department stores. It has closed more than half its portfolio over the last five years.In a statement, the group said it had expected to close more stores in the second half of last year. How many stores are closed depends on negotiations with landlords over rents.""It is becoming apparent that at the end of leases certain landlords are now becoming more flexible on terms,"" the company said in a statement.French Connection announced last October that it was exploring all strategic options for the business, including a potential sale.Online sales were down ""slightly"" on the previous year, ""reflecting the general trading environment"", said French Connection.However, it added it was also affected by a high staff turnover in the area, especially at a senior level, so it had recruited a new senior team to place ""greater emphasis and focus on this key area of growth"".In April last year, French Connection sold its 75% holding in fashion brand Toast for £11.7m."
business	Tesla reports profit as issues stabilise	'Open the market'The numbers	"Tesla made a profit of $139.5m (£106.4m) in the three months to 31 December - avoiding a loss for a second quarter in a row.While lower than expected, the gain still marked an improvement for the electric car-maker, which has routinely reported shortfalls in recent years.Tesla credited strong demand for its Model 3, manufacturing improvements and recent cost cuts for the turnaround.It forecast strong growth, as Model 3 sales start in Europe and China.However it warned investors that deliveries may slow in coming months, due in part to the time it takes to ship vehicles overseas.""That's our biggest challenge,"" Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said. ""It's not demand. It's how do we get the cars there fast enough.""That challenge is especially acute in the case of China, a major market for electric vehicles, which is in the middle of high-stakes trade talks with the US.Should the two sides fail to reach a deal, it could mean higher tariffs on US-made cars.""We don't know what's going to happen... so it's very important to get those cars there as soon as possible,"" Mr Musk said.Tesla said it expected to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019 - growth of approximately 45% to 65% compared to 2018.Getting its new factory in China up and running by the end of the year is the biggest wildcard for that outlook, Mr Musk said.On a call with financial analysts, Mr Musk thanked the Chinese government for granting the permission for the plant, which he said was the first in the country that is wholly owned by a foreign company.He said he believed the move was ""symbolic of them wanting to open the market.""Mr Musk also announced the firm's chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja was retiring, but said he would continue to serve as a ""senior adviser"" for ""probably years to come.""Tesla was under intense pressure last year, as it spent rapidly to improve production and get its latest car into the hands of customers.The firm said those manufacturing issues have now ""stabilised"".In the most recent quarter, Tesla earned $7.2bn in revenues, primarily from car sales, more than double the same period in 2017.It also reduced its operating expenses by 7% from the quarter before, to about $1bn, roughly the same as in 2017.The decrease follows the announcement of thousands of job cuts in recent months, including about 3,000 in January.Shares dropped by more than 2% in after-hours trading in New York."
business	Just Eat profits up amid merger pressure		"Food delivery service Just Eat has defended itself against a disgruntled shareholder by reporting a sharp rise in 2018 revenue.Fund manager Cat Rock has been calling on the delivery company to seek a merger with a rival.But Just Eat's chairman Mike Evans said the ""strategy set out last year is working"".Revenue rose 43% to £779.5m, while it reversed a loss in 2017 to report profits of £80m.The company said it expected its full-year revenue in 2019 to be between £1bn to £1.1bn.The company said one-fifth of the adult population in the UK used its services, while its delivery business in Canada - SkipTheDishes - was growing rapidly after the introduction of a bilingual service.Peter Duffy, the interim chief executive, said four million new customers joined the business last year.""We have a clear plan for the year ahead as our highly experienced team works hard to accelerate the execution of our strategy and we remain focused on long-term returns for shareholders,"" said Mr Duffy, the chief customer officer, who is currently running the business after the sudden departure of Peter Plumb in January.He said he did not want to be a candidate for the chief executive role permanently.His remarks were welcomed by US investor Cat Rock, which owns about 2% of the company and has been complaining that its slow pace of planning and decision-making will ""result in competitors eroding Just Eat's leading market position"".""We respect and appreciate Peter Duffy's decision to withdraw from the CEO search process, allowing the board to secure a leader with the appropriate online food delivery experience,"" Cat Rock said.""We believe that a merger with a well-run industry peer is a very attractive avenue for securing world-class leadership, delivery expertise, and a premium.""Just Eat is coming under pressure from rivals such as Uber Eats, which is cutting the fees it charges restaurants and has reportedly considered a merger with rival Deliveroo.Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Just East needed to be wary of the threat of rivals. ""Although 2018 has proved a successful year for the firm, 2019 is set to be one of its most challenging to date. With increased competition and greater fiscal red tape, Just Eat will need to get the ingredients just right if it's to continue to enjoy a sizeable slice of the market share,"" she said.A sharp fall in its share price forced it out of the FTSE 100 index last year, but Cat Rock said the shares were up 35% since December when it first started to call for change.""There will no doubt be significant disappointment if the board fails to deliver on the opportunity to create value for all Just Eat shareholders,"" Cat Rock said.The shares were up 1% in late trading."
business	RBS warns of Brexit harm as profits double	A different bank?Customers are not so happy	"Royal Bank of Scotland has reported profits of £1.62bn for 2018, more than double the £752m it made a year earlier.RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance in the face of economic and political uncertainty"".Mr McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"".He told the BBC that Brexit could have a bigger impact on the economy than the Bank of England has suggested.Mr McEwan said: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals.""If this goes on for a long period of time we're going to see the economy slowing down more than the Bank of England suggested.""We have a very small period of time left until the end of March and it's time that our politicians got to the conclusion so that we can get some certainty going forward.""He said that 2018 saw benign economic conditions continue, with low defaults by customers on their loans.But the bank's statement noted the potential impact of ""ongoing political uncertainties and geopolitical tensions"" which could affect its customers, and, as a result, defaults were expected to increase this year.Asked how the bank is preparing for a no deal Brexit, Mr McEwan told the BBC: ""For those businesses that are a bit concerned they may have to pre-buy a number of raw materials for their production, we've put aside £3bn for what we call a Growth Fund"".RBS said NatWest had lent or approved £1.9bn to UK businesses to deal with Brexit (out of a possible £3bn). This could be to stockpile, find new suppliers or to secure trade financing.The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of £45bn and it still owns 62% of the company.In October, RBS paid its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. In its latest results, the bank announced a final dividend of 3.5p per share, and also a 7.5p special dividend, which means the Treasury is set to receive £977m.While the government is still RBS's main shareholder, it also has about 190,000 private investors.The government has been selling off blocks of shares it owns in the bank, and aims to have sold all of its stake by 2024.But it realises a loss every time it does this as it paid 502p a share and they have not yet returned to that level. RBS shares are currently trading at about 240p.Analysis: Rob Young, BBC business correspondentAfter RBS's near-death experience a decade ago, this looks like a very different bank. It's a lot smaller, having sold off large chunks. It also seems to have largely dealt with the financial consequences of its past bad behaviour.RBS hasn't had to set aside more cash to pay for PPI compensation this year. The boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, says the bank is pretty much fixed.That doesn't mean taxpayers are about to get all of their £45bn bailout cheque paid back. Despite the bank's rising profits, we'll probably still own part of it for a few more years yet. And even when we no longer have a stake in RBS, few expect the Treasury to break even.There's also the chance that political events could knock plans to sell off the public stake. The bank is warning of the economic consequences of a no deal Brexit.Mr McEwan says a deal needs to be done by the end of March. If not, he says the economy would take a hit. That could mean a rise in bad loans for the bank. That wouldn't be good for RBS's recovery.RBS has continued with its plan to shrink itself. Its assets, which in banking largely means its outstanding loans, shrank from £738.1bn to £694.2bn.Before the financial crisis, it was briefly the largest bank in the world by assets.The bank said the switch from physical to digital services was continuing to grow rapidly with 6.4 million customers now regularly using its mobile app, a 16% rise from 2017.But it gave a severe assessment of the risks presented by cyberattacks.It said such attacks were increasing in frequency, sophistication, impact and severity.Competition in the mortgage market meant profit margins remained thin, it said.Its net interest margin - the difference between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans, and a key measure of a bank's ability to make money - shrank to 1.98% from 2.13%.Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporterProfits may have doubled, but there is little to cheer for RBS in the latest official customer satisfaction rankings.The Royal Bank of Scotland brand was the bottom of 16 banks for overall service quality for personal customers in Britain, and 13th out of 14 for satisfaction among small business account holders.Stablemate NatWest, also part of the RBS group, was in the bottom half of both league tables.The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank) and nearly 20,000 small businesses asked how likely they would be to recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank.The results are revealed by the Competition and Markets Authority every six months, with the latest published on Friday.The aim is to encourage competition between banks on customer service. Metro Bank topped the league for personal customers and Handelsbanken was ranked the best by small businesses."
business	Ted Baker shares tumble after profit warning		"Shares in Ted Baker have tumbled over 12% after the fashion chain warned profits would be lower-than-expected.The retailer blamed currency movements, product costs and a writedown on unsold stock for the disappointment.It said full-year profit for the year ending on 26 January would be around £63m, compared to forecasts of £73.8m.The firm's shares were hit late last year amid a hugging controversy after staff alleged they suffered unwanted embraces from founder Ray Kelvin.The company has appointed a law firm to conduct an independent external investigation into the hugging allegations, which it disputes.Mr Kelvin announced in December that he would take a voluntary leave of absence.Investors had feared that negative publicity surrounding harassment allegations against Mr Kelvin would affect the brand's popularity.But the retailer's Christmas trading update last month showed a 12.2% rise in sales.In December, an online petition launched by employees accused 62-year-old Mr Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour, including ""forced hugging"".The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence about at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group.Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears.At the time, Mr Kelvin said that it was ""only right"" Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate.""I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. It's for that reason that I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence,"" he said."
business	Barclays profits amid UK economic 'uncertainty' in UK	Brexit concerns	"Barclays has reported a profit of £3.5bn for 2018, unchanged on the previous year.The bank also announced a provision of £150m for ""anticipated economic uncertainty"" related to Brexit.If the economy suffers after the UK's departure from the EU, the extra allowance will help Barclays cover costs such as rising bad debts.The bank's chief executive, Jes Staley, said 2018 had been a ""very significant"" year, with several issues resolved.Last year, it took charges of £2.2bn to cover legal issues and fines, including a large settlement with US regulators and, in the UK, compensation over PPI.Barclays confirmed that it will pay a dividend of 6.5p this year.The company's management is under pressure from US-based financier Edward Bramson to raise its performance.Mr Bramson owns a 5.5% stake and wants to take a seat on the board. In particular, he thinks Barclays should scale back its investment bank.Last year, the investment bank reported a 15% increase in profits to £2.6bn.In a statement accompanying the latest results, Mr Staley said his plans would be good for shareholders.He said the bank planned to return a greater proportion of its earnings to shareholders, including buying back shares in the company, a move which traditionally supports the share price.Barclays is not the only bank to warn about the possible negative impact of Brexit on the economy.Last week, RBS chief Ross McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"".He told the BBC: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term, because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals.""At the end of last year, HSBC also raised its provision for economic uncertainty in the UK by £165m to £410m.Commenting on the provision made by Barclays, Laith Khalaf, from stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""As with all the UK banks, Brexit casts a shadow over valuations, despite improving fundamentals.""Indeed Brexit uncertainty has prompted Barclays to put aside £150 million in case of deteriorating economic conditions in the UK. That could prove to be insufficient or over-cautious, depending on proceedings in Westminster and Brussels. Therein lies the puzzle of the UK banking sector which explains lowly share prices; like Schrödinger's cat, no-one's quite sure what state it's in."""
business	Santander UK bank profits hit by uncertainty		"Profits at the UK arm of Santander fell last year after what the High Street bank described as an ""uncertain operating environment"".While it said its mortgage lending was its strongest for three years in the highly competitive market, profit margins were squeezed.Profits for 2018 were £1.6bn, down 14% year-on-year.The bank also revealed that it was setting aside £58m for issues in its consumer credit operation.This is likely to be a reference to its credit card business. However, Santander did not disclosed further details.It also confirmed that the figures include the cost of last month's £32.8m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority for ""serious failings"" in dealing with the accounts of deceased customers.Nathan Bostock, the chief executive of the UK business, said: ""Our 2018 financial performance reflects our strategy of selective growth, while actively managing costs in the competitive and uncertain operating environment"".Earlier this month, the bank said it would close 140 branches because customers were not using them as much.The UK bank, which is part of Spanish giant Santander, said its preparations for Brexit were ""comprehensive"".""While uncertainty around Brexit remains we are preparing for a number of outcomes in order to minimise the impact on our customers and our business,"" the bank said in a statement.Full-year profits of the entire bank were up 18% at €7.8bn (£6.8bn).Santander's operations in Brazil were the biggest contributor, generating around a quarter for the profits.""Latin America remains an important engine of growth for the group, with good progress, especially in Brazil and Mexico,"" said the bank's chairwoman Ana Botin.Last year, the bank recruited the head of investment banking at UBS, Andrea Orcell, to be its next chief executive.However, this decision has been reversed after the bank said it could not meet his expectations on pay, reportedly worth €50m. The Financial Times has reported that he is preparing legal action."
business	Uber: Two top executives leave in leadership 'reshuffle'		"Uber's chief operating officer and chief marketing officer have stepped down following a leadership reshuffle at the ride-hailing app.In an internal memo, chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi explained the moves were intended to give him more control over day-to-day operations.The decision comes nearly a month after a shaky start to Uber's listing on the New York Stock Exchange.Shares slid 7.6% on their first day of trading, but have since recovered.Uber then posted a $1bn (£790m) loss last month, despite strong revenue growth.The losses were, however, in line with several forecasts and may provide reassurance about the company's future profitability.As part of the reorganisation, which was detailed in the memo seen by several news outlets, Mr Khosrowshahi said he had eliminated the position of COO, which Barney Harford had held since January 2018.Mr Khosrowshahi said the role ""no longer makes sense"", and Uber's Rides and Eats teams would now directly report to him in order to help ""problem-solve in real time"".Rebecca Messina - who joined as head of marketing nine months ago - has also stepped aside, with marketing operations set to be combined with Uber's policy and communications and policy team, led by Jill Hazelbaker.""This is Dara... taking over the wheels at a time the company really needs to execute in the eyes of the public investors,"" Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told AP news agency.""It's a double-edged sword for him, because it's going to put that much more pressure on the success of Uber riding on his shoulders."""
business	Goals Soccer Centres warns on profit after 'accounting errors'	Debt burden	"Five-a-side football company Goals Soccer Centres has issued a profit warning and says it has uncovered ""accounting errors"".It says full-year results will be ""materially below"" expectations, and it will delay the results' publication.The firm, which operates 50 outdoor football centres in the UK and California, said it was also having to renegotiate the terms of its loans.Shares in the company plunged over 30% in early trading.The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who owns over an 18% stake in the firm.The accounting error means it broke the terms of its banking agreement.The company and its auditors are reviewing its accounting practices and policies.""It is likely that the board will take a more prudent approach both for 2018 full year results and going forward,"" it said.In January, the East Kilbride-based firm warned on profits after it said that selling food and drink, and offering children's birthday parties, had increased costs as it had to hire more staff.In spite of this, it had still estimated profit for 2018 of between £4.3m to £4.5m, figures which are now in question.Goals Soccer Centres has about £29m of debt and is allowed by its bank to have borrowings of three times its earnings before tax and other adjustments. A dip in those earnings would therefore imperil this agreement.The company said trading in the first two months of the year had been ""strong with an increase in like-for-like sales, in both the UK and US, over the comparable period in 2018"".Goals has been upgrading its pitches and plans to launch a new football academy in the US with Manchester City."
business	John Lewis bonus lowest since 1950s as profits plunge	What's gone wrong at John Lewis?'Market adjustment'	"John Lewis has paid out its lowest bonus to staff since the 1950s as profits plunged last year amid ""challenging"" trading.The retail partnership - which includes Waitrose supermarkets - said staff would receive a 3% bonus, the lowest since 1953 when workers got no bonus.Profits at the partnership sank last year by more than 45% to £160m.It blamed poor home sales, discounting, higher IT costs and the cost of opening two new stores last year for the drop.John Lewis' famously promises that is ""never knowingly undersold"", meaning it matches its High Street rivals' prices.The partnership said ""near constant discounting"" from rivals had hit profits, particularly in its department store shops.John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners.Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of the profits. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay.But the annual staff bonus has been reduced every year for the past six years due to difficult trading conditions.Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said the lower bonus would help the company to preserve cash and invest ""to cope with the continuing uncertainty facing consumers and the economy"".Analysis: Howard Mustoe, business reporterThere are four key reasons the department store chain is struggling. It's ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" guarantee ties its hands on price as it matches the price of a product with competitors. There's also the general ""relevance problem"" of department stores, with the rise of online shopping.And there's the squeeze on incomes that is seeing consumers cut back on certain types of spending. And staying relevant costs money - John Lewis has had to invest in IT, as many other retailers have, to meet customer demand.Read more hereJohn Lewis said ""subdued demand, excess retail space and some other retailers' distress"" had led to big discounts by shops since last October.Like-for-like sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell 1.4% in its department stores last year.It said weaker home sales in particular had contributed to the drop, with ""subdued"" consumer confidence hitting demand for ""big ticket and bespoke items"".The department store model has been under pressure for several years. BHS collapsed in 2016, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley last year. Earlier this week, struggling department store chain Debenhams issued its fourth profit warning in a little over a year as its sales continued to fall.Sir Charlie - who is stepping down next year - said the current High Street problems were ""an inevitable market adjustment which will require greater clarity on whether brands are competing on scale or difference.""Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said the fact that John Lewis was struggling showed how bad the situation was.""If the bellwether John Lewis is creaking, you can be sure others are feeling the pain.""In the short term, things don't look like getting much better, but further out, John Lewis may ultimately pick up market share from others who fall by the wayside. A larger slice of the pie could be the reward for staying the course, but what remains to be seen is just how big a pie is left after the current shift in retail washes through the system.""One brighter spot in the results was Waitrose. Like-for-like sales at the supermarket rose 1.3% last year, with profits up 18%.However, John Lewis said it had sold off five of its Waitrose stores to rival retailers, putting 440 roles at risk of redundancy. The firm said the shops were not ""commercially sustainable"" in the long term.The affected stores are:On Brexit, the partnership said it was ""in a good position for a managed transition"".But warned an unmanaged transition risked ""a strong fall in consumer confidence and the impact that has on trade""."
business	John Lewis to start building home extensions		"John Lewis is planning to expand its offering from furnishing homes to extending and renovating them.The employee-owned business said it wanted to be involved in every area of home improvement from design to construction.John Lewis already runs a booking site for tradespeople and last year it acquired a home improvement firm, Opun.But now it is planning on bringing both of those services under one roof to design and build extensions.Opun designs and installs bathrooms and kitchens as well as undertaking loft conversions and extensions.Since it was acquired by John Lewis in September 2018, Opun, which undertakes large-scale construction projects, has been operating independently but now it will work alongside Home Solutions, which finds tradespeople for smaller jobs.John Lewis director Sean Allam said the deal to buy Opun demonstrated the department store's ambition to grow in the home services market.The firm is now looking at how best to bring these services to its customers.Both Opun and Home Solutions sit in a part of the business that is supposed to create new products for both John Lewis and Waitrose, which is also part of the partnership.John Lewis had a difficult year in 2018. Profits plunged by more than 45% to £130m, as department stores fight to stay relevant in the face of competition from online retailers.But retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC that building up the home improvement business was unlikely to make a difference to short term profitability at John Lewis.Instead, Mr Hyman said it was probably a response to a slowdown in the housing market, which he attributed to the ""prohibitive"" cost of stamp duty.He said that had an impact on ""connected markets"" like John Lewis, which sells the furniture for those homes."
business	Ryanair issues profit warning as fares fall		"Ryanair has cut its profit forecast blaming lower-than-expected air fares.The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said Ryanair could not rule out having to cut fares further. Fares are expected to fall 7% this winter.He said the low fares were already causing problems for rivals, including Flybe which was rescued last week.Full-year profits are now expected to be in a range of €1.0bn to €1.1bn (£880m to £970m), compared with its previous forecast of €1.1bn to €1.2bn.The profit forecast has been cut despite Ryanair saying it expects to carry more passengers than forecast.It had previously warned on profits in October.Mr O'Leary said there was too much capacity on short-haul routes in Europe this winter, adding that customers were enjoying ""record lower air fares"".""We believe this lower fare environment will continue to shake out more loss making competitors, with WOW, Flybe, and reportedly Germania for example, all currently for sale,"" he said.The airline had previously expected air fares to fall by 2%, rather than 7%.More cuts could be coming, Mr O'Leary added.""While we have reasonable visibility over forward bookings [for the fourth quarter], we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact yields between now and the end of March,"" he said.The announcement follows last week's rescue of Flybe, which has received an offer from a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group.It also comes after difficult period for Ryanair, which was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a survey carried out by consumer body Which?.Strikes by staff during the summer season forced it to cancel hundreds of flights for which it has refused to offer passengers compensation, and Which? said ""thousands of respondents"" had said they would never fly with the airline again.The impact of these strikes was reflected in Ryanair's half-year results in October, when it reported a 7% fall in profits, although the airline was also affected by industrial action by air traffic controllers.Ryanair said the latest profits guidance excluded start-up losses in Austrian airline Lauda, which have been cut from €150m to €140m thanks to lower-than-expected costs.Mr O'Leary said the airline was winning market share, citing plans by rival carrier Norwegian to close bases in Rome, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Palma, where the airlines compete.More detail will be provided with third quarter figures on 4 February, Ryanair said."
business	Oxfam alleges abuse in UK supermarket supply chains	Pesticide priceSupermarket action	"Workers on farms and plantations that supply big UK supermarkets are being subjected to poverty and human rights abuses, according to Oxfam.A ""relentless"" drive for retailer profits is fuelling poverty, abuse, and discrimination, the charity said.Poor conditions were rife on farms that supply supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, it added.But the British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""spearheading actions"" intended to improve millions of lives.Oxfam conducted research in India and Brazil, and surveyed workers in five other countries.Workers on 50 tea plantations in Assam told Oxfam that cholera and typhoid are ""prevalent because workers lack access to toilets and safe drinking water"".Half the workers questioned got ration cards from the government due to low wages, while female employees regularly worked for up to 13 ""back-breaking"" hours a day, it said.Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi all source tea from those suppliers, while Asda-owner Walmart would neither confirm nor deny whether it did, the charity said.Oxfam found that, of the 79p paid by shoppers for a 100g pack of black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers collectively received 3p.The charity said workers on the Assam estates could earn a living wage if they were paid 5p more of the retail price.Workers on fruit farms in Brazil told Oxfam they had developed skin conditions from using pesticides without adequate protection.Women on those grape, melon and mango farms also said they had to rely on government handouts outside of harvest season.Those farms supply supermarkets including Lidl and Sainsbury's, and previously Tesco and Morrisons, the charity said.Walmart again neither confirmed nor denied links.Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam ethical trade manager, said: ""Despite some pockets of good practice, supermarkets' relentless pursuit of profits continues to fuel poverty and human rights abuses in their supply chains.""Supermarkets must do more to end exploitation, pay all their workers a living wage, ensure women get a fair deal and be more transparent about where they source their products.""A separate Oxfam survey of more than 500 workers in the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Peru and the US found three quarters of workers saying they were not paid enough to cover basic needs such as food and housing.More than a third said they were not protected from injury or harm at work and were not able to take a toilet break or have a drink of water when they needed it.An Oxfam spokesperson said abuses in supermarket supply chains were ""endemic"".However, Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain.""Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs [non-governmental organisations], business groups and government on this vital issue.""Meanwhile, Oxfam ranked supermarket giants on their sourcing policies, with all showing an improvement compared with last year.Tesco, which was at the top of the pile, was given a score of 38%.A Tesco spokesperson said: ""This is the second year in a row that Tesco has been assessed by Oxfam as doing most, of all major supermarkets globally, to ensure human rights are respected in food supply chains.""It said its tea was Rainforest Alliance certified and that it was ""committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions.""It added: ""We know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.""An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected.""We share the values behind Oxfam's campaign and are in regular dialogue with them."""
business	Centrica says 2019 profit to be hit by energy price cap	Losing more accounts	"British Gas owner Centrica said its profit this year will be hit by the energy regulator's tariff price cap.The company reported a 12% rise in annual group operating profits to £1.39bn for 2018, but described its performance as ""mixed"".""We have been very clear that we do not believe a price cap is a sustainable solution for the market,"" Centrica said.The company also said it plans to sell more businesses this year.The company's shares closed nearly 12% lower on Thursday.Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said the share price drop ""is hardly surprising given the warning on cash flow comes on top of pressures from the energy bill cap and lower than expected income from the company's share in EDF's nuclear reactors.""All of that combines to raise a big question mark over this year's dividend payments, and possibly those in future years as well.""The new energy price cap came into force on 1 January. Ofgem has estimated that the cap will save 11 million people an average of £76 a year.But Centrica said on Thursday that regulator Ofgem's tariff cap ""is likely to have unintended consequences for customers and competition"".Typically, the cap means that typical usage by a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit will cost no more than £1,137 a year.Consumer organisations say that people could save more by switching supplier.Centrica also said Spirit Energy gas exploration business and nuclear business produced ""disappointing"" results.The company will sell Clockwork Inc, a North American plumbing and electrician franchise business, for $300m (£230m) after a slow recovery in its business on the continent.It will sell £500m of businesses this year, it said, including Clockwork.It lost 742,000 energy supply accounts, it said, a decline of 6%, to 12.1 million accounts.Part of the reason for British Gas losing customers is that it rarely appears among the cheapest deals on price comparison websites when customers look to switch suppliers.Many of the cheapest deals are offered by the smallest suppliers, owing in part to the fact that these firms do not have to pay the green taxes levied on the medium and large companies.Centrica is mounting a legal challenge against the price cap, arguing it has not been calculated fairly.The energy provider said it would apply for a judicial review against the regulator Ofgem, saying it had set the threshold too low.Iain Conn, Centrica's chief executive, told the BBC's Today programme on Radio 4 that there would be a £300m hit to its profits, reducing its UK consumer energy business profits by about two thirds. It would mean UK consumer energy would go from being about a third of Centrica's profits to less than 15%.""If we do nothing about it they would be down by £300m,"" he said. ""We have not been supportive of price controls in a free market.""The regulator has said it would defend its proposals ""robustly"".Ofgem proposed a cap on energy bills in September, following concerns that consumers were not getting best value for money from suppliers' default rates, or standard variable tariffs (SVT)."
business	RBS slumps to loss after £900m hit from PPI		"Royal Bank of Scotland has swung to a loss in the third quarter after taking a hit from the cost of payment protection insurance.The Edinburgh-based bank, in which the government owns a 62% stake, added its investment bank had a ""particularly challenging"" three months.It reported a pre-tax loss of £8m for the July-to-September period after it took a £900m charge for PPI.These are the last results before chief executive Ross McEwan departs.The New Zealander is being replaced by Alison Rose next month, when she becomes the first woman to lead one of the UK's big four banks. She joined the bank 27 years ago as a graduate trainee.The bank had reported a £961m profit in the same three months a year ago.But Katie Murray, the finance director, said the results ""demonstrate our solid underlying performance in a tough operating environment"".""The core retail and commercial bank continues to perform well and we are making good progress against our targets for the year,"" she said.But its investment banking arm, known as NatWest Markets, reported a £193m loss for the quarter as it felt the impact of a ""deterioration in economic sentiment for the global economy and a fall in bond yields"".RBS had warned last month that, like other lenders, it faced a bill for further compensation for mis-sold PPI, but its £900m hit was at the top end of expectations.PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them.The industry says there has been surge in claims for compensation ahead of a 29 August deadline set by the Financial Conduct Authority.The return to a quarterly loss - the first since the last quarter of 2017 - presents a fresh challenge for Ms Rose, who takes over as the UK prepares to leave the EU and when the bank's revenues are under pressure.The bank has been trying to demonstrate that it can consistently return to profit.It reported about £60bn of losses in the nine years after its 2008 bailout before reporting its first full-year profit since that government-backed rescue in 2018.On a nine-month measure, the bank remained in profit, reporting £2.7bn of profits.John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""The last set of results for RBS were a watershed moment for the bank, confirming it is on the road to redemption.""Whilst this remains the case, today's statement highlights the legacy issues that the bank, and many of its peers, still face - in particular, PPI claims have pushed RBS back to a loss.""Despite these bumps on the road, RBS is a very different bank to what it once was and continues to make good progress on a path to recovery.""On another measure, the bottom line or attributable to shareholders, the bank's quarterly losses reached £315m, compared with a £448m profit a year earlier."
business	Ad giant WPP sees profits sink amid restructuring costs	New competition	"Ad giant WPP has seen profits drop sharply as it continues to restructure the business following former boss Sir Martin Sorrell's abrupt exit last year.Sir Martin quit after allegations of personal misconduct, which he denied.Pre-tax profits at the firm fell almost a third last year to £1.46bn, a drop it blamed largely on restructuring costs.WPP also reiterated 2019 would be ""challenging, particularly in the first half"" as client losses from last year continues to weigh on the business.Despite the profit fall, the firm's performance was at the upper end of the guidance it provided last year, helping to boost its shares 9% in early trading.Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said last year's results were ""slightly better than expected"", but said the firm's commentary on 2019 was also more positive than expected.New boss Mark Read said the firm was at the start of a ""three-year turnaround plan"".""It's early days in what we need to do but I would say the initial signs are promising,"" he told Reuters.Mr Read picked its controversial Gillette ad campaign as one of the firm's highlights for last year.The ad, called Believe, played on the razor firm's famous slogan ""The best a man can get"", replacing it with ""The best men can be"".While some praised the message of the advert, it also came in for criticism, with some customers threatening to boycott the brand.Mr Read said the ad demonstrated ""the global impact of what we do"".WPP - which owns major agencies such as Ogilvy and JWT - has been selling off assets to raise money. It said it had sold 36 divisions since last April, helping to strengthen its balance sheet.Founded as a holding company in 1986, WPP's operations today span creative agencies, public relations, consultancy and data analytics.However, it has been struggling over the past few years amid mounting competition from tech platforms Facebook and Google as more advertising moves online.Traditional consultancies such as Deloitte are also entering the market while major clients such as Unilever are spending less on advertising.Sir Martin built WPP from a small engineering company to create the world's biggest ad agency.He has since formed rival venture S4 Capital and in July outbid his former company to buy the Dutch digital production company MediaMonks."
business	Brexit recession warning from RBS boss	'Very cautious'	"RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has warned a no-deal Brexit could tip the UK economy into recession.He told the BBC a ""bad Brexit"" could result in ""zero or negative"" economic growth which would hit RBS's share price.He also said the bank was becoming careful about lending to certain sectors of the economy - particularly retail and construction.RBS is still 64% owned by the taxpayer following its bailout 10 years ago.Mr McEwan said: ""We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative and that would affect our profitability and our share price.""The news that RBS is withdrawing credit will heap further woes on the retail sector which has already seen nearly 2000 stores close so far this year.""There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven't made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,"" said Mr McEwan.He also reported jitters in construction.""The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital - particularly around London.""Although its appetite for lending across the economy was unchanged overall, he said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year as they delayed investment decisions.""Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I'll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it's really bad I'll invest elsewhere - that's the reality of where we are today.""On a brighter note, he said small and medium sized companies seemed relatively unaffected and were continuing to borrow, invest and grow their businesses.The government has repeatedly said that a ""no deal"" Brexit is not its preferred outcome and this week reinforced its commitment to securing a deal before the end of the year.However, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said the chances of failing to secure a deal are ""uncomfortably high"" and many at the Conservative Party conference were clear that leaving without a deal is better than signing up to the government's current plan.We should care what Ross McEwan says for two reasons.First, as a bank that does almost all its lending in the UK, its fortunes are dependent on those of the economy as a whole. Second, taxpayers still own two-thirds of this bank.When Ross McEwan sounds notes of caution about the future - he's talking to all of us."
business	Asos profits hit by fashion price-cutting	Confidence knocked	"Online fashion retailer Asos has warned of weak profits this financial year after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit its trading in November.After reports of dismal High Street activity last month, the Asos warning indicates the pain is spreading online.The firm said cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes.In fact, economic uncertainty plus weaker consumer confidence had led to ""the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years"".Asos shares fell nearly 40% in morning trading.Chief executive Nick Beighton said the fashion industry was currently experiencing an ""unprecedented level of discounting, something I've not seen before"".In a conference call with industry analysts, he said consumer confidence was ""fragile"".Despite sales growth of 14% from September to November, Asos saw ""a significant deterioration"" in November.It had previously forecast sales growth of 20-25% in the year to August 2019. However, it now expects just 15% growth.Its anticipated profit margin was also revised down, from 4% to 2%.Worried voices of retail are becoming a deafening chorus and the lyrics are simple. November was bad - really bad - and not just on the High Street.Online retail darling Asos saw its shares plunge 35% this morning after warning that its profits would undershoot expectations. Comments from chief executive Nick Beighton describing an ""unprecedented level of discounting"" saw other retailers' share prices slump, including those of Boohoo, Next and JD Sports.Last week, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley said November had been the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"".The woes of predominantly bricks-and-mortar retailers (like clothing retailer Bonmarché, which saw its shares halve as it lurched to a £4m loss last week) have been well chronicled, but the significance of the Asos update is that it shows the fight for every last pound and every last percentage point of profit margin has spread online.There may yet be a late rush, but evidence so far suggests retailers' annus horribilis is not ending well.""Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations,"" Asos said.""There has been a high level of discounting and promotional activity across the market. We have increased our own level of promotional activity, leading to a higher discount and continued high clearance mix.""This increased discounting, coupled with the unseasonably warm weather during the last three months has reduced our ASP [average selling price], which has not been compensated by higher units per basket.""Outside the UK, Asos said trading conditions in Germany and France, which account for about 60% of its EU sales, had become ""significantly more challenging"".Over the three months to 30 November, total group revenue was £656m, up from £576.7m in the same period last year.Rival firm Boohoo saw its shares tumble 10% in the wake of the Asos announcement.However, it said it was ""pleased to confirm"" that its trading performance remained strong, ""with record Black Friday sales across the group"", and that it continued to trade ""comfortably in line with market expectations"".Asos's bleak assessment comes after Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley described trading in November as ""the worst on record, unbelievably bad"".""Retailers just cannot take that kind of November,"" Mr Ashley told analysts last week. ""It will literally smash them to pieces.""George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""After making impressive strides in recent years, a challenging consumer backdrop has finally tripped Asos up.""Recent data revealed a huge decline in UK retail footfall, which it would have been easy to assume was due to online players taking share at a faster rate. These numbers show it's more complicated, and more worrying, than that.""It looks like consumer confidence has been knocked to the extent people aren't spending much anywhere, be it in physical stores or online.""Mr Salmon said ""uncertainty around Brexit"" would also be playing a major role.He added: ""It's probably no coincidence Asos's key demographic of 20-somethings generally harbour more concerns over the future of the economy post-Brexit than their parents."""
business	Fashion firm Quiz issues second profit warning	'Discounting killing retailers'	"Fast-growing fashion retailer Quiz has made its second profit warning in three months.It now expects to make £8.2m, down from an estimate of £11.5m made in October.Quiz targets 16 to 35-year-old ""fashion forward females"". Last year it launched a new collection with Love Island finalist, Gabby Allen.Glasgow-based Quiz was founded in 1993 and has 70 stores and 148 concessions across the UK, as well as dozens of franchises overseas.It has outlets in the Republic of Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Cyprus, Egypt, Georgia and Pakistan.After the announcement its shares slumped by 33% in London trading.The profit warning comes despite reports that its revenues are growing.The group said that Christmas trading - between 25 November 2018 and 5 January - saw revenues rise 8.4%.The group's online revenue jumped by 34.1% during the period.Founder and chief executive Mr Ramzan said: ""Against the backdrop of challenging trading conditions over recent months, Quiz has delivered further revenue growth over the Christmas period driven by the performance of our own websites. ""But he said the growth and the margin achieved had ""been below our initial expectations"".Gross margins in the six months to 31 March 2019 are now expected to be around 60.5%, down from 62% in the six months to 30 September.Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Quiz became the latest High Street casualty as its shares plummeted on a profits warning. Overall performance isn't bad at all - sales rose more than 8.4%, led by a 34.1% jump in online revenues. High Street sales held up ok, rising 1.6%.""But we got a bad profits warning. It looks like discounting is really killing retailers.""There is just no way they can pass on higher costs by raising prices. Consumers are simply not prepared to pay more. The discounting vicious circle means shoppers are now expecting big price reductions. Margins at Quiz are like others coming under a lot of pressure from heavy discounting.""The group attracted more than £100m from investors when it floated on the London Stock Exchange's junior Aim market in July 2018.It set aside more than £10m of that to help fund further expansion."
business	Is Uber really worth billions of dollars?	What reception will Uber get?When will Uber make a profit?What do Uber's IPO documents reveal?What now for Uber?	"Everything about Uber is big.The taxi app and delivery business is America's biggest venture capital-backed company.It is forecast to raise $10bn ($7.6bn) when it sells its shares on the New York Stock Exchange - one of the largest amounts on record.And the 10-year-old company could be valued at as much as $90bn when it floats.However, the other big thing about Uber is its losses which, although down on the previous year, hit $3bn in 2018.And that raises the biggest point of all - when will Uber make a profit and perhaps justify that massive market valuation?It is the question that Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will face over the next few weeks as he embarks on a roadshow to visit potential investors ahead of the flotation, which is expected in May.Uber is not the first of its ilk to float this year.Of the so-called unicorns - venture capital-backed businesses valued at $1bn or more - Uber's closest US rival, Lyft, floated at the end of March, while online scrapbook company Pinterest is expected to list its shares next week.But so far, those initial public offerings (IPO) have shown that there is some caution over valuations. Lyft's stock price has fallen 15.2% since it floated.Pinterest has priced its shares at between $15 and $17 each, which gives it a value of up to $11.3bn. However, that is still below the $12bn valuation the company had during its most recent round of private funding two years ago.Against this backdrop, will Uber be able to hit that $100bn valuation?Kathleen Smith, from Renaissance Capital, says: ""I think sometimes they are a little bit tone deaf because they've been in a world where everyone has been climbing all over themselves to get to invest in their companies.""They think then 'oh, that means they'll roll out the red carpet in the public markets' - and it's not that kind of place.""The company is unlikely to make any money soon, according to the IPO documents it filed on Thursday.""We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the US and other major markets,"" it said. ""We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability.""It expects losses to continue in the ""near-term"" because of higher investment in areas such as increasing the use of its apps, expanding into new markets and continuing to develop its autonomous cars division.In a letter to potential shareholders, Mr Khosrowshahi said: ""We will not shy away from making short-term financial sacrifices where we see clear long-term benefits.""Jordan Stuart, from Federated Investors Inc., says investors are willing to be patient when it comes to profit, but only if a company can spell out how it intends to get there.Amazon, for example, didn't make an annual profit until six years after its 1997 flotation. Even then, it took a while before investors could see a sustainable path to profitability.Mr Stuart said: ""The stock really moved let's say five or six years ago when they were really able to show 'hey, we can turn off investment to show profitability if we want and give up top line growth for bottom line growth but we're not going to do that'.""Some of these companies, if they can show that scalability, that ability to turn that profit nozzle on or off, then I think investors... are going to give companies a chance to say 'this is worth X amount of billions of dollars'.""Uber's sales are growing. Revenue has risen from $3.8bn in 2016 to $11.2bn in 2018.Gross bookings from Uber's core business - which accounts for the majority of sales - jumped from $18.8bn in 2016 to $41.5bn last year.In its filing, Uber says it expects people to move away from the expense of owning a car to using services to get around.Uber is also investing in e-bikes and e-scooters where it hopes to capture customers who make shorter journeys.But investors want to see a plan.Mr Stuart said: ""I do believe [investors] have raised the bar and said 'we're not going to look at clicks or eyeballs or users anymore unless you can show us where is that profitability'.""Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst Wedbush Securities, said the company's IPO filing is the first time people will be able to ""really get under the covers of Uber to understand the financials"".But there are some areas of concern.The firm's US and Canadian business does not appear to have recovered from the #DeleteUber campaign in 2017 - not a stellar year for the company - which was first spurred by claims that Uber attempted to break a taxi strike by New York taxi drivers.The hashtag then reappeared on social media when former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a blog which alleged a toxic work environment at the company.Uber said ""our ridesharing category position generally declined in 2018 in the substantial majority of the regions in which we operate impacted in part by heavy subsidies and discounts by our competitors in various markets"".Another potential concern is the employment status of Uber's drivers. They are classed as independent contractors, but Uber is still facing legal issues about this and if workers were to be considered employees then Uber could face higher costs.Uber did not specify what price it will sell its shares at - that is something to be determined over the coming weeks as Mr Khosrowshahi meets potential investors.""A lot of technology investors are looking for is who is going to be the next FAANG,"" said Mr Ives, referring to the acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google.But Ms Smith said: ""In light of the fact that we have seen Lyft and its very poor trading and then in seeing what Pinterest is doing tells me that investors may be a bit more 'wait and see' about Uber."""
business	Samsung warns of profit drop as chip demand slows		"Samsung Electronics expects to post a 29% drop in quarterly operating profit as demand for smartphones and memory chips slows.The firm forecasts operating earnings of 10.8 trillion Korean won ($9.7bn; £7.6bn) for the last three months of 2018.It marks the first quarterly profit drop in two years as strong demand for chips had boosted earnings at the firm.Samsung also faces fierce competition from Apple and Chinese rivals.In a statement on Tuesday, the firm cited lacklustre demand and rising competition for its darkening outlook.""We expect earnings to remain subdued in the first quarter of 2019 due to difficult conditions for the memory business,"" the South Korean tech giant said in a statement.It forecasts revenue will decline 11% to 59 trillion won.Samsung will provide detailed earnings later this month.The firm had seen earnings surge in recent years largely due to strong appetite for memory chips in mobile devices.Slowing demand, including from China, is weighing on the wider sector.Last week, Apple warned that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China."
business	Premier League leads European football to £25bn valuation	'Competitive nature'Tax contributionScottish broadcast deals	"The big five European leagues generated a record €15.6bn (£13.8bn) in revenue in 2017-18, a 6% annual increase, according to new figures from Deloitte.It says the European football market is now worth some €28.4bn (£25.1bn).The English Premier League was the market leader, with record revenues of £4.8bn, as five teams competed in the Champions League for the first time.Germany's Bundesliga overtook Spain's La Liga to become the second-largest revenue generating league in the world.Deloitte said during the 2017-18 season, European club football was in the ""strongest financial position that we've ever seen"".""This reflects the drive among leading clubs to generate ever greater revenues to fund success on the pitch and also the sustained efforts of UEFA to improve profitability and sustainability of clubs through Financial Fair Play and club licensing,"" said Dan Jones, partner and head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte.With a quintet of English teams competing in the Champions League in 2017-18, and all reaching round 16 or beyond, Uefa payouts to clubs increased by about £71m.Alongside the increase in European cash, match-day and commercial revenue also both grew at Premier League clubs - by 8% and 12% respectively.However, following record operating profits in 2016-17, increased spending on player wages contributed to reduced operating profits. They fell by 16% to £867m, still the second highest level of profitability to date.""This wage spending is an indication of the competitive nature of the division, with the top clubs competing for financially lucrative places in Uefa competitions, and clubs lower down the division fighting to remain in the Premier League itself,"" said Mr Jones.""With the sale of the Premier League's domestic and international broadcast rights now complete for the 2019-20 to 2021-22 seasons, resulting in an overall 8% revenue increase, Premier League clubs will receive further increases in central distributions in the coming seasons.""However, the increase is not as significant as in the previous two cycles and therefore clubs will aim to improve their competitive and financial position through developing and growing other commercial revenue.""He said that while the Premier League had retained its leading position financially, other leagues would continue to grow in coming years.In the second-tier English Championship, record wage levels have led to record operating losses.Wages outstripped revenues, highlighting the financial risks that Championship clubs are willing to take in order to gain promotion to the Premier League. However, net debt among Championship clubs almost halved over the course of the season.Other findings regarding English football finances in 2017-18 include:Meanwhile, Scottish revenues increased to £206m in 2017-18, driven by match-day revenue growth of 19%.The Premiership saw its highest average attendances since 2006-07, aided by the return of Hibernian to the top flight.Following the termination of the SPFL's international media rights agreement with broadcast agency MP & Silva, replacement deals were signed. Those agreements with beIN Sports and other broadcasters made the league available to view in 119 territories for two seasons from 2018-19.In addition, Deloitte says an exclusive five-year domestic broadcast rights deal with Sky Sports should deliver a 20% increase on the current deal from season 2020-21.Outside the UK, the commencement of the German Bundesliga's new broadcast arrangements saw it leapfrog La Liga to become number two in terms of revenue generation.The Bundesliga also remains the best-attended European league, with average crowds of more than 43,000.Italy's Serie A remains some way behind the German and Spanish leagues in terms of revenues, with France's Ligue 1 remaining the smallest of the Big Five leagues."
business	Uber posts $1bn loss weeks after stock market listing	'Long journey'Short sellers	"Uber has posted a $1bn (£790m) loss as the ride-hailing firm delivered its first figures since a disappointing flotation earlier this month.The quarterly loss came despite a 20% rise in revenues to $3.1bn and increase in monthly active users to 93 million.The results were in line with many analysts' forecasts and may provide reassurance about the company's future profitability.Uber shares have sunk almost 11% since it listed on Wall Street on 10 May.The company is the biggest of a group of Silicon Valley start-ups that have gone public this year against the backdrop of a global stock market sell-off sparked by renewed US-China trade tensions.But Uber has also faced strong competition in the smartphone ride-hailing business, and incurred extra costs for signing up new drivers and establishing the Uber Eats delivery service.Finance Chief Nelson Chai said he had recently seen some less aggressive pricing by competitors, which include arch rival Lyft.He added that Uber was prepared to keep spending. ""We will not hesitate to invest to defend our market position globally.""The company has ambitions to move into electric scooters, e-bikes, and even aircraft, allowing people to hail rides via their smartphones.During a conference call after publication of the results, Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said the company's disappointing start as a public business was just a step on ""the long journey of making Uber a platform for the movement of people and transport of commerce around the world at a massive scale"".The share price was almost flat in after-hours trading immediately following release of the numbers, but then jumped 1.6% higher before falling back.Some analysts have expressed unease about the company ever making a profit. The number of investors betting that Uber's share price will fall - called short-selling - has risen during the past two weeks.One analyst, Atlantic Equities' James Cordwell, said a lack of any forward guidance in Thursday's statement ""is a little disappointing""."
business	Superdry warns worse to come as profits plunge		"Superdry, best known for its coats and hoodies, has warned of weaker than expected profits, saying shoppers have not bought extra winter layers this year.It now expects annual profits of between £55m and £70m - analysts had been expecting around £84m.The announcement hit Superdry's shares and they closed more than 38% lower.The company is considering closing stores as part of a cost cutting drive to save £50m by 2022.""Superdry had a difficult first half, impacted by unseasonably warm weather across our major markets, a consumer economy that is increasingly discount driven and the issues we are addressing in product mix and range,"" said Euan Sutherland, Superdry's chief executive officer.Underlying profit before tax almost halved in the first half of the year, to £12.9m.The retailer is a third of the way through an 18-month strategy to re-energise the brand which includes introducing childrenswear and 100% organic cotton products.Mr Sutherland said the firm's ""over-reliance"" on jackets and sweatshirts was partly to blame for flagging sales.He will oversee an efficiency drive which will include reviewing the number and size of their stores, and exploring renegotiating rents between now and March 2019.Superdry's shares were down by as much as 30% on Wednesday. They have lost more than 70% of their value this year.Superdry became popular with teenagers by providing high quality sweatshirts and other casual wear with a Japanese-style branding. However it has been losing ground and was dubbed recently by the Financial Times as a brand ""for cool dads"".""It is a brand that hit a trend in the UK several years ago,"" said Maria Malone, from the Manchester Fashion Institute. ""Its customers are older, thirty plus, but the website features young models, this confuses the consumer.""The problem is that Superdry's products are neither high fashion nor very functional, and its style, reminiscent of American Classic or Gap, is ubiquitous, Ms Malone said.According to fashion retail analyst, Kate Hardcastle, the brand has saturated the market and has suffered from discount retailers producing copycat versions,""To stay fashionable and engage with a buyer a brand has to have an air of exclusivity about it,"" she said.Superdry's founder Julian Dunkerton left the board in March. Since then he has criticised the retailer's strategy.He said the company should focus on its core jackets and hoodies and offer a far wider range of variations online: ""Superdry is a series of core products - stick with them and tweak them,"" he said.As part of its new strategy Superdry has launched a ""fast-fashion"" range aimed at a ""younger, more fashion-driven"" customer. The range mimics online retailers in going from design to delivery to consumers in six weeks and is being marketed via social media."
business	All Mothercare UK stores to close	Pensions move'The only baby shop on the island'	"Troubled baby goods retailer Mothercare has called in administrators, putting 2,500 UK jobs at risk.There will be a phased closure of all of its 79 UK stores, administrators from PwC said.The UK firm ""has been loss-making for a number of years"", but international franchises are profitable, PwC said.On Monday the baby goods firm said it was ""not capable"" of being sufficiently profitable and that it had failed to find a buyer.Joint administrator Zelf Hussain said: ""This is a sad moment for a well-known High Street name,"" adding that Mothercare ""has been hit hard by increasing cost pressures and changes in consumer spending.""""It's with real regret that we have to implement a phased closure of all UK stores. Our focus will be to help employees and keep the stores trading for as long as possible,"" Mr Hussain said.Mothercare chairman Clive Whiley said there was ""deep regret and sadness that we have been unable to avoid the administration of Mothercare"" and that the board ""fully understand the significant impact on those UK colleagues and business partners who are affected"".He added: ""However, the board concluded that the administration processes serve the wider interests of ensuring a sustainable future for the company, including the wider group's global colleagues, its pension fund, lenders and other stakeholders.""Mothercare said it was in continuing talks over possible UK concession stores and about using the brand to sell goods online.It said it would move its pensions scheme across to its international business.Former Mothercare store manager Michelle Smith lost her job in October 2018 when her Isle of Wight store was one of 51 to close.She said she felt sorry for the people who will lose their jobs due to the administration.When her store closed, it was ""devastating"" for the Isle of Wight, she said.""My store was the only child and baby shop on the island,"" she said.While branded baby products can be cheaper online, a lot of people like to see, touch and feel products before buying them, she added.However, online retailers don't have the same overheads, she said.Michelle is now a store manager for Co-op.The administration will be ""disappointing for all the employees but it's not unexpected"", said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard.Since the firm negotiated a rescue deal with lenders last year, ""they haven't changed anything fundamentally"", she said.""The levels of investment needed to future-proof the business would have been so significant and they couldn't make that leap,"" she added.Ultimately, supermarkets and department stores ate into their market, plus cheaper online competitors, she said."
business	DHL could profit from no-deal Brexit, says boss	Trade stays	"The boss of the world's largest logistics firm says that his company could profit from a no-deal Brexit.Deutsche Post DHL's chief executive Frank Appel said in the long run Brexit would not benefit the UK or the EU.But he said the firm might profit in the short term from the disruption because ""our business is to manage complex situations"".DHL, which employs 54,000 people in the UK was ""starting to execute"" plans for a no-deal Brexit, he said.He added he would prefer not to focus on short term profits when the wider impact would be negative.Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Appel said he did not think a non-negotiated departure from the EU was ""a smart idea"" and he still hoped that an alternative solution would be found.He confirmed that no UK ministers had been in touch with the firm to talk through its preparedness for Brexit.Mr Appel also said he believed that trade tensions around the world would dissipate, and that goods and services would continue to move freely across borders.""There is no country that ever succeeded by being alone,"" Mr Appel warned. ""The world has become more global"".He cited the EU's recent trade deal with Japan, arguing that while trade wars make headlines, efforts to reduce regulatory barriers were continuing apace.The chief executive of Kuwaiti logistics firm Agility echoed these sentiments.Tarek Sultan, whose business in the UK has expanded rapidly, told the BBC that ""free trade is here to stay"".""It's not going to be reversed by the US government taking a hard line on trade agreements,"" he added.""The US China trade situation would only be detrimental to the global economy if it were to continue over the long term, but I don't see that happening."""
business	Thames Water leak woes hit profits		"Thames Water has reported a big fall in half-year profits, saying extreme weather has hindered its ability to fix leaks and overhaul its infrastructure.The company said the Beast from the East cold snap had caused pipes to burst, while the summer heatwave had brought supply problems.Underlying pre-tax profits fell by nearly half to £67.7m, from £129m a year earlier.It said the weather had had an ""enduring impact"" on leakage problems.The firm added that it had received 11,083 written complaints about supply interruptions in the six months to 30 September, up from 8,242 in the same period a year earlier.Chief executive Steve Robertson said: ""During the intense summer heatwave, we worked tirelessly to protect our customers from supply restrictions.""However, along with the impact of the Beast from the East, it has delayed our progress on leakage and other performance measures.""Since 2017, Thames Water has been fined more than £128m for poor management of leaks.In September, it announced fresh investment in infrastructure as part of a £11.7bn five-year plan.The future of the water industry has recently become a hot political issue, with Labour saying it will take it back into public ownership if elected.Water firms were sold off by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in 1989."
business	Minimum wage rises 'hit profits, not jobs'	Minimum wage ratesNational Living Wage v real living wage	"Employment levels have held up following a rise in minimum wage levels despite previous concerns raised by businesses, a report has said.However, prices have risen in some areas to cover the extra salary costs, according to the Low Pay Commission.Firms have accepted lower profits and restructured workforces, but think tanks have warned about the impact of future minimum wage rises.The National Living Wage for those aged 25 and over stands at £7.83 an hour.It will go up to £8.21 from next April. There are lower statutory minimum wages for younger workers, and a higher voluntary - but unofficial - living wage.When the National Living Wage was unveiled by the then-chancellor George Osborne in July 2015, there were concerns from business groups about the potential impact on jobs.The CBI business lobby group described the wage rise as a ""gamble"".The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents shops, said hundreds of thousands of jobs could go in the retail and hospitality sectors particularly. The former boss of Sainsbury's, Justin King, said that the National Living Wage would ""destroy jobs"".However, in its latest report on the impact of the rates that have been set, Low Pay Commission chairman Bryan Sanderson said: ""So far, the evidence suggests the National Living Wage has been successful in raising pay without causing unemployment, but employers have had to adjust in various ways.""He said that five million workers had received a pay rise in April who would not otherwise have done so without the National Living Wage.The Low Pay Commission recommends minimum wage levels to the government.The BRC said it welcomed the new 2019 rates, and pointed out that many employers paid above this level.Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, also said that the majority of small firms were paying all their staff more than £7.83 an hour before this became the minimum rate in April.""Of those who did see wage bills increase following April's rise, seven in 10 small business owners chose to reduce their profitability, absorbing those costs themselves. Roughly a third scaled-back or cancelled investment plans,"" he said.""The impact of a rising rate will vary from sector to sector. Labour-intensive industries with fine margins like childcare, hospitality and retail find increases harder to manage.""A report earlier this year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a rapid increase in the future level of the living wage could mean that more jobs were replaced by robots.With the hourly rate set to top £8.50 per hour by 2020, the think tank said more jobs may be at risk of automation."
business	Brexit 'puts brakes on UK launch of e-scooters'	Profitable	"Brexit is delaying the potential launch of public-use electric scooters in the UK, says Sweden's Voi Technology, which claims Britain risks being left behind.Fredrik Hjelm, co-founder and chief executive of the shared e-scooter firm, said he has held talks with the UK government about changing regulation.It is currently illegal in the UK to ride them on public roads or pavements.But Mr Hjelm said: ""What we hear and feel is that Brexit is a big reason why things are moving so slowly.""He added: ""We don't have any high hopes of getting this through before Brexit, which I think is sad, because most other European countries have been quite quick in adapting and trying to find a good regulatory framework.""Voi Technology is one of a growing number of businesses which have launched e-scooters in cities throughout Europe, the US and Asia.The company, which has only been operating since 2018, announced this week that it had raised $85m (£66m) from private investors.Its first funding round a year ago attracted $50m from the likes of Jeff Wilke, chief executive of Amazon's global consumer business, and Justin Mateen, co-founder of dating app Tinder.Many of these companies are vying to be the first to launch shared e-scooters - which can travel at speeds in excess of 30mph - in London.US firm Bird established the first legal electric scooter route in the UK this year at London's Olympic Park. It was able to do so because it is on private land.However, e-scooters are not without controversy. They have been involved in a number of traffic accidents, some of which have resulted in fatalities.Television presenter Emily Hartridge was riding an electric scooter when she was killed in a collision with a lorry in south London in July.France announced last month it was introducing rules to ensure e-scooters are only used by people aged 12 and upwards. The two-wheelers will also no longer be allowed on pavements there.France's junior Transport Minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said the new rules would encourage ""more responsible use... and restore a sense of tranquillity for pedestrians, in particular the most vulnerable: the elderly, children and handicapped people"".Most recently, Singapore banned scooters from all pavements and footpaths. From January, those caught breaking the rules can be fined and jailed for up to three months.Mr Hjelm said Voi is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure its e-scooters are safe by ""developing safer products, better brakes [and] better warning systems"".""But in the end, we are in the hands of users in the same way that a car rental company in the hands of their users, that they are driving the car in a safe and responsible way,"" he said.However, people who rent cars have driving licences after taking lessons and passing a test, whereas people who use e-scooters need no such qualifications.Despite launching as recently as 2018 - when it generated sales of between $1.5m and $2m - Voi is expected to report revenues in the ""tens of millions of dollars"" for this current financial year, said Mr Hjelm.He also forecasts that Voi, which is present in 38 cities across 10 European countries, will make a pre-tax profit by 2021-22.The company was set up by Mr Hjelm and Douglas Stark - the two met when they served as intelligence officers in Sweden's military - along with programmers Adam Jafer and Filip Lindvall.People who want to use Voi's e-scooters download the company's app, scan a barcode on the vehicle they want to ride and off they go.Once they are done, users tell the app their ride is over and take a photo to show that the e-scooter is parked in an orderly manner.One of the problems that France has faced by embracing the shared e-scooter is that many have been dumped or discarded, because unlike many shared bicycles for public use, they do not use a docking station.Mr Hjelm said: ""In the beginning, when we were going into the market, we lost more scooters when people are curious. They thought they could privatise them.""Mr Hjelm said that while there are disadvantages to using a traditional docking system - ""The dock station can be full and you have to go to another station that is not that convenient"" - he says Voi is moving towards a ""hybrid system"" with a mix of physical and virtual docks.Fortunately, the number of e-scooters being ""privatised"" has fallen and Mr Hjelm said that Voi has street teams in cities who ""make sure everything is in good order and parked in a nice way ""."
business	Tesla delivers 'historic' $311m profit		"Tesla has reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history.The electric car-maker made a record $311.5m (£241m) in the three months to 30 September, as the pace of car deliveries accelerated.The result is a victory for chief executive Elon Musk, who had promised a profit to investors earlier this year.Tesla's last profitable quarter came in 2016 and it had faced mounting questions about its finances.In a letter to investors, Mr Musk called the quarter ""historic"" and said it was a credit to the firm's ""ingenuity and incredible hard work"".He also said Tesla was on track to be profitable again in the fourth quarter.Shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading in New York.The results are a sign that the firm has turned a corner, said Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown.""Normally we'd tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter's numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla,"" he said.Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, had been under particular strain after it ramped up spending for its launch of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at a wider market.Following a surge of orders last year, it struggled to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers.That prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings.However, less than a fifth of the roughly 455,000 reservations the firm reported in 2017 have been cancelled, it said.Production has also picked up, driving sales. Tesla made more than 80,000 vehicles in the period, of which more than 60% were Model 3s.The increase lifted revenue to $6.8bn in the quarter, more than double a year ago.Job cuts and other reductions in spending also helped the bottom line.Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, called it a ""very strong"" quarterly performance.""Kudos to Elon Musk and team for surprising nearly everyone,"" he said. ""Now, the question remains - can Tesla make this a habit, or [is] this a blip on the radar?""On a call with financial analysts, Mr Musk said Tesla aimed to be profitable every quarter going forward.He is counting on strong demand in Europe and China, where Tesla plans to start selling Model 3s next year. The aim is to shift up to a million cars a year outside the US.Tesla hopes to start production of its next model in 2020 and is also making plans for a Tesla ride-hailing service, Mr Musk added.The quarterly profit milestone was a boost to the Tesla chief, who has been criticised for not delivering on previous promises and other recent behaviour, such as Twitter attacks on a British diver.Last month the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, accused him of defrauding investors when he claimed he had secured funding to take Tesla private.The two sides later announced a settlement, in which Mr Musk would step aside as chairman and pay a fine, among other penalties, but could remain Tesla chief executive.Tesla declined to take questions on the search for a new board chair."
business	Dr Martens' profits march forward	'Scope for growth'	"Strong sales in Europe and the Middle East have boosted profits at UK footwear firm Dr Martens.Earnings grew 33% to £50m in the year to March, with sales up 20% to £348.6m.The Northamptonshire-based company, most famous for its distinctive boots, said it had seen double-digit growth in revenues and profits in all regions.It started production in Northampton in 1960, and although most of its boots are now made overseas about 70,000 a year are still made at the UK factory.Dr Martens makes more than half of its revenues from its most recognisable product, the 1460 boot and sister product the 1461 shoe.The company said 40% of its revenues came from selling direct to consumers.Over the year the company, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, opened 25 new stores, including nine in the UK, giving it a total of 94 owned stores worldwide.The company said it had ""spotted"" a number of high-profile people sporting its wares, including David and Brooklyn Beckham, Kanye West, Pharrel Williams and Cardi B.Paul Mason, chairman of Dr Martens, said: ""This has been a fantastic year for Dr Martens."" He said there was still ""significant scope for growth across our markets, particularly via our Direct to Consumer channels, and this will remain a strategic priority in the years ahead"".In the past year the company appointed a new chief executive, Kenny Wilson, whose previous job was at the retro-style homeware and fashion brand, Kath Kidston.Dr Martens' air-cushioned sole was developed by Munich-based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck and the UK patent rights were sold to R Griggs Group.The footwear that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s.The boots also become popular with punks in the 1970s and had a resurgence when Britpop emerged in the 1990s."
business	Aldi plans to open a new supermarket each week	Queuing round the block'Long-term view''Double-edged sword'	"Aldi plans to open a new store in the UK every week on average for the next two years, its boss has told the BBC.Giles Hurley said the discount retailer would invest £1bn to achieve its aim.""The reality is that almost 50% of the population of the UK doesn't currently shop with us and they tell us the main reason for that is that they don't have a store near us,"" he said.Aldi's pledge came as it reported a sales rise for last year, but saw profits fall sharply.Last year, the company attracted more than 800,000 new customers, adding an extra £1.1bn in sales, up 11% on the previous twelve months. But most of this sales growth is from opening new stores.Profits for the same period fell 18%, partly due to price cuts aimed at keeping its competitive edge.Whilst the big established grocers are opening few, if any new stores, Aldi is still expanding, stealing their customers and growing market share. And that is set to continue.""Over the next two years we're going to invest a further billion pounds in the UK and that shows our intent,"" says Mr Hurley, Aldi's chief executive for the UK and Ireland.Aldi now has over 840 stores and is increasing its focus on London. It wants to double the number of stores inside the M25, from 45 to 100, by the end of 2025.""Within Greater London, our market share is around half of what it is in the rest of the country so there's clearly a big opportunity for us to expand the business. In the long term, we can comfortably see us opening 200-250 stores within London,"" says Mr Hurley.But will they be able to find enough locations to fit their low-cost business model?""It's not straightforward as you don't have the parking spaces,"" says Adam Leyland, editor of the Grocer magazine.""It's also harder to get good sites in London. So you have to have a very flexible model and Aldi is so formulaic as a discounter that this is harder to manage.""But they are determined to do it and they are a very capable grocer. We've seen over the years how they've responded to the dynamics of the UK market.""When Aldi opens a new store the shoppers come.Here in Ruabon, on the outskirts of Wrexham, customers were queuing round the block, lured by the promise of an early freebie.It felt like Black Friday had come early.The rush was on for the so called ""Aisle of Wonder"" - ""starbuys"" included a £24.99 cordless lawnmower and a cut price vacuum cleaner.Families were dragging six-seater wooden patio sets towards the tills. Another woman's trolley was filled with three Mr Potato Heads, four rabbit-shaped wicker planters and a wooden wishing well for her garden.The first customer, Ken Peters, had been waiting since 5:30am to get in: ""I'm hoping for a bargain, or a free food voucher,"" he says.Aldi is already experimenting with a new, smaller, convenience store format. There are currently eight Aldi ""Local"" stores in Greater London, including a former Waitrose store in Camden. Aldi thinks that figure could grow to as high as 50 in the longer term.So how long can this rapid expansion last?""The fundamental question for Aldi, Lidl and all the other discounters, like B&M, across the retail sectors is that at some point they will reach their peak physical space,"" says Patrick O'Brien, UK retail director at market research firm GlobalData.""The rate of growth they're enjoying isn't going to last forever.""So they're going to be in the same boat as their bigger rivals, going head to head for their share of the spend in their existing store estates, and as the discounters have expanded they are more often found in each other's catchment areas, competing with each other rather than the easier job of taking spend from higher priced rivals,"" he believes.But that's not something Aldi has to worry about right now when it's got years of growth ahead to manage, argues Mr Leyland.""Aldi are clearly performing very well. The crucial thing is that when they open a store people come. Aldi will only have a problem if it opens new stores and people aren't attracted to them and I can't see any evidence of that.""But the Big Four supermarket chains aren't making it easy. They've been improving their offer and trying to close the price gap with the discounters.Aldi's promise to keep prices lower took its toll on last year's profits. But Mr Hurley, is adamant that it's a promise he's prepared to keep:""Our profits did suffer as a result of the investments we made, but Aldi is not like other supermarkets. We take a very long-term view of our business and the focus is very much on our sales, our customers and our store numbers and not on short term profitability.""The plans we put down last year were carefully considered. We've always said that we will offer the lowest prices in the market,"" he says.The biggest challenge right now for all the UK's grocers is Brexit.So does Aldi believe there will be gaps on the shelves in the event of a disorderly no deal?""I can't guarantee the availability of every single product,"" says Mr Hurley.""But actually that's no different from anyone else. What we will do is shield our customers from as many ripple effects as possible. I can't commit that prices won't go up. I'm not alone in the industry on that but what I can guarantee is that customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices with Aldi.""Mr Hurely said the chain was working ""very closely"" with its supply base.""Because of our select range of products that's probably a little easier than some of our competitors.""We also believe we're in a solid position because 75% of what we sell comes from British suppliers and manufacturers"", he says.Aldi is increasing stocks in items like olive oil, tinned tomatoes and pasta, items which aren't produced in the UK.Brexit, says the Grocer's Mr Leyland, is Aldi's biggest worry right now.""It's the biggest challenge for the whole food industry at the moment. Everyone is working crazily to come up with solutions.""Aldi may have fewer products to worry about but it's a double-edged sword because if one product isn't getting through it's harder to flex it. And although they're very competitive, they've struggled to manage inflation like everyone else.""Whatever happens, Aldi is clear that Brexit won't change its expansion plans.This business, along with Lidl, has had a profound effect on the UK grocery market.Aldi alone took £7bn of sales in the last year that would otherwise have gone to its rivals, according to the research, data and insight consultancy, Kantar.As long as it is continuing to open new stores, it's likely to be a hugely disruptive force."
business	Royal Mail profits more than halve	Performance pledge	"Half-year profits at Royal Mail have tumbled after the company failed to cut costs as quickly as hoped.Pre-tax profit more than halved to £33m for the six months to 23 September despite a 1% rise in revenues to just over £4.9bn.Revenue from its GLS European parcel operations was up 9%, offsetting a 1% fall in the UK parcels and letters.Chief executive Rico Back said Royal Mail had put a ""range of actions"" in place to improve performance.""There will be a greater emphasis on how we connect customers, companies and countries through our domestic and international businesses. There will be a clearer focus on financial performance and management accountability,"" he said.Growth in online shopping helped drive a 6% rise in revenues for the UK parcels business, but total revenue from letters was down 7%. Adjusted pre-tax profit was down 27% to £183m.Royal Mail warned on profits at the start of October in an unscheduled update after revealing that cost savings would be just £100m this year rather than the £230m forecast, sending shares down almost a fifth.The company reiterated its commitment to the £100m target for the 2018-19 financial year and Mr Back said the management team was ""focused on pulling all the short and medium-term levers at our disposal to improve our performance"".It said it would update investors on its strategy in March next year.""This is a great company with great brands. We have, by far, the best delivery network in the UK: our ability to deliver most of our letters and parcels together is a major asset,"" said Mr Back, who took over from Moya Green as chief executive earlier this year.""Royal Mail has been in existence in one form or another for over 500 years. We have transformed ourselves many times before.""However, analysts at Liberum said the firm faced ""significant structural challenges with little visibility on how the business might be turned around"".They maintained a ""sell"" recommendation on the shares with a target price of just 250p.After initially rising, Royal Mail's shares fell 3% to 338p on Thursday.The shares have nearly halved since peaking at 632p in May, prompting some Royal Mail staff to claim they have been short-changed.Some 145,000 postal workers have waited five years to sell the free shares they were given at the time of privatisation without being taxed.The shares were priced at 330p when the company floated."
business	Flybe shares sink on profit warning		"Flybe shares have fallen more than a third after issuing a profit warning, blaming poor demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs.The airline said in a trading update it now expects a full-year pre-tax loss of £22m before - far higher than analysts had expected.It has taken a £29m hit from weak sterling and a rise in fuel prices.However, the overall loss would be closer to £12m due to a £10m windfall from ending an onerous lease.In June the Exeter-based airline reported an annual pre-tax loss of £19.2m, which it blamed on poor winter weather, a major IT overhaul and additional maintenance costs.Christine Ourmieres-Widener, chief executive of Flybe, said the market had softened in recent weeks after passenger revenue per seat rose 6.8% over the summer period.""We are reviewing further capacity and cost-saving measures. Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,"" she said.""We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.""Peter Morris, an aviation economist with FlightGlobal, argued that the UK economy has affected Flybe's performance this year.""Given that the pound is weakening and they've got to buy their fuel and leases in dollars, you've got a challenge where your revenues are either fixed or declining, and your costs are rising,"" he told the BBC.There was a market for Flybe in taking passengers to and from secondary UK cities to destinations across Europe, and opportunities in providing contract flying to other airlines, Mr Morris said.However, Flybe was ""sandwiched"" between the business model of budget airlines such as Ryanair, and the network carriers like British Airways that use short-haul flights to connect with long-haul services.""For example, it might fly from Southampton to Amsterdam, but it's not a major trunk route, so it doesn't have enough corporate flyers. But if it gets to a critical mass, then low cost airlines will join in and fly those routes at lower costs,"" Mr Morris said. ""If you are successful, either group will come after you.""However, Flybe would first need to weather the winter period, where demand was typically the lowest, he warned.Shares fell 11.8p to 20.3p in morning trading, valuing the firm at just £68m.Flybe has 78 planes, two fewer than at the end of March.Its interim results will be issued on 14 November."
business	Deutsche Bank to cut more than 7,000 jobs		"Deutsche Bank has said it will cut more than 7,000 jobs as Germany's biggest lender attempts to return to profit.The bank said it would reduce global staffing levels from just over 97,000 to ""well below 90,000"".Following a review of the business, the number of jobs in Deutsche's equities sales and trading business is being cut by a quarter.The bank - which employs 8,500 people in the UK - did not say which countries would be affected by the job cuts.Deutsche Bank employs about 66,000 people in Europe - including 42,000 in Germany, 21,000 in Asia and about 10,000 in North America.The bank had already flagged up that job cuts were on the way last month, with chief executive Christian Sewing saying at the time that they would be ""painful but regrettably unavoidable"".On Thursday, Mr Sewing said: ""We remain committed to our Corporate & Investment Bank and our international presence - we are unwavering in that.""We are Europe's alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.""The job cuts are the first major move by Mr Sewing, who took up the role last month after his predecessor, John Cryan, was sacked.The search for his replacement is understood to have begun after the bank reported an annual loss of €500m (£438m) at the end of February. That followed losses of €1.4bn in 2016, and €6.8bn in 2015 after restructuring and litigation costs.The job cut announcement came ahead of Deutsche Bank's annual shareholder meeting.At the meeting, the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, said that while Mr Cryan had ""set the ball rolling"" on reform, he had displayed ""shortcomings in decision-making and implementation"".""You are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,"" he said. ""If there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively.""Deutsche Bank's share price is currently trading at just below €11, down more than a third from 2017's high of €17.57. Before the financial crisis of 2007-08 the bank's shares hit a peak of €91."
business	DFS profits hit by summer heatwave	Recovery signs?Heatwave effects	"Sofa and living room furniture specialist DFS has seen annual profits cut in half after the summer heatwave hit sales.The firm, founded in 1969, said it had experienced an ""exceptional downturn"" in consumer demand over summer.Profit for the year to 28 July fell 48.5% to £25.8m, but revenues rose helped by its purchase of Sofology.DFS expects the market to be ""subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment"".As well as hot weather issues, shipments of made-to-order products from the Far East were hit by delays at Felixstowe port.The docks have been thrown into turmoil after a new terminal operating system hit problems.This has caused delays in delivering items to customers, which is when DFS records the sale on its books.""Financial results for the year reflected the exceptional downturn in market demand we saw in the fourth quarter,"" said chief executive Ian Filby.""We are pleased to note that the market has recovered since the start of the new financial year, with the group seeing like-for-like order growth across all brands over the first nine weeks.""We believe, however, we are benefiting from deferred purchases in the prior financial year and overall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment.""On a brighter note, group revenue, which included income from recent purchase Sofology, rose by 14.1% to £870.5m, while online sales jumped 15.1%.The heatwave has been cited for affecting - adversely or positively - the trading results of a number of firms and business sectors.Clothing firm Next reported better-than-expected sales over the summer, but suit company Moss Bros blamed the hot weather for disappointing trading.The weather also spurred people into splashing out on fans, food and drink.However, in August food inflation jumped to a seven-month high of 1.9% after the heatwave hit crop yields."
business	Bonmarché shares sink on profit warning	'Challenging times'	"Shares in womenswear chain Bonmarché fell 18% on Thursday after warning that profits would fall short due to weak consumer demand and warm weather.The retailer said online sales had grown strongly in the second quarter of the year, but sales in stores had not kept up the pace of the first quarter.Full-year profits are now expected to be £5.5m, down from £8m last year.The Wakefield-based chain has more than 300 stores and a membership of 1.7 million for its loyalty scheme.Many retailers are struggling in the current trading environment, with several well-known chains closing stores and seeking a financial restructuring to survive.Department store group House of Fraser was bought by Sports Direct after running into difficulties, and earlier this month Debenhams rushed out a statement to try to reassure investors over its finances.Last week. menswear chain Moss Bros issued a profit warning, also citing the summer's hot weather as a factor for poor trading.However, not all retailers are in trouble. Earlier this week, fashion chain Next reported better-than-expected sales.In its latest trading statement, Bonmarché said: ""The continuation of warm weather for an extended period may have delayed demand for early autumn stock, but we believe that the more dominant factor is that underlying consumer demand for the UK High Street is weaker which is impacting footfall.""It had given an upbeat trading statement in July, in which it said trading had been ""significantly better"" than in the previous quarter, but trading since then has deteriorated.Helen Connolly, the company's chief executive, said: ""These are undoubtedly challenging times in the retail industry and, in common with many other businesses, Bonmarché's store trading has been impacted by weaker consumer sentiment and footfall.""However, she added that despite the ""challenging market, the health of the business remains strong"".Bonmarché, established in 1982, describes itself as ""one of the UK's largest women's value retailers"".Shares ended 19p lower at 84p, valuing the company at £43m."

business	Ted Baker shares plunge 35% as sales slide		"Shares in fashion retailer Ted Baker have plunged 35% after it posted a loss and said trading remained tough.The firm, which issued a profits alert in June and whose founder Ray Kelvin resigned in March, blamed fierce competition and unseasonable weather.Its comments came as it reported a £23m loss for the six months to 10 August, down from a £24.5m profit last year.Chairman David Bernstein said if things did not improve, second-half profits would also be below last year's.""Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition,"" Mr Bernstein said.Sales in the first half were down across every region the company operates in, including a 3.9% fall in the UK and Europe to £141.3m. North America was down 3.1% and the rest of the world down 15.2%. Online sales also fell by 1.3% to £52.3m, although the company's wholesale business was up 4% to £89.3m.In June, Ted Baker's shares lost more than a quarter of their value after the firm warned investors to expect a fall in first-half profits. It blamed ""unseasonable weather"" across North America and heavy discounting.These conditions are continuing Mr Bernstein said. ""Trading in the second half has started slowly, not helped by the unseasonably warm weather in September, and this will have an impact on the full year outcome. If these trends continue, we will achieve a second half result below that of last year.""Emily Salter, retail analyst at Global Data, said it was worrying that online sales had also fallen, which meant that Ted Baker could not solely blame problems on the High Street.The online arm had previously performed well, she said, adding: ""This points to more significant problems with demand for the brand and the impacts of regular discounting.""The trading problems are the latest setback for the firm after Mr Kelvin left in March following harassment allegations.Mr Kelvin, who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988, resigned over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". He has denied all allegations of misconduct."
business	Cruise and hotel bookings boost Tui profits for fourth year		"A rise in hotel and cruise bookings has helped European travel group Tui sail through another year with more than 10% growth in profits.It said next year, profits would grow a similar amount as customers also bought more excursions and holiday activities.Tui has seen double-digit growth for the last four years.Last month, smaller UK rival Thomas Cook reported a loss of £163m, blaming warmer summer weather for lower numbers of bookings.""Our own holiday experiences content accounts for more than 70% of our earnings: hotels, cruises, excursions and destination activities. This enables us to clearly differentiate ourselves from the competition,"" said Fritz Joussen, Tui's chief executive.Tui Group posted a 10.9% rise in annual earnings, just ahead of analysts' forecasts. The share price rose 5.5% following the news.Tui said the ""challenging market"", including uncertainty from Brexit and tough competition between airlines, had squeezed consumer spending. Earnings were nearly 15% lower for the group's tour operator and airline business.But there was strong growth in demand for cruises, hotels and holiday ""experiences"", which together account for 70% of Tui's earnings. The firm said customers were paying more for extra activities while at their holiday destination, such as jungle trails, city tours and cultural experiences.The firm's spokesman said the firm was benefiting from more targeted marketing of in-holiday extras, such as room upgrades and tailored excursions.While in the past, a holiday rep might have offered the same range of activities to everyone in the hotel lobby on the first day of a holiday, they were now offering more targeted suggestions to customers during the period between booking and travelling.He said the recent acquisition of Italian technology firm Musement was allowing Tui to use AI to market bespoke excursions, such as a French-language tour of the Colliseum for a specific date booked months ahead.David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said that the results amounted to a ""very respectable set of full-year figures"", with this winter's trading nearly matching last year's level and an increase in the dividend going to shareholders.""Given what has gone on in the travel sector lately, it was an impressive performance from Tui,"" he said.""Thomas Cook and Ryanair both issued profit warnings and Flybe have put themselves up for sale - so the sector is clearly under pressure."""
business	Barclays profits up 'despite Brexit uncertainty'		"Profits at Barclays surged in the third quarter as the lender's investment banking and retail divisions picked up speed.The lender posted £1.5bn in profit before tax for the three months to 30 September, up from £1.1bn a year ago.Boss Jes Staley said the bank was doing well, despite Brexit uncertainty ""weighing heavily on market sentiment"".Income at Barclays' markets trading business grew by 19% to £1.2bn, during the quarter.The strong quarterly results will be welcome after a bumpy first half of the year, which saw Barclays' profits hit by litigation costs and settlements.Also, in March, it emerged that Edward Bramson, an investor know for shaking up companies, had taken a 5% stake in the bank. He has been pushing for higher returns from the investment bank and bigger payouts for shareholders.Barclays group profits for the first nine months of the year fell compared with the same period last year, after it paid a £1.4bn penalty in the US over mis-selling financial products before 2008.Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""Although the bank is striving to consign these charges to history, investors will be relieved when they cease to become an important part of the narrative.""However, he said Barclays' fortunes were improving and its latest update was ""one of promise"".Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the lender still faced challenges.""These latest results don't really change the big picture at Barclays. Progress has been made, though it's come in fits and starts, and we'd like to see greater consistency in its performance."""
business	Flybe up for sale weeks after profit warning	Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter	"Flybe has put itself up for sale, just weeks after issuing a profit warning.The Exeter-based regional airline's board confirmed it was ""in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale of the company"".Flybe said it was also reviewing other ""strategic options"", including cutting more flights in the face of challenges.A spokesman for the airline said there was no threat to tickets and flights that had already been purchased as a result of the review.Last month, the airline warned full-year losses would be £22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs.Latest results, published on Wednesday, show that pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 September fell by 54% to £7.4m, on revenues down by 2.4% to £419.2m.The airline's shares have fallen by almost 75% since September.The Exeter-based airline is now valued at about £25m, far below the £215m it was valued at when it floated on the stock exchange in 2010.However, following the announcement of the review, shares leapt by 37%.Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, told the BBC Flybe had ""suffered from weaker consumer demand, which is typical for operators of regional airports and have also blamed Brexit uncertainty and a weaker pound unsurprisingly"".He says that ""the usual suspects"" are in the frame as potential buyers of the regional airline.""I saw a hint of Stobart Group, the owner of Southend Airport, as a possible rescuer. BA, historically of course, had a share [in Flybe] and sold it. So we are looking for more details.""Stobart Group and BA-owner IAG refused to comment.In a series of tweets the British Airline Pilots' Association said Flybe's 2,300 ""talented, committed"" staff in the UK would be ""very worried to hear... that their company is up for sale"".Balpa said it believed Flybe was ""fundamentally a sound airline"" and that it would scrutinise any offers for the firm to ensure jobs were protected.It also said it expected to be consulted by Flybe and potential bidders over any future plans they had for the airline and its employees.Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe.It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from a costly IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs.Last month, Flybe's chief executive, Christine Ourmieres-Widener, said it was reviewing ""further capacity and cost-saving measures"".""Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,"" she said at the time.Flybe says its decision to put itself up for sale is due to the ""current challenges"" it faces - higher fuel prices, uncertain demand and a weaker pound.In truth, those problems are just the icing on the cake. The sale is in reality the culmination of a series of management missteps over the last decade as the company struggled to find a profitable niche.It was squeezed from below by smaller, more nimble rivals, and from above by the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair.Flybe has tried new aircraft - Embraer jets that eventually had to be got rid of at immense cost - and new routes - forays away from its regional base to Heathrow and London City airports - without ever finding the magic formula that would let it survive as an independent airline.All the while, cash has flowed out the door. Today's half-year results show a net outflow of more than £30m, leaving the company with just £52.4m in cash reserves.The accounts show that credit card acquirers, vital trade partners for airlines, are asking for more security. They also reveal departures of senior management: Vincent Hodder, head of strategy, and Peter Hauptvogel, the chief information officer, have recently left.All these management mistakes have been funded by Flybe's long-suffering shareholders. It floated in 2010 at 295p a share and raised £150m from investors in 2014. The shares currently trade at 11p."
business	Walmart rises despite lower profit forecast	Leaning long-termSales forecast	"Walmart is asking Wall Street to wait for profit growth as it battles to retain its place as the world's largest retailer.The US discount chain has been buying up smaller companies, investing in India and spending on new technology.But the investments come at a cost.On Tuesday, the firm warned that profits per share would decline slightly next year, largely because of losses at its Indian e-commerce unit Flipkart.Despite the caution, the firm's shares rose by nearly 2%, offering a vote of confidence in Walmart's efforts to remake its business.Executives outlined plans to investors at an annual meeting on Tuesday.They said they were looking at everything from introducing more robots to cut costs to expanding revenue by monetising customer data.In its stores, Walmart is expanding offerings in categories with strong sales, such as wine and toys.Online, executives said they wanted to improve services such as same-day delivery and increase the number of products available.""I like the direction we're heading, but it's not going to happen overnight,"" said Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart's US e-commerce unit.Walmart has already been on a shopping spree, purchasing online shopping site Jet.com, as well as brands such as Bonobos and Bare Necessities to strengthen its digital muscle.It spent $16bn (£12.1bn) this year to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company.Executives said they believed that Flipkart will turn profitable eventually, but conceded that the investment, as well as others it is making, would be costly in the short-term.""We want to be positioned to have a business that's large and growing for the long term,"" said chief executive Doug McMillon.""I'm trying to balance short-term and long-term but if you force me to choose, I'd lean long-term.""The firm expects sales to increase by at least 3% in its next financial year, excluding fluctuations due to currency changes.In the US, the firm expects sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, helped by a 35% surge in online shopping.However, profits are expected to decline in the low single digits. The firm's estimate includes Flipkart, but not other changes, such as tax rates.Executives said a healthy US economy had helped power sales, but they were preparing for the possibility that consumers will pull back.The firm is also facing rising labour and delivery costs, as well as new US tariffs on Chinese imports.Executives said the firm was committed to remaining the ""low price leader"" and had been in intense talks with suppliers in an effort to avoid raising prices."
business	Footasylum shares plunge on profit warning	'Sold a pup'	"Shares in Footasylum plunged on Monday after the ""athleisure"" retailer warned on profits following difficult trading in July and August.Despite reporting a 18.5% rise in sales to £98.6m for the six months to 25 August, Footasylum said sales since then had been ""more challenging"".There was ""no sign of a recovery"" on the high street, the retailer said.As a result, adjusted annual profits will be ""significantly lower"" than previous guidance"".Footasylum expected to post less than half the £12.5m it made in the last financial year, according to an unscheduled trading update.Barry Bown, executive chairman, said: ""These are undoubtedly challenging times in the retail industry and, in common with many other businesses, Footasylum's trading has continued to be impacted by weak consumer sentiment.""It also blamed ""some unforeseen delays"" in opening new stores and a hit to margins from more clearance activity.Shares more than halved to 40p, leaving the company valued at about £42m.It was the second time this year that shares in Footasylum, which listed on the junior AIM market in November, have collapsed.In June the firm said profits would be hit by higher investment in its stores this year.Retail analyst Nick Bubb said the second warning confirmed his fears that ""investors were sold a pup"" when the company floated last year.Analysts at Liberum said downgrading its outlook for the second time this year was ""highly disappointing"" and the rest of the current financial year was ""likely to be difficult"".""The group should hopefully start to see the benefits from some of the initiatives laid out by the executive chairman, but these take time to deliver,"" they added.Footasylum aims to more than double the number of UK stores to about 150 as well as expand outlets in prime locations and boost its online offering.The woes affecting the high street have resulted in the closure of hundreds of shops and restaurants run by a handful of major chains this year."
business	Royal Mail shares plunge on profit warning		"Royal Mail shares ended 18% lower on Monday after it warned on profits in an unscheduled trading update.The post and parcel firm said cost savings would be just £100m this year rather than the £230m forecast.Addressed letter volume fell by 7% in the first half of the year, while productivity performance was ""significantly below plan"".Adjusted operating profit before transformation costs would be between £500m and £550m as a result.That is significantly lower than the £694m posted last year.Shares fell 85.7p to 391.4p after the trading update was issued an hour before the London market closed.Chief executive Rico Back trading conditions in the UK were ""challenging"", with the number of letters posted - particularly marketing mail - affected by ""ongoing structural decline, business uncertainty and GDPR"".In June, Royal Mail said there was some uncertainty among its customers about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes new requirements on how companies collect and process personal information about EU citizens and came into force on 25 May.The company said its UK productivity growth had been disappointing, rising just 0.1% - far below the 2% to 3% target - despite no strikes being held by workers during the six months to 23 September.However, Mr Back said the UK parcels business was performing well with revenue and volume up 6% in the first half.""We remain focused on delivering parcel revenue growth and pursuing our strategy of targeted and focused acquisitions, through GLS, in growing markets,"" he said.GLS is one of Europe's largest parcel delivery firms, covering 41 countries as well as eight states in the Western US and in Canada.Helal Miah, an analyst at The Share Centre, said the recently appointed Mr Back appeared to be ""throwing out the 'baby with the bath water' so he can begin his tenure with a clean slate"".Neil Wilson at Markets.com said it was a ""really horrible profits warning"", but described the fall in the shares that wiped £1bn off Royal Mail's value as ""excessive""."
business	Is plant burger firm Beyond Meat really worth $1.5bn?	Beyond delicious?	"Beyond Meat has lifted its share price range ahead of its US flotation this week, valuing the plant-based meat-maker at nearly $1.5bn (£1.1bn).The US firm, which counts actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio among its investors, will now offer its shares at between $23 and $25.The decision to increase the price from the original range of $19 and $21 indicates strong demand for the shares.But Beyond Meat is loss-making and does not know when it will report a profit.For its most recent financial results for 2018, Beyond Meat said losses hit $29.9m, slightly below the previous year but above a $25.1m loss in 2016.Beyond Meat said it has reported losses since it was founded in 2009 due to its investment in ""innovation and growth"".In its flotation document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it said: ""We may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.""We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception and we may therefore not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.""By Dearbail Jordan, business reporter in New YorkFirst a disclaimer: I haven't eaten meat for 30 years which makes me either the worst person possible or the ideal candidate to try a meatless Beyond Burger.I find one on the menu at TGI Fridays in Manhattan where, interestingly, the waitress who takes my order makes sure I realise that the beef-like patty is plant-based and not made of meat.Her question flies in the face of Beyond Meat's strategy - the company that makes the burger - which asks retailers to stock its products alongside real meat so it is seen as an option for all consumers, not just vegans and vegetarians.Also striking is the calorie count.A Beyond Burger with cheese in a bun with all the trimmings is a gut-busting 890 calories, just below TGI Friday's traditional cheeseburger which is 1,110 calories, proving that just because something is meat-free doesn't mean it's virtuous.The Beyond Burger itself does look like meat - it is slightly pink in the middle and actually has char marks on the outside, like it has been sizzling on a grill.It's also surprisingly tasty and filling. The texture is fine and it doesn't have that rubbery consistency that other non-meat alternatives have.Afterwards, however, I feel slightly bilious. It could be because the burger is so meat-like it makes me feel odd. Yet it doesn't put me off trying its other products which include beef-like mince, to perhaps recreate my Mum's legendary spaghetti Bolognese.But whether there are enough people out there ready to try Beyond Meat's products to justify that $1.5bn market valuation ahead of its stock market flotation on Wednesday remains to be seen.Beyond Meat is one of a number of so-called ""unicorn"" companies - which are privately-backed firms worth $1bn or more - to sell their shares to public investors this year.Despite attracting high valuations, the majority of unicorn companies that have floated this year, or intend to, have yet to make a profit.This week, the We Company, owner of shared office provider WeWork, filed paperwork with the SEC to enable it to float. It has a private valuation of around $47bn but its most recent losses doubled to $1.9bn.Uber, the ride-sharing and food delivery business, is currently on a road show to visit potential investors and drum up support for its flotation in May. It has set its share price range at between $44 and $50 each, valuing it at as much as $90bn but it is also yet to make a profit.Beyond Meat, which makes burgers and plant-based minced meat like products, is counting on both meat eaters as well as vegetarians and vegans to grow its business.It estimates that the global meat industry is worth as much as $1.4 trillion.Sales rose to $87.9m last year from $32.6m in the previous 12 months and $16.2m in 2016.As well as Mr DiCaprio, Beyond Meat also counts Microsoft founder Bill Gates among its backers. The company will sell its shares on the New York Stock Exchange."
business	Thomas Cook blames heatwave for profit warning		"Thomas Cook shares fell as much as 25% after it blamed the summer heatwave for a drop in its annual profit forecast.""Many customers"" had put off booking holidays abroad, instead staying at home in June and July to enjoy the sunshine, the holiday firm said.The company said this had led to ""higher than usual levels of discounting"" in August and September.It now expects full-year earnings of £280m, below its earlier forecast of around £323m, which it made in July.In a separate statement, Thomas Cook also said it would replace its chief financial officer.The share price has halved in value since the start of the year.Thomas Cook usually makes all of its annual profits during the summer.But it also warned that the impact of the heatwave ""is continuing to be felt into winter trading"".""A downgrade of this size in 2018 is going to have some impact on 2019,"" chief executive Peter Fankhauser told investors.Thomas Cook said a return in popularity of holidays to Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Greece meant that total group bookings for the summer period were 12% higher than the same period last year.However, average selling prices were 5% lower than last year.Mr Fankhauser admitted its trading performance was ""disappointing"", but said the firm had made ""good strategic progress which positions us well to driver further performance improvement"".The firm warned in July that annual earnings would be at the lower end of market expectations due to more people staying at home rather than booking last-minute holidays.Shore Capital analyst Greg Johnson said assuming a normal trading environment going forward he expected ""some of this year's shortfall to be recovered, although the winter is likely to be tougher"".He downgraded his rating on the shares from ""buy"" to ""hold"" ""until we get greater clarity over trading for Summer 2019"".Patricia Yates, the director of Visit Britain, told the BBC earlier this year that there was a growing trend towards more late bookings, with nearly 80% of all trips being booked within three months of the travel date.The hot weather in the UK therefore acts as a ""timely reminder"" to people who are ""making a late-call on where to go on holiday"", she said.In August, Thomas Cook's bigger rival Tui Group reiterated its full-year profit forecast, but said the heatwave meant it was unlikely to exceed its profit prediction.Meanwhile, Thomas Cook's chief financial officer Bill Scott will leave the company at the end of November, and be replaced on an interim basis by Sten Daugaard, a board member of the company's German business.A search for a permanent successor would start immediately, the company added."
business	Ryanair profits hit by strikes and higher fuel costs	'Worrying effect'	"Strikes by air traffic controllers and Ryanair pilots and cabin crew have contributed to a slide in half-year profits over the summer.The airline reported a 7% fall in profits to €1.2bn (£1.06bn) for the six months to 30 September.Profits were also hit by higher fuel costs and what Michael O'Leary called ""the worst summer of ATC [air traffic control] disruptions on record"".However, traffic rose 6% and its planes were 96% full.Average fares slipped 3% to €46, but ancillary revenues - such as luggage and seat reservation fees - jumped 27% to €1.3bn.After many years of ignoring workers' attempts to get it to recognise unions, Ryanair finally agreed to do so at the end of 2017.However, continuing rows over working conditions led to the airline being hit by a wave of industrial action over the summer by staff in several European countries.Mr O'Leary said the strikes had had little impact on its schedules and that rivals such as Air France and Lufthansa had been hit harder by industrial action this summer.However, Neil Wilson at Markets.com said strikes were having a ""worrying effect on customer confidence ... in Ryanair, as evidenced by the weak forward bookings. Progress has been made on securing deals with unions but there is a lot of work to do still.""Rising oil prices have also bumped up Ryanair's fuel bill, eating into profits. The carrier spent €1.3bn on fuel in the first half of the year, up 22% from a year earlier.Earlier this month, Ryanair warned that profits for the full year would be 12% lower than previously forecast at between €1.1bn and €1.2bn. It reported a record €1.45bn profit after tax for the year to 31 March.""This full-year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further - they remain soft this winter due to excess capacity in Europe - [and] the impact of significantly higher oil prices,"" Mr O'Leary added.Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, said Ryanair's margins were being squeezed by lower average fares and higher fuel and staff costs, but remained at industry-leading levels. ""We do not see these being fundamentally undermined by the move to recognise unions,"" he added.A number of airlines have collapsed in recent weeks, including Primera Air and Cobalt, and Mr Wilson said Ryanair remained ""very well placed to capitalise on the inevitable and long overdue consolidation in the sector"".He added: ""Consolidation should ultimately be good for Ryanair, but it's a turbulent ride at the moment.""Mr O'Leary told Bloomberg that he hoped that more smaller airlines failed ""because they deserve to disappear"".He predicted a ""very, very difficult winter"" for some airlines and also questioned the viability of rivals such as Norwegian, which was paying $85 a barrel for fuel compared with Ryanair's $68.The controversial boss also dismissed the prospect of a no-deal Brexit because it would mean flights being grounded on 1 April - the day after the UK is due to leave the European Union. Such a prospect would cause the government to fall, Mr O'Leary said.Shares in Ryanair have fallen by 40% since their peak of almost €20 last August before the strike action began. Its shares rose 3.6% to €11.86 in early trading in London on Monday.The airline came under fire over the weekend for apparently failing to remove a passenger from a flight after he racially abused a woman in her 70s."
business	GM strike ends after UAW workers approve deal		"The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has called an end to its strike with General Motors after a majority of members approved a new contract.The strike had halted work at US factories for six weeks, costing the carmaker an estimated $2bn (£1.5bn).The new four-year agreement covers almost 50,000 workers, providing pay increases, bonuses and a path to permanent jobs for temporary staff.The strike was the longest in the car industry since 1970.UAW vice-president Terry Dittes, who worked on the negotiations, said the walkout had been critical to the gains.""We are all so incredibly proud of UAW-GM members who captured the hearts and minds of a nation,"" he said.The strike started on 16 September, after the union's previous four-year contract with GM expired. It was the first stoppage since 2007, when there was a two-day walkout.The contract, which won 57% of the UAW member vote, provides for 3% wage increases, maintains the current health benefits and removes a cap on profit-sharing with employees.It also includes a signing bonus and creates a ""clear path"" to permanent staff status for temporary employees who have worked for the company for three years.In a statement, General Motors, which earned $8bn in profit last year, called the package ""world-class"". It also noted the firm's planned to invest $7.7bn in the US.""GM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the US,"" chief executive Mary Barra said.The union had also been fighting to stop GM from shutting US plants but those closures will go ahead as announced.GM has agreed to invest in upgrades in the fourth, located in Detroit.GM has said the cuts are a necessary response to slowing car sales, the industry shift to electric and autonomous vehicles and other market changes.The UAW said it would negotiate next with Ford."
business	Moss Bros shares dive on profit warning	Footfall 'dropped dramatically'	"Shares in Moss Bros have fallen sharply after the menswear retailer reported disappointing results, with sales being hit by the hot summer weather and the ""distraction"" of the World Cup.Its shares fell by almost 30% at one point as it also warned that full-year profits would be lower than expected.Moss Bros reported a pre-tax loss of £1.7m for the six months to 28 July, down from a profit of £3.9m last year.Revenues for the six months fell by 3.3% to £64.5m.Like-for-like retail sales, including e-commerce, dropped 6.9%.The company's chief executive, Brian Brick, said trading during the period had been ""one of the most volatile for many years"".After fixing ""supply chain issues"" that had led to stock shortages at the start of the year, sales picked up, Mr Brick said.However, he added: ""This came to an abrupt end when High Street footfall dropped dramatically, impacted by the protracted and unplanned period of extremely hot weather and the widespread distraction of England's success in the World Cup.""Although all retailers were impacted in some way, Menswear was specifically impacted negatively by the combination and longevity of these two external factors.""The position was exacerbated by the distressed discounting of some competitors.""In the second quarter of the year, Moss Bros said customer footfall at its stores fell by 7% on average, with the worst affected outlets seeing a 14% drop.The retailer was pushed into a loss for the half-year after taking a £1.2m impairment charge for a ""small number of underperforming stores"", and a £800,000 hit from ""reorganisation and employee-related costs"".Moss Bros said it was still on track to deliver a full-year operating profit, excluding one-off items, but it would be ""materially lower than current market expectation of £2.3m.""The news sent shares in Moss Bros down by nearly 30% at one point, before they recovered to slightly to stand 13% lower.Moss Bros first opened in Covent Garden, London in 1851, and now has 130 stores."
business	Superdry in profit warning after heatwave hits sales	'Waning credibility'	"Superdry shares have fallen more than 20% after the retailer warned of a £10m hit to profits because the recent heatwave hurt sales of winter clothes.""Unseasonably hot weather conditions in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of the USA,"" were to blame, the company said.The problem has continued into October, with sales of jumpers and jackets particularly badly hit, Superdry said.The company also said it faced £8m in additional foreign exchange costs.""Superdry is a strong brand with significant growth opportunities... but we are not immune to the challenges presented by this extraordinary period of unseasonably hot weather,"" said chief executive Euan Sutherland.In August, the British Retail Consortium warned that if the warm weather continued into October it could cost non-food retailers more than £300m of autumn and winter sales.Superdry makes about 70-75% of profits in the second half of the year. The company is, however, five months into an 18-month plan to diversify its range to reduce reliance on winter sales.The group also pointed to the turbulent retail environment, noting ""well-publicised challenges"" faced by some of its trading partners.One of these partners is Zalando, a huge European online-only fashion retailer. Last month the company issued its second profit warning, blaming the ""long and hot summer"" for a fall in sales.Other suppliers to House of Fraser, such as Ted Baker and Mulberry, have already flagged the negative impact on profits which resulted from the administration.Retail analyst Nick Bubb said that, given some other retailers have warned about the warm autumn weather, the Superdry statement could have been expected. But he described the £8m hit due to exchange rate factors as ""mysterious"", and said details about future profit and sales guidance were sketchy.Despite the company saying Superdry had good growth prospects, Mr Bubb warned that ""management credibility is on the wane"".Superdry will issue its scheduled first-half results announcement on 8 November."
business	Uber aims for $90bn stock market debut	Disappointing	"Uber has revealed that it is seeking a valuation of $90bn (£70bn) in its much anticipated stock market flotation.The taxi-app firm has said that its shares will be priced at between $44 and $50 each, with the share issue set to raise about $10bn.As part of the offer it will sell $500m worth of shares to payment giant, PayPal.Uber warned earlier this month that it may never make a profit.The IPO price values the company below the $100bn some had expected it to aim for.As well as the original ""ride-hailing"" business, Uber is developing driverless cars, and has a food delivery business, Uber Eats.Alongside details of the Initial Public Offering (IPO), Uber also revealed its latest quarterly figures.These showed that its drivers made 1.5 billion passenger journeys during the first three months of 2019, but the company reported a net loss of about $1bn.Earlier this month, shares in rival US taxi-hailing giant Lyft started trading in New York. However, after a strong start, its share price sagged and is now 20% below the initial price paid by investors.Uber, which has been in business for 10 years, is selling 180 million shares in the offering, with a further 27 million sold by company insiders.The company will spend the next 10 days marketing itself to investors, to drum up interest and avoid following the disappointing path set by Lyft.As well as PayPal, Uber already has some high-profile stakeholders.These include Google parent, Alphabet, Japan's Softbank, and the Saudi Public Investment Fund.Uber's founder, controversial businessman Travis Kalanick, also has a significant stake.Uber's nearly four million drivers have been offered ""appreciation awards"" which can be taken in cash, or in the new shares.Investors will press the company on its best guesses for future profitability, the state of its relations with the cities in which it operates and its drivers, as well as its progress on developing driverless vehicles.Uber's drivers in seven US cities are planning protests to coincide with the expected start of share trading.They say they are paid below minimum wage levels required by some states and barely above national rates."
business	Goals Soccer Centres admits 'substantial' VAT error	Mike Ashley blow	"Five-a-side football firm Goals Soccer Centres has uncovered ""substantial"" VAT errors totalling £12m so far, but has warned the final cost is not yet known.It said the mistake went back ""several years"" and it needed more details to establish the full cost of the blunder.The new VAT accounting policies it will now need to adopt ""may have an impact on future profitability"", Goals warned.Shares have been suspended because the error could lead to ""a material change"" in its financial position, it said.The firm, which operates 50 outdoor football centres in the UK and California, says it plans to enter into discussions with HMRC immediately.""The value associated with these errors is still to be finalised but remains significant,"" it said.The group added it would make ""further announcements in due course as the results of the investigation become known"".The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who owns more than 18% of the firm.The revelation comes after Goals admitted earlier this month that it had discovered accounting errors. At the time, it said full-year results - originally due to come out on 12 March - would be ""materially below"" expectations and delayed their publication.However, on Wednesday it said trading since 8 March had been strong in both the UK and US.It has been a torrid year for Goals. In January, the East Kilbride-based firm warned on profits after it said that selling food and drink, and offering children's birthday parties, had increased costs as it had to hire more staff.In spite of this, it had still estimated profit for 2018 of between £4.3m to £4.5m, figures which are now in question."
business	Jaguar Land Rover posts £3.4bn loss as China demand slips		"Jaguar Land Rover booked a loss for the last three months of 2018 as sales collapsed in China.The company booked a £3.1bn reduction in the value of its plants and other investments leading to a £3.4bn quarterly loss, its biggest to date.Carmakers are being hit by stronger regulations and demand for cleaner models.Sales for the quarter were £6.2bn, down from £6.3bn a year earlier. It sold 144,602 vehicles, down from 154,447.Jaguar chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""Jaguar Land Rover reported strong third-quarter sales in the UK and North America, but our overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China.""Excluding the write-down, which affects its balance sheet but has no effect on cash, the company posted a loss of £273m.Much of the firm's model range is currently diesel-powered, while diesel sales in Europe have been falling.Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has embarked on a major restructuring programme to prepare for the future and boost profitability.It has already announced plans to cut thousands of jobs.It has now accepted that the value of its existing investments - such as factories, equipment and model designs - is substantially lower than previously thought, said BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett."
business	Facebook's UK tax bill jumps as profits rise	Expansion plans	"Facebook's UK tax bill has tripled to £15.8m - but the social media giant will see an immediate cut because of a tax credit.The final bill comes to £7.4m, since Facebook will see tax relief of £8.4m after awarding shares to employees.In 2016, Facebook's tax bill rose to £5.1m, following a major overhaul of the social media firm's tax structure.However, the company's profits only climbed by £4m year-on-year from £58.4m to £62.7m in 2017.The company's UK office provides marketing services and sales and engineering support to the company.Facebook's revenue rose by a third year-on-year to £1.2bn in 2017, because of increased revenues from inter-company and advertising reseller services in 2017.""We have changed the way we report tax so that revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is recorded in the UK and any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax,"" said Facebook's Northern Europe vice-president, Steve Hatch.In 2017, Facebook gave out 1.48 million restricted ordinary shares (RSU) to employees, a move that reduces its tax liability.This is one million fewer shares than it gave out in 2016.The publication of Facebook's 2017 tax accounts follows extensive criticism from policymakers and the media over the last 12 months of how much tax tech giants typically pay in Europe.Large technology companies have been condemned for moving sales through other countries and paying modest amounts of tax in the UK.Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond raised the prospect of introducing a new tax to address this concern.Meanwhile, online payments firm PayPal has announced that its UK subsidiary has agreed to pay an extra £3.1m in tax following a review by HMRC.The social networking giant said that it intended to expand its UK operations further in the future.In July, it signed a new facility lease in the UK.In 2017, Facebook employed 330 more people than the previous year - a 34% increase in headcount.Mr Hatch said that the UK was Facebook's largest engineering base outside the US.Facebook is doubling its office space in King's Cross, London, and will have capacity for more than 6,000 workstations by 2022, he added."
business	Apple falls below $1tn despite revenue and profit rise	'Weakness'	"Apple briefly lost its $1tn valuation on Thursday when its shares fell 7% in after-hours trading despite posting record results.The tech giant's strategy of charging more for its phones has paid off, with revenues jumping in the last three months despite relatively flat sales.Revenues rose 20% to $62.9bn year-on-year, and profits rose 31% to $14.1bn.But a warning of possible weaker sales in coming months sparked a share price slide after official trading ended.The sell-off accelerated after Apple said it would stop disclosing the number of units sold.Apple executives defended their decision, arguing that the figures are no longer good indicators of the firm's financial health.Analysts, however, warned that outsiders may view it as a move that masks less sunny performance.The total number of smartphones sold by all makers globally declined for the first time in 2017.But Apple's strategy of charging higher prices for its phones has helped it to shrug off flagging demand.The firm sold 46.9 million iPhones in the quarter to end-September, a modest rise on the 46.7 million sold for the same period last year.The California-based company is also making more money from ""services"" such as the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay. Services revenue hit a record $10bn in the quarter.For the firm's full 2018 financial year, profits increased 23% to $59.5bn, as revenue rose 16% to $265.5bn.""I can reassure that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have,"" Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri told financial analysts.""A unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past.""Despite the record figures, shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading, falling by 4% and then by more than 7%. They quickly started to rebound, lifting the firm's market value back above $1tn.The decline was blamed in part on a disappointing forecast for the important Christmas season.Apple said it expects sales of $89bn to $93bn for the quarter that ends 31 December, against Wall Street's $93bn forecast.It posted sales of $88.3bn in the quarter last year.Chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple is ""seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets"" such as Turkey, India, Brazil and Russia.He said some of that is due to currency fluctuation.Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said Apple also faces some supply uncertainty related to the roll-out of its latest products.The firm, which relies on China for manufacturing, is at risk as trade tensions between US and China rise, though its products have so far been spared from tariffs.Mr Cook said he remains optimistic that the two countries will resolve their issues.So far, Apple's business has not been affected he added, pointing to a 16% revenue rise in its Greater China region in the most recent quarter.Apple's App store has felt the impact of a ""moratorium"" on Chinese approvals for new games, but that is a domestic issue, he added."
business	Tesco shares hit by weaker than expected profits	Brexit plans	"Tesco shares have tumbled 8% after the company reported disappointing profits.While Tesco reported its 11th quarter in a row of rising sales, analysts were troubled by weak profit growth.During the first half of the year, pre-tax profits rose 2.2% to £564m.Across the group like-for-like sales, which remove the impact of new stores, rose 4.2% in the second quarter. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said this was the best sales growth in more than a decade.The firm had ""made a good start to the year"", Mr Lewis said, with profits mainly driven by growth in the UK and Ireland.But some analysts were more cautious.Bruno Monteyne, an analyst with investment bank Bernstein, said that Tesco has delivered strong sales growth in food in the UK and at Booker, but overall profits were ""soft"".Others had concerns over profit margins.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said analysts had been expecting profits margins to be about 4% by 2020, but the supermarket chain saw margins of closer to 3.5%.Neil Wilson of Markets.com said investors may have been expecting too much of Tesco.""This looks rather like expectations had maybe been set a little too high, rather than Tesco underperforming,"" he said.Last month Tesco unveiled a new discount chain called Jack's to take on discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.Mr Lewis said he was ""really very happy so far"" with the performance of the two new stores.""So far, so very very good,"" he said. ""The two stores are trading very well, consumer feedback is really very good.""Two more Jack's will launch on Thursday in Edge Hill and St Helens in Liverpool, he added.Sales at Booker, the food wholesaler that Tesco bought at the end of last year, jumped 15.1%.Mr Lewis said that retail market conditions were tough, and that the supermarket was making contingency plans for Brexit.""The biggest single challenge will be in a no-deal scenario, will be what happens with fresh food,"" he said.""It's all about product flow [over borders]. The possibility of stockpiling fresh food is very, very limited.""Mr Lewis said in the lead-up to Brexit Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up.He added that the retailer was looking at stockpiling grocery products, with contingency planning stepping up after Christmas if a deal is still not struck."
business	Barclays profits hit by £2bn of costs		"Litigation costs and settlements have made a big dent in Barclays' profits for the first half of the year.Pre-tax profits fell from £2.3bn to £1.6bn after the bank paid out about £2bn, including a £1.4bn settlement with the US Justice Department.But without the charges, pre-tax profits jumped by 20% to £3.7bn, with the UK arm seeing a 30% rise to £826m.Boss Jes Staley called the figures ""strong"", with the bank starting to show ""its true potential"".The charges that knocked the profits in the six months to 30 June also included a £400m provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance.Total revenue for the period was flat at £10.9bn.Shares closed 4.9% lower at 182.3p.Mr Staley, the bank's chief executive, noted in a statement that the charges came in the first three months of the year, and that the last quarter was the first ""for some time with no significant litigation or conduct charges, restructuring costs or other exceptional expenses which hit our profitability"".""In effect, then, it is the first clear sight of the statutory performance of the business which we have re-engineered over the past two and a half years - Barclays' transatlantic consumer and wholesale bank - and it is a positive sight.""Mr Staley added: ""This first-half performance shows a bank beginning to demonstrate its true potential and value.""The numbers we have posted strengthen our confidence that Barclays can deliver attractive and sustainable profits, and in our ability to return a greater proportion of those profits to shareholders over time.""Barclays' core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength and cushion against sudden shocks, rose to 13%, just above analysts' average forecast of 12.9%. In the first three months of 2018, the ratio was 12.7%.Analyst Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The clouds are beginning to clear at Barclays as it ushers in a new era as a more effective and streamlined global bank... Light at the end of the tunnel seems to be getting brighter.""But he added: ""Less positively, there a few areas of concern which will need to be addressed. Operating expenses in the UK arm increased, coupled with a decline in income, the cost/income ratio is still higher than some of its peers (although improving) and currency headwinds have hampered performance.""The Barclays share price, which jumped about 1% at the start of trading, began drifting back soon afterwards.The profit figures come as Barclays pushes back against calls to prune its investment bank from activist investor Edward Bramson.New York-based Mr Bramson, who disclosed a surprise 5% stake in Barclays in February, has argued that the bank should pare parts of the investment bank that do not directly serve corporate clients.""We are in conversations with Bramson, I have met him, and we look forward to meeting him post these results,"" Mr Staley said. ""But he has not outlined what his strategy is to us."""
business	GE chief executive departs amid profit warning	Power problems	"General Electric has ousted its chief executive, installing new leadership for the second time in two years as it struggles to return to growth.Larry Culp, a GE board member who ran US manufacturer Danaher for more than a decade, is to replace GE veteran John Flannery, effective immediately.Shares surged almost 10% on the news, although the firm also warned it would fall short of its profit forecasts.Mr Flannery had been in the role for less than two years.He took over from veteran chief executive Jeff Immelt, who had led the US industrial giant since 2001.Last year, Mr Flannery announced a turnaround plan aimed at simplifying the business model of the conglomerate, which had grown to encompass everything from light bulbs to loans.Since then, GE has announced the sale of several divisions, including its rail and health technology units.However, the disposals have failed to rebuild investor confidence and shares have almost halved in the past 12 months.In June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average cut the company from its 30-company stock index - a move that reflected its shrinking position in the US economy.Mr Culp, 55, who will be chairman as well as chief executive, said GE ""remains a fundamentally strong company with great businesses and tremendous talent"".It remains committed to its spin-off strategy, he added. That will leave it focused on areas such as jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.""We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE. I am excited to get to work,"" Mr Culp said.GE has been dogged by problems at its power division, which makes machinery for power plants and has struggled amid tepid demand.On Monday, the firm said it expected to write down $23bn in impairment charges on its power division.The company has also appointed former American Airlines chief executive Thomas Horton as lead director on its board."
business	Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler to cut 10,000 jobs worldwide	Electric cars	"Daimler, the German carmaker that owns Mercedes-Benz, has said it will shed at least 10,000 jobs worldwide as it seeks to fund the switch to electric cars.Daimler personnel chief Wilfried Porth told journalists the number of jobs lost would be ""in the five figures"".The move comes days after rival Audi said it would cut 9,500 of its 61,000 jobs in Germany for similar reasons.Daimler said the car industry was going through ""the biggest transformation in its history"".""The development towards CO2-neutral mobility requires large investments, which is why Daimler announced in the middle of November that it would launch a programme to increase competitiveness, innovation and investment strength,"" the firm said.""Part of this programme is to reduce staff costs by around €1.4bn by the end of 2022 and, among other things, to reduce the number of management positions worldwide by 10%.""Daimler, which has a global workforce of nearly 300,000 and factories in 17 countries, said it would reduce costs and employment ""in a socially responsible manner"", including the use of ""natural fluctuation"".""In addition, the possibilities for part-time retirement will be expanded and a severance programme will be offered in Germany in order to reduce jobs in the administration,"" it added.Daimler said its plans had been agreed with the firm's works council, which includes union representation.German carmakers have been slow to adapt to new technological trends, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.At the same time, they have been suffering falling demand in China, while the trade war between Washington and Bejing has also dented growth."
business	Viagogo buys rival ticketing website StubHub in $4bn deal	'Wider choice'	"Secondary ticketing firm Viagogo has announced a $4bn (£3.1bn) deal to buy its rival StubHub, in a move it said would create more choice for customers.Viagogo is buying its rival from eBay, which bought StubHub in 2007 for $310m.It means Viagogo's boss Eric Baker will be reunited with StubHub, which he co-founded but left before the eBay sale.The deal comes after the UK's competition authority suspended legal action against Viagogo after it made changes to the way it operates.In September, Viagogo amended the way it presents information to customers which the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said meant the website was now ""worlds apart"" from the one that prompted the legal action.The CMA had asked operators such as Viagogo to improve the information they provided about tickets, such as the risk a buyer would be turned away at the door, which ticket they were getting, and the availability and popularity of tickets.In May 2018, the then Digital Minister Margot James told the BBC that if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"".Mr Baker, who is co-founder and chief executive of Viagogo, said that it had ""long been my wish to unite the two companies"".""I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared futures.""Buyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers. Bringing these two companies together creates a win-win for fans - more choice and better pricing.""StubHub has a bigger presence in the US than Viagogo, which is better known in the UK and other parts of the world.They are ""pretty perfect complementary businesses,"" Cris Miller, Viagogo's managing director, told the BBC.He acknowledged the controversies surrounding Viagogo - which two years ago did not turn up to a hearing with MPs - and did not rule out StubHub becoming the preferred brand.""The reality is we don't know quite yet,"" Mr Miller said.""We, at Viagogo, have made a considerable amount of changes to the website, have addressed a considerable amount of the concerns that regulators have seen over the world... so it remains to be seen. Certainly we have a lot to learn from them [StubHub].""The takeover is subject to regulatory approval. Mr Miller said he expected that ""steps would be required for us to adhere to"" and added that Viagogo would work with regulators to ensure the deal was approved.He said the deal was good for ticket buyers as sellers had to compete on price on the website.""The sellers are required to compete with each other, so the more sellers that are on the platform the more ticket inventory that is up there.

It comes after the company faced pressure from activist investors - Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value - to sell off parts of its operations, including StubHub.Scott Schenkel, interim chief executive at eBay, said the deal was a ""great outcome and maximises long-term value for eBay shareholders""."
business	Work romance: 'I was sacked for falling in love'	'Hammer dropped'Human passionsAmorous advances	"Australian businessman Gary Lyon still thinks it was ""bizarre"" that he lost his senior management job for dating a junior colleague.But it all turned out for the best in the end - he has been married to Tamra for 12 years and they have an 11-year-old daughter, Charlotte.Now Mr Lyon and his wife have their own company in Brisbane and he says he would be perfectly happy if two of his employees fell in love.""It wouldn't bother me in the slightest,"" he says, ""as long as it didn't affect their work.""Mr Lyon contacted the BBC after reading that McDonald's had fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he had a relationship with an employee.The US fast food giant said the relationship was consensual, but Mr Easterbrook had ""violated company policy"" and shown ""poor judgement"".The issue has shed light on the difficulties that staff can face if they find romance at work, especially if one is more senior than the other.In Mr Lyon's case, he was an operations manager at a firm making doors and windows. He met the future Mrs Lyon when she joined his team as a project co-ordinator. After three or four months, they got together at an office function.""I always liked her and she made it known that she liked me as well,"" he said. ""It went from there.""At the time, he was 41 and she was 14 years younger. They initially kept the relationship secret, but eventually made it known that they were an item.""You don't believe it's an issue for other people, but it transpires that it is, and you don't see why, because it doesn't impact your work,"" he says.""You spend a lot of time with people at work, so you get to know them quite well.""After the couple had been seeing each other for about three months, he was called in and, as he puts it: ""Then the hammer dropped.""He lost his job, but she kept hers. ""She was pretty upset, but there's not much you can do. You've just got to keep going.""Mr Lyon says there was no clear workplace code in place about dating colleagues. He describes the decision as ""very arbitrary"" and says it represents ""a very archaic view of the world"".""Should managers be banned from dating subordinates? Not if it is consensual,"" he says.""You can't choose where you find love, so why penalise both parties by firing one of them?""According to various studies, between a quarter and a third of all long-term relationships start at work.But of course, not all liaisons between co-workers are long-term. Some are flings, affairs, one-night stands - whatever you want to call them.And a number of high-profile cases serve as a reminder of just how tricky life can get when human passions collide with corporate culture:At the same time, the sexual harassment allegations against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein have made HR departments wary of any sexual activity between staff, especially in the US.However, Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says only a minority of employers have specific stand-alone policies on relationships at work.""Most employers tend to take a different approach,"" he says. ""They will have policies on dignity and respect at work and preventing bullying and sexual harassment, setting out clear policies for dealing with complaints about inappropriate behaviour.""Mr Willmott points out that under the Human Rights Act in the UK, employees have a right to privacy and a family life, so firms need to strike a balance.""If you have a very prescriptive approach, it can suggest that you don't trust your employees to act as adults in the workplace,"" he says.Of course, there is the potential for conflicts of interest if staff are not careful.""If one of the parties in the relationship is responsible for the other's appraisals, pay reviews, promotion opportunities and even work allocation, then there is danger of favouritism and from team members, perceived bias,"" says Rebecca Thornley-Gibson, partner at City of London law firm DMH Stallard.""There may also be issues where the more junior employee feels as though they cannot say no to amorous advances, and this creates a real risk of later sexual harassment claims against the manager and employer.""Stopping relationships is not likely to be practical for employers, she says, but having policies to minimise any fallout from the relationship should be considered.""This will involve having in place and communicating workplace policies on conduct at work, equality and diversity policies with a clear zero-tolerance towards sexual harassment, and also requiring employees to declare relationships that are likely to result in a potential conflict."""
business	Top fund manager forced to resign after BBC investigation	Leaked documentsConflict of interest'Complied with duties'Controversial energy deal	"One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (£229bn; €265bn) of investors' money at Capital Group.BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.Panorama Can You Trust the Billion Pound Investors? is broadcast on Monday at 20.30"
business	Mike Ashley sacks House of Fraser management team	'Heavy handed'Missing luxuryAnalysis:	"Mike Ashley's firm has sacked the senior management at House of Fraser just weeks after it bought the chain.In a one-sentence statement, Sports Direct said it had ""dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser"".Those departing the chain will include chief executive Alex Williamson. It is not clear who will replace the management team at House of Fraser.Sports Direct paid £90m for House of Fraser's 58 UK stores in August.Richard Lim of Retail Economics, a consultancy, said the new owner had taken ""drastic action following a series of woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and an outdated perception of the UK market"".He added: ""The retailer operates in the part of the industry under the most significant amount of pressure and the race is on to rapidly restructure the business to ensure the takeover is a success.""Richard Hyman, independent retail analyst, agreed the previous management team had been weak, but said this way of bringing in new leadership was unnecessarily abrupt: ""He was always likely to want his own people in there. One might have thought he'd do it in a low key way, avoiding making waves and disruption.""But he is always unconventional and thus seems like an over-dramatic, heavy handed and unnecessarily negative way of doing it.""One would have thought a few of them would be worth keeping in order to maintain continuity at least.""On Monday, flooring and furniture specialist ScS, which operates concessions in 27 House of Fraser stores, said the problems at the department store chain meant trading at those concessions remained ""challenging"".""We are currently in discussions with the new owners with a view to agreeing a mutually beneficial arrangement, which will allow us to continue trading in a profitable manner in as many of the current concessions as possible,"" ScS added.Mr Ashley has vowed to turn the department store chain into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and to keep most of its stores open.""We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands,"" he told the Sun in August.Since buying House of Fraser, Mr Ashley has been negotiating with the chain's landlords to try to cut rents.Emma Simpson, business correspondentIt's not that surprising the top brass at House of Fraser are being shown the door. The chairman, Frank Slevin, has already left - a key executive who had no retail experience. The chief executive, Alex Williamson, who was appointed little over a year ago, also lacked a background in retail having previously run the Goodwood estate in Sussex.The chain's chief financial officer also had no retail background to speak of either. House of Fraser's problems go back many years. But many observers believe these top executives simply didn't have the necessary expertise to turn around such a big and complex chain.It's not clear from the brief statement how many of the management team Mr Ashley has dismissed. The big question is who is going to run the business from now on, with the crucial Christmas trading period getting underway? Reviving the fortunes of House of Fraser will take great skill as well as investment.Last month, he said that 15 sites previously earmarked for closure would stay open. However, Mr Ashley blamed ""greedy landlords"" for the closure of stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon.Sports Direct was forced to rule out making a takeover bid for Debenhams after Simon Bentley, an outgoing director of Sports Direct, said the board had discussed combining the two department store chains.Mr Ashley's firm owns a 29.7% stake in Debenhams.Mr Bentley later said he had ""made no mention of any merger""."
business	Northern rail could be nationalised		"The government is considering whether the management of the North of England's largest rail commuter service should be taken into public hands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Northern's poor performance, with trains regularly arriving late or not at all, ""cannot continue"".Mr Shapps said he had issued a ""request for proposals"" from the firm and the Operator of Last Resort (OLR).This could lead to services being brought into direct government control.Giving evidence to the Commons' Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""As a fellow long-suffering commuter, I entirely believe we cannot carry on just thinking it is OK for trains not to arrive, or Sunday services not to be in place. That has to change.""The Department for Transport confirmed it was developing contingency plans for the replacement of the current franchise ""with either a new short-term management contract with Northern or the Operator of Last Resort (OLR)"".""In the context of significant challenges facing the operator, such as delays to infrastructure upgrades and historic underinvestment in the northern rail network, issuing a request for proposal enables the department to examine whether the contract is properly aligned with current operating challenges in the North,"" it said.""It also allows us to determine whether the franchise owner or an OLR would be best placed to tackle these issues and deliver for passengers.""David Brown, managing director at Northern, said the firm had faced several challenges in the past couple of years, outside the direct control of Northern.The most significant of these is the continuing late delivery of major infrastructure upgrades, including the North West electrification, which is more than two years late.Mr Brown added: ""Arriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North's railways and improving customers' experience. We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation.""This is another black mark for Britain's rail system.A second franchise, potentially brought under government control is not what Conservative ministers wanted.Labour will press its argument that the system is so broken that the same should happen to all train companies.But Northern (a large commuter network) is a much more complex franchise than the East Coast Mainline (intercity services) which the government took control of last year and rebranded LNER.For that reason the government is probably keen to stop short of the ""full public control"" option and take-on a more supervisory role, with Arriva (Northern's parent company) still in charge of the day-to-day.But several leading politicians argue Northern has failed and therefore should be removed wholesale from managing the franchise.Northern argues the system is at fault because delayed infrastructure upgrades (managed by publicly-owned Network Rail) have not allowed it to run the services passengers demand.There is no silver bullet to fixing the railways but the government-commissioned rail review will, in a matter of weeks, attempt to come up with answers.Northern, which is one of the biggest franchises in the country, has been in trouble for years. Industry sources have confirmed to the BBC that the train company, which is owned by Arriva, has been losing money for some time.Passenger numbers on Northern dropped after the botched introduction of new timetables in the summer of last year.Mr Shapps said: ""If you are northern, and you are a Northern passenger, you're as frustrated as I was in 2018. With Northern it has failed to recover.""On Friday, Transport for the North said it believed the franchise should be taken into public hands, via what is known as an Operator of Last Resort (OLR). The OLR is, on behalf of the government, currently in charge of London North East Railway, the East Coast Mainline intercity franchise.However, the OLR is not the only option for the government.It could also opt for what is known as a ""management contract"", which would mean that Arriva would still operate rail services, but the Department for Transport would adopt a much more hands-on role for the operation of the franchise.The OLR has been monitoring Northern for some time and any change to the operation of the franchise would take months to implement.A review of the railways in the UK is already under way. The Williams Review, led by former British Airways boss Keith Williams, is due to publish its findings in coming weeks. It is expected that the rail franchise system will be completely overhauled, a point mentioned in the Queen's Speech earlier this week."

However, it produced just 2,270 in the last week of April.Investors are also concerned about the rate at which it is spending cash. In the three months to the end of March its cash balances fell by $700m to $2.7bn.Mr Musk had signalled he was going to restructure the business at the start of May, adding that the number of ""third-party contracting companies that we're using has really gotten out of control"".Several senior staff have subsequently stepped back from or quit the company.On Friday, Tesla said that Doug Field, senior vice president of engineering, had taken a leave of absence to spend more time with his family.It said Mr Field, who had been in charge of production until earlier this year, ""had not left the firm"" but gave no indication of when he would return.In addition Matthew Schwall, the company's main technical contact with safety regulators, left to join rival Waymo earlier this month.In his email on Monday, Mr Musk said Tesla would recruiting for key positions ""to support the Model 3 production ramp and future product development""."
business	Spying scandal forces out Credit Suisse executive	Property row'Severe reputational damage'	"Credit Suisse's chief operating officer has resigned after a probe found he arranged the surveillance of an executive who left to join rival UBS.Private detectives were hired to track the Swiss bank's former head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan in September, in a scandal that has rocked the normally staid world of Swiss banking.Mr Khan left the bank in July.There was no indication chief executive Tidjane Thiam, who had fallen out with Mr Khan, knew about the surveillance.Credit Suisse said the investigation found that it was chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée alone who had decided to initiate the observation of Mr Khan.Mr Khan had initially been praised and promoted by Mr Thiam.But there were reports that a personal animosity had developed, which intensified after Mr Khan bought and spent two years redeveloping a property near Lake Zurich which neighboured a property belonging to his boss.Media reports suggest there was an altercation in January between Mr Khan and Mr Thiam's girlfriend at a cocktail party held by the chief executive at his home, over trees planted on Mr Thiam's property.Shortly after that Mr Khan announced his departure from Credit Suisse.The scandal surfaced in September when it transpired that the bank had hired corporate intelligence firm Investigo to track Mr Khan, due to fears he might poach clients when he started work at UBS this week.Mr Khan, after noticing he was being tailed, confronted the person observing him. His version of the altercation that ensued differs markedly from the report from Investigo and the incident is under criminal investigation.Questions were raised over who within Credit Suisse instigated the operation to have Mr Khan followed, and who was aware of it.As a result Credit Suisse hired law firm Homburger to examine the chain of responsibility and whether Mr Khan had violated the terms of his contract.The personal relationship between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan was not part of the investigation, Credit Suisse said.""The Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to September 18, 2019, after the observation had been aborted,"" the bank said.Credit Suisse said that the decision to observe Mr Khan was ""wrong and disproportionate and has resulted in severe reputational damage to the bank"".The Homburger report said neither its own investigations nor those of intelligence firm Investigo found evidence that Mr Khan had attempted to poach employees or customers away from Credit Suisse."

business	Korean Air 'nut rage' heiress makes management comeback	Power abuse	The former Korean Air executive who was sacked and jailed for a 'nut rage' tantrum on board a plane has made a corporate comeback.Heather Cho, heiress to the South Korean conglomerate which owns the airline, has returned to work for another of its businesses.Ms Cho will take control of four hotels operated by the KAL Hotel Network.She hit the headlines in 2014, after forcing the plane to return to its gate during a row over how nuts were served.Ms Cho was fired and later charged after the incident on the runway of New York's JFK Airport.It emerged she had demanded a junior crew member be removed from the flight after they offered Ms Cho macadamia nuts in a bag, instead of presenting them on a plate.Ms Cho, 44, is the heiress of the Hanjin Group - one of South Korea's massive family-run business empires.At the time of the incident she was executive vice-president of Korean Air, and became another symbol of the excess and entitled culture in the country's so-called chaebols.Ms Cho was convicted of violating aviation safety, coercion and abuse of power in 2015.But after serving less than half of her year-long jail term, she was later cleared of violating the aviation security law and her sentence was suspended on appeal.You might also like:The court maintained the minor convictions, including interfering with business practices, but reduced her penalty to 10 months in prison, suspended for two years.The Supreme Court upheld that ruling last December.The flight attendant she scolded, Park Chang-jin, has reportedly launched legal action against Korean Air, claiming he was demoted and has faced discrimination in the company since the incident.
business	TSB lacked common sense before IT meltdown, says report	'A complete demolition of trust'	"The board of TSB has been accused of a lack of ""common sense"" in the run-up to IT failures that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to bank online, some for several weeks, in April 2018.An independent report into the incident by law firm Slaughter and May blamed both TSB and IT provider Sabis.Customers were moved on to a new system, but the report said it had not been tested properly before going live.It found that the tests only took place offline and not in a live environment.It said that TSB accepted that had tests been run across both systems, it might have been able to identify the issues which affected customers before they happened.""We have concluded that the new platform was not ready to support TSB's full customer base and Sabis was not ready to operate the new platform,"" the report said.""While the TSB board asked a number of pertinent questions... there were certain additional common sense challenges that the TSB board did not put to the executive.""These included why it was reasonable to expect that TSB would be 'migration ready' only four months later than originally planned, when certain workstreams were as much as seven months behind schedule.""The report also said that there were more than 2,000 defects relating to testing at the time the system went live, but the board were only told about 800.Other failings by TSB that it identified included setting ""unnecessary"" time constraints, which did not understand the complexity of the project, and being dishonest about the reasons for delays.TSB is part of the Spanish banking group Sabadell and its in-house IT provider Sabis built the system.The IT failure has cost TSB a total of £330m for customer compensation, fraud losses and other expenses.The IT fiasco at TSB left many thousands of customers in difficulty, calls were unanswered for 90 minutes and fraud attacks were 70 times higher than usual levels at their peak, the report reveals.Among those affected was photographer Paul Clarke, who could not use his accounts and was defrauded in the confusion. He says he left the bank as soon as was reasonably possible.""After the fraud, there was a complete demolition of trust,"" he says. ""I was left for two weeks without being able to function financially.""He was annoyed about the fraud, although the money was later refunded, but more so about the response from TSB to the situation.He described the failures of the IT switchover as ""basic stuff"".The timing of the IT mess could not have been worse for Sally and Chris Jones - TSB mortgage holders - whose house move turned into 24 hours of chaos.""It was terrible timing for us, that they were not ready [with the IT switchover],"" says Mrs Jones.Problems at TSB meant funds were not released so they were stuck in limbo, waiting outside their new home in a removals van, facing the prospect of staying overnight in a hotel.""It was all very chaotic,"" she says.Eventually they got inside, but there were still problems with completing the purchase and early in the mortgage term. They were compensated and have not had problems since, so have remained as customers.TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings said: ""Slaughter and May's report sets out a number of findings on aspects of the planning and preparation for migration which they believe could have been done differently.""In light of the disruption customers experienced, TSB has made important changes to enable the bank to rebuild - including to leadership and management structures, as well as the decision to take direct control of its IT operations.""Importantly, TSB has long since compensated every eligible customer who was impacted by the disruption.""TSB's former chief executive Paul Pester, who quit his job a few months after the incident, said: ""If these findings are right, Sabis rolled the dice by running tests on only one of TSB's two new data centres and this decision was kept from me and the rest of the TSB board.""The report explains that this made it impossible for the TSB board to anticipate the serious problems experienced by many customers who could not access their accounts.""Obviously, if we had been aware of Sabis's shortcuts in the testing programme, the TSB board and I would never have pressed ahead with switching to the new system at that time.""The Slaughter and May report was commissioned by TSB. Another joint report by two regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, will be published at a later date. Those regulators have the power to fine and reprimand businesses and individuals."
business	The shareholders fighting to make oil firms greener	Global Trade'Costs rising'	"It is not every day that a surfer and environmental campaigner addresses the annual general meeting of one of the world's biggest oil companies.But that is what happened earlier this year, when Australian Heath Joske spoke to shareholders of the Norwegian firm Equinor at its AGM in the city of Stavanger.He implored them to back a resolution, brought by a small group of investors, to stop Equinor's plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight - a stretch of coastline in South Australia said to be one of the most unspoiled marine environments in the world.Oil-and-gas extraction posed huge risks to local wildlife and the climate, says Mr Joske, who lives in the region.""We see your plans to drill in the Bight as a direct threat to our culture and identity,"" he told the meeting.It is just the latest example of how so-called shareholder activism is being used to try to pressure big energy firms to adopt greener policies.Mr Joske was speaking on behalf of an alliance of environmental groups - led by Greenpeace Norway and the World Wildlife Fund - that had purchased enough shares in Equinor to be able to bring their resolution to the AGM.The motion called on the company to stop oil-and-gas exploration and production in ""frontier"" and ""pristine"" environments that would include the Bight.While it did not secure enough shareholder votes to pass, it did generate publicity for the campaign, which aims to convince Australia's regulator to reject Equinor's proposals when it announces its decision later in November.""Shareholder activism, and the dialogue that it produces between shareholders and a company's board, is a critical element of good corporate governance,"" says Brynn O'Brien, the head of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR).The ACCR backed the Equinor motion in May, and has filed others like it against firms such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.Ms O'Brien adds: ""Even though resolutions that are not supported by boards rarely pass, they quite often produce change in terms of company commitments to increased action to reduce emissions.""They can also convince firms to stop lobbying that is ""inconsistent"" with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change globally.One of the most successful activist groups has been Climate Action 100+, a global network of institutional investors that targets the world's 100 largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters.Its 370 members, which have $35tn (£27tn) of assets under management, include well-known names such as Aberdeen Standard, the Church of England Pensions Board and HSBC Global Asset Management.In March, the group, working with others, forced the oil giant Shell to make a legally binding commitment to use a broader definition of greenhouse gas emissions in its carbon-reduction targets.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Commenting on the resolution at the time, Shell said it acknowledged and agreed with the ""importance attached by its investors to the issue of climate change"". It also said the company's future success was ""contingent on its ability to effectively navigate the risks and the opportunities presented by climate change"".In another example, at BP's AGM in Aberdeen in May, Climate 100+ secured overwhelming approval for a motion that called on the oil giant to document its efforts to meet Paris Agreement goals in quarterly reports.As shareholder resolutions are almost always non-binding, BP could have chosen to ignore it. But the oil firm had held discussions with Climate 100+ before its AGM and agreed to support the proposal.""Climate 100+ have been really interesting to watch because they employ an engagement-first model as opposed to a shareholder proposal-first model,"" says Courteney Keatinge, head of environment at shareholder advisory Glass Lewis.""It has worked with the targeted companies, trying to understand their positions and priorities, prior to submitting a shareholder proposal, which is often seen as a more combative move by companies.""Despite such successes, major greenhouse gas emitters continue to extract and burn fossil fuels, and Ms Keatinge suggests there is only so much shareholder activists can do.""Without strong regulatory pressure and market incentive, companies are going to continue to take oil and coal out of the ground at their discretion.""There's a market for energy and if those needs are not being met, companies are going to find a way to meet them.""Despite pressure from shareholders and campaigners, Equinor still hopes to start drilling in the Bight. It argues it has a safe drilling record and that the project would benefit both its shareholders and the people of South Australia.""Production from existing oil and gas fields is declining, and there is a need for new supply to meet the future demand for energy,"" says spokesman Erik Haaland.""Even in recognised scenarios for the future that are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, there is considerable need for oil and gas over the next decades.""However, Ms O'Brien believes that the company could end up facing legal action if its plans for the Bight go ahead. That's because new drilling projects are highly expensive, while the oil market has been volatile recently.""The break-even point - how much a barrel of oil would have to be worth to justify the capital expenditure on the infrastructure that goes along with a frontier drilling operation - is rapidly rising,"" she says.""If shareholders - including the Norwegian people [Equinor is 67% state-owned] private investors and other states - lose money, they may be able to sue for losses if these decisions are found in the circumstances to have been unreasonable.""Australia's National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority will announce its decision on Equinor's plans for the Bight on 14 November. It has rejected a similar application from BP in the past.From his home in South Australia, Mr Joske tells the BBC that if drilling goes ahead then community opposition will intensify.He also believes that the shareholder resolutions brought at Equinor's May AGM were worthwhile, even though the firm has not changed course.""Nothing's changed here. We're just waiting on the decision right now and if they tick it off things will escalate, opposition-wise, for sure."""
business	Elliott Management: The hedge fund not afraid of a fight	Family firm to hedge fund giantVaried strategies	"Amid a spate of high-profile fights in the business world, one New York hedge fund has thrown a lot of punches.Elliott Management, which oversees more than $31bn (£22bn) worth of assets, has earned a reputation over 40 years as a no-holds-barred activist investor, with an unusually large appetite for public face-offs.The firm famously pursued Argentine debt for more than a decade, seizing one of the country's naval ships while it was docked in Ghana and prompting the country to default.It has taken on some of the world's biggest companies.In the UK, it intervened in coach operator National Express and fought supermarket Tesco for damages stemming from a 2014 accounting scandal.Elliott pushed Australian mining giant BHP Billiton to reorganise and last year, BHP agreed to sell its US shale business, one of Elliott's recommendations.It has also pressured South Korea giant Samsung to restructure.Meanwhile, AkzoNobel successfully fended off a takeover and reached a truce with Elliott, committing to improvements that included the sale of its chemicals business.Now it has struck again, this time buying a 6% stake in Whitbread. Reports say Elliott wants Whitbread to split its coffee chain from its hotel business.""They're renowned for being very involved and active,"" says Josh Black, editor-in-chief of Activist Insight, which tracks shareholder activism. ""Just by virtue of their size… they're able to cope with more public situations at any one time.""Founded in 1977 by Paul Singer, Elliott launched with $1.3m.Singer, a New Jersey native who trained at Harvard Law School, described it at the time as a ""tiny, little friends-and-family"" firm.Assets under management have risen sharply since, to about $19bn in 2012 and $31bn today. Its investor include very wealthy private individuals, sovereign wealth funds, foundations and pension funds.The hedge fund, which has had a base in London since 1994 as Elliott Advisors, has said it's only lost money twice - in 1998 and 2008.The firm's success has vaulted Singer into the ranks of the mega rich, with a net worth that Forbes estimates at $2.7bn. The 72-year-old Wall Street titan has also reportedly jammed with rocker Meat Loaf.A supporter of gay rights and Jewish charities, Singer has also attracted attention for his politics.He's put millions into Republican causes, backing the failed presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio and Rudy Giuliani.Last year, he said Donald Trump's anti-trade policies would lead to a global depression, but he opposed new financial rules introduced under former President Barack Obama and is likely to support some of the changes contemplated by the new regime.His firm's investment strategies range widely, from buying distressed debt, to intervening during mergers. It often targets companies where it believes the stock is undervalued, pushing for leadership changes, spin-offs, or share buybacks, which boost share values for existing stockholders.Critics compare the firm to a vulture capitalist, with a focus on short-term wins in its own interest. In 2014, French regulators fined Elliott for insider trading.Politicians worried about jobs in their districts are among those pushing back on some of the firm's recent efforts.Singer has rejected those characterisations.""I believe in a balance of power,"" he said at a conference in 2016. ""There's a whole industry of people to protect corporations, an industry devoted to saying that long-termism is a valuable, moral thing and short-termism is bad.""There are activist strategies that are destructive and harmful... but we think the things that we have done have added to stakeholder value.""Elliott itself has made demands on dozens of companies in recent years, turning its attention beyond the technology firms that were once its primary focus. The firm has also branched out its partnerships, working with a private equity firm in at least one instance and taking a large stake in Bentham Ventures, a firm focused on shareholder lawsuits.""That's all quite new,"" Black says."
business	Cuadrilla says it hopes to overturn fracking suspension	Why frack?	"Energy company Cuadrilla has said it hopes to ""address concerns"" about fracking so that a moratorium announced by the government can be overturned.At the weekend, ministers called a halt to the practice following research from the Oil and Gas Authority.It raised concerns about the ability to predict fracking-linked earthquakes.But Cuadrilla, which was forced to suspend work at its Preston New Road site after a series of tremors, said it would continue to give regulators data.It said it hoped ""to address concerns so that the moratorium can be lifted"" and that the Bowland gas resource - which stretches across northern England - could be ""further appraised and developed"".On Monday, Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom confirmed the ""effective moratorium"" in a written statement to the House of Commons.She said it would be ""maintained until compelling new evidence is provided which addresses the concerns around the prediction and management of induced seismicity"".However, the government is under pressure to make the ban permanent, amid concerns ministers - who have previously been supportive of fracking - are using it as an election ploy.Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it.Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland resource across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand.Others, however, have questioned these findings.Previously the government said shale development would provide opportunities for jobs and investment, and could play a ""key role"" in maintaining energy security.But the industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups, at a time when there is growing concern about the role of fossil fuels in climate change.It is not impossible, however, that the current moratorium could be lifted.Fracking previously faced a moratorium during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government that was overturned after just one year."
business	UK tobacco giant BAT to cut 2,300 jobs	Vaping concerns	"British American Tobacco has announced plans to cut 2,300 jobs as it shifts away from traditional cigarettes.BAT said it was creating a ""more efficient, agile and focused"" company as it focused on e-cigarettes and other new categories of product.The firm said management layers would be reduced and simplified under a plan to be substantially completed by January next year.A BAT spokesperson declined to give any details of where the jobs would go.The company has its headquarters in London and has 55,000 employees worldwide, with 55 factories in 48 countries.BAT shares were up 2.5% in Thursday morning trading in London.""With the focus on simplification and removal of management layers, it is expected that over 20% of the senior roles in the organisation will be affected,"" it said.New chief executive Jack Bowles, who has been in the role for five months, said he wanted to ""ensure a future fit culture"".""My goal is to oversee a step change in 'new category' growth and significantly simplify our current ways of working and business processes, whilst delivering long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. This is a vital first move to help achieve these goals,"" he added.Among its new category products is the Vype e-cigarette, which it launched in 2013.BAT's emphasis on ""new categories"" comes amid signs that US regulators are preparing to take a tougher stance on e-cigarettes.On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that his administration would ban flavoured e-cigarettes after a spate of vaping-related deaths.US Health Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would finalise a plan to take all non-tobacco flavours off the market.Earlier this week, US First Lady Melania Trump tweeted that she was ""deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children"".""The regulatory pressure on the tobacco industry just dialled up a notch,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.He said tobacco firms had turned their attention to e-cigarettes because of falling numbers of smokers and stricter rules in developing countries.""What's being announced across the Atlantic could see those plans go up in smoke, particularly given the size of that market. After all, it's not just the young who opt for flavoured vaping products,"" he added.""Today's announcement represents a bold first step for new chief executive Jack Bowles, but he must hope the crackdown on vaping doesn't see his growth ambitions run out of puff."""
business	Dragons' Den success story firm risks collapse	'Will not respond to questions'	"A firm founded by the youngest entrepreneur to secure investment on the BBC's Dragons' Den is on the brink of insolvency, the BBC has learnt.Gripit Fixings makes a product designed to fix heavy items to plasterboard. Its inventor, Jordan Daykin, was just 18 when he appeared on the programme.However, Mr Daykin left the company this summer and an insolvency practitioner has now been called in.The firm's board told investors it was in ""a precarious position"".Angry shareholders, who stand to lose their entire investment, have been reacting on a forum on the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube, which Gripit has used in the past to raise money.Some complained they had been misled about the company's strengths, others that Mr Daykin, who is now 24, had ignored requests for information.One said: ""The company is on its knees and Jordan has left it without any cares. I asked him a polite question on LinkedIn about it this afternoon and he very swiftly blocked me and removed my comment.""The news first emerged in an update to shareholders from the board and management team, seen by the BBC, which was sent out last week.It came after Gripit tried and failed to raise £1m in new capital by issuing new shares to existing investors.Gripit said the funding round had been under-subscribed and was therefore being cancelled.Mr Daykin patented his product in 2012. He came to prominence when he appeared on Dragons' Den in 2014 and successfully secured an £80,000 investment for 25% of his company from one of the show's stars, entrepreneur Deborah Meaden.By 2016, Gripit Fixings were stocked in more than 3,000 UK outlets and exported to 32 countries.Gripit is still listed as an investment on Ms Meaden's website, where she describes Mr Daykin as someone who ""knows his product and its market inside out"".Ms Meaden confirmed to the BBC that she was still an investor in the company.She added: ""I am pleased that the board and management team have taken quick and responsible action to address the challenges facing the company.""I will support them in whatever practical way I can as they work towards achieving the best possible outcome for all stakeholders.""Mr Daykin, who left the business four months ago, said it was ""upsetting"" to find the company in such a precarious position.He added: ""Despite the mischaracterisation, during my time as CEO I always took pride in my communications with all investors. Since stepping back, all investor communications have been handled internally.""In January, the company was valued at £22.5m and had raised some £4m from investors. However, at the time of its last fundraising round in September, it was valued at just £6m.Now its investors face the prospect of losing all their money.""Without a substantial cash injection, the company is not able to continue to trade into the future or deliver on its growth plans,"" said the update from Gripit.""To this end, the board have secured the advice of an appropriate insolvency practitioner and will examine the company's options in the coming days.""Options included a restructuring plan or a sale of the business.""Rest assured the management team and board will leave no stone unturned to secure a future for Gripit,"" the statement said, adding that the company would not be in a position to respond to questions for the next two to three weeks.When contacted by the BBC, the firm, registered as UK Building Products Ltd, issued a statement saying Steven Wiseglass, a director at corporate recovery and insolvency practice Inquesta, was providing assistance to it.""As a result of a number of specific challenges, the company has identified the need to restructure and is examining the options available to it,"" it said.It said the process could take ""a number of months to complete""."
business	'Little sign of change' for number of women in top roles	'One and done''Overcoming barriers'	"There is ""little sign of change"" in women being under-represented in top jobs in business, a government-backed review has found.In the FTSE 350, only 25 women are in chair roles, with fewer chief executives, the Hampton-Alexander Review said.It called for a ""stronger focus"" to address the imbalance.However, FTSE 100 companies are on target for women to make up at least a third of boards by the end of 2020.This year has been the ""strongest year of progress"" for board representation since the review was set up in 2011, said Denise Wilson White, the chief executive of the review.More than 900 women are now on FTSE 350 boards.The review has set targets for women to make up at least a third of boards and a third of senior leadership positions by the end of 2020.Ms White told the BBC's Today programme that the FTSE 250 had had its ""strongest year ever"" and was on course to hit that target.In the FTSE 350 as a whole since 2011, ""we've gone from 152 all-male boards down to only two today,"" she said.However, she added that more progress needed to be made in female representation in top leadership positions, which she described as ""the 50 to 80 most senior jobs in any company"".She said there was ""no shortage"" of capable and competent women able to fill those roles, but problems in company systems meant they were ""just not getting picked in the same numbers"".The chair of the review, Sir Philip Hampton, said: ""Strengthening the number of women in executive positions is critical to achieving long-term gender balance.""We are still a long way from reaching the target for women in senior leadership roles below board level. Unless half of all appointments made this year go to women - our target for 2020 is not going to be met.""Two FTSE 250 firms - property firm Daejan Holdings and software firm Kainos Group - have all male boards, the review said.Daejan Holdings secretary Mark Jenner said the company's position was that the aims of the review were not legally binding and Daejan was under no obligation to comply with them.In addition, he said board positions were filled on merit and there were no current vacancies.The review also found that 39 firms have only appointed one woman to the board, which it called a ""one and done"" approach.These include Domino's Pizza and a number of investment trusts.Companies with more than 40% female board membership include Standard Life Aberdeen, Schroders and Royal Bank of Scotland, while those with 25% or fewer women on the board include National Grid and Rio Tinto.Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said: ""Investors have been consistent in their demands for greater diversity.""It's not just a nice to have. The research is clear: firms with diverse boards and management teams make better decisions, drive innovation and outperform their less diverse peers.""Industry body the CBI said businesses were ""building on last year's progress and continuing to increase diversity in the boardroom"".Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: ""The benefits of a diverse boardroom have been proven many times, from improved decision making to increased profits. If all male boards are to become a thing of the past, firms must not take their foot off the pedal.""However, she added that firms were ""making less progress on the executive pipeline"".""We are still seeing too few women in senior leadership positions, whether as chief executive or running divisions.""Heading into 2020, all firms should ensure they have diverse shortlists and that they're doing everything possible to support people from all walks of life in their careers, from ground floor to boardroom.""The Hampton-Alexander Review is supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Government Equalities Office.Accountancy and auditing firm KPMG is its main financial sponsor.Melanie Richards, deputy chair at KPMG UK, said: ""Behind the numbers and trends are hundreds of individual stories.""Women who have overcome barriers that they should not have had to overcome, with leaders and boards who have worked hard to remove those barriers for current and future generations."""
business	UK's credit rating could be downgraded, says Moody's	'High risk'Analysis: Should we care?	"The UK's credit rating could be downgraded, according to ratings agency Moody's, which says Brexit has caused ""paralysis in policy-making"".It has changed the outlook on the UK's current rating - which is a marker of how likely it is to pay back its debts - from ""stable"" to ""negative"".Moody's also criticised the general election promises to raise spending with ""no clear plan"" to finance it.The UK is currently rated Aa2 - the third highest grade.Credit ratings agencies grade countries and institutions by their credit-worthiness. That in turn can affect the amount that it costs countries to borrow money.Moody's stripped Britain of its top-notch AAA rating in 2013, before downgrading it again in 2017.All the major political parties have committed to ramping up borrowing as part of their general election campaigning.They have said this is to take advantage of low interest rates. Moody's change in outlook suggests this could alter in the future.Jane Sydenham, from Rathbone Investment Management, said: ""The vast spending plans announced this week make the UK look a higher risk prospect from an international debt investors point of view.""Moody's said its concern was that the UK's debt level could rise as a result. ""In the current political climate, Moody's sees no meaningful pressure for debt-reducing fiscal policies,"" it said.Jane Foley, from Rabobank, said to borrow more - without increasing debt levels - you need to see economic growth which is ""a big ask when global growth is slowing and when UK investment has been chased away by political uncertainty"".By BBC business reporter Katie PrescottFollowing the financial crisis the credit ratings agencies were discredited for giving gold-plated ratings to companies that later collapsed.The last time that the UK's rating was downgraded, in 2017, there was little impact on borrowing costs. We are still in the ""A"" band of countries, even if no longer on a par with Germany.So for some in the City, these reports can be easily dismissed. ""It just tells us stuff we already know,"" one investor told me.But the language and timing of this (long-scheduled) report are sobering, coming as it has when politicians are looking to splash out, making big promises about the future of the UK's public services.It ends by saying a downgrade would happen if policy-makers don't have a credible strategy to cut debt. And cutting debt doesn't seem to be on anyone's manifesto.The Moody's report said ""deep divisions within society and the political landscape"" underpin its decision because they are reducing the UK's ability to make policy decisions.It said even if a deal was struck with the European Union over Brexit, that uncertainty over the future of trade is unlikely to diminish.However, the agency said it has decided to hold the UK's current rating because it still saw positives in the economy such as a broad range of economic activity, a sound monetary policy framework and a highly flexible labour market.The Conservative Party said: ""This election is about ending paralysis in Parliament and delivering certainty on Brexit, and our commitment to produce a robust, costed manifesto.""The Labour Party said the biggest dangers to the UK economy were the Conservative Party's ""Brexit deal and stubborn refusal to prepare for the climate emergency""."
business	Royal Mail union to ballot 100,000 workers on strike action	'May not be resolved'	"More than 100,000 Royal Mail staff are to be balloted for possible strike action in a dispute over job security and terms and conditions of employment.Members of the Communication Workers Union will vote in late September, with the result due on 8 October.The CWU says an agreement reached with management last year to raise pay and reform pensions is not being honoured.Royal Mail said it was disappointed the union had chosen to ballot members ""while discussions are ongoing"".The union said: ""In setting this timetable we clearly believe that the business, in spite of their own media campaign, are not working within the spirit and intent of our national agreements and are following their own agenda.""It said this would have ""long-term detrimental effects on our members' terms and conditions of employment, job security and the future of Royal Mail Group as a whole"".Strikes at the privatised postal service were averted last year after Royal Mail agreed to raise pay, reform pensions and reduce weekly working hours from 39 to 35 by 2022, subject to productivity improvements.However, the CWU has claimed that the deal is ""under threat"" under recently appointed chief executive Rico Black.Royal Mail has said it is abiding by the agreement and has awarded two pay rises since last year.It also said it had cut the working week by an hour - although discussions with the CWU about further cuts had stalled.It comes as workers and management prepare for external mediation in a separate dispute about new policies designed to improve parcel handling.Earlier in August, the union warned that this row ""may not be resolved by negotiation alone"".If workers vote to strike it could lead to tens of thousands of staff walking out.However, the union suggested it was still open to settling the row peacefully, with its timetable allowing ""a period of weeks for further dialogue/external mediation"".Shane O'Riordain, head of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, said: ""We are committed to open and constructive engagement with the CWU.""We all want a successful and sustainable company that provides good quality jobs, fairness in workloads, and continues delivering [a nationwide] service."""
business	Facebook shareholders press management on fake news		"For Facebook, it's fake news. But shareholders say it's a real issue.Owners of Facebook stock were rebuffed on Thursday after they called on company leaders to share more information about what they are doing to address the circulation of fake news.They asked the firm to prepare a report on the subject.Facebook maintained a report was unnecessary and would not benefit the company.The proposal, presented at the firm's annual meeting, did not pass. That was expected, since chief executive Mark Zuckerberg controls a majority of the firm's voting power.But Mr Zuckerberg addressed the issue as part of his remarks, pointing to the steps the firm has already taken, including making it harder for fake news spammers to make money from ads.The firm has said it is experimenting with its news feed and testing new features to make it easier to report questionable posts. It also announced plans to hire 3,000 more people to monitor posts.Fake news - is Facebook moving fast enough?Facebook 'observed propaganda efforts' by governmentsHow Facebook is starting to tackle fake news in your news feedMr Zuckerberg said the firm expects to invest more in artificial technology, but the technology is not ""100% there yet"".""The right way to go about this problem is to fight information with more information,"" he added.Facebook faced a backlash after the 2016 US presidential election, when studies found false news was widely viewed through the social media site.Mr Zuckerberg was initially dismissive that fake news shaped the outcome of the election. But the firm has since conceded that it observed propaganda efforts by governments.Natasha Lamb of Arjuna Capital, who presented the fake news proposal at the annual meeting, said Facebook cannot afford to think of itself as a neutral platform.She called the steps Facebook has taken ""too little, too late"".""Investors seek assurance that fake news, fabricated content and hate speech is being handled responsibly over time,"" she said.Company leaders during the question and answer session said they knew fake news was a turn-off for users. They said investors should expect more announcements related to the issue."
business	Brexit deadline passes and still nothing is set in stone	'Overwhelming'No guarantee	"Once again a Brexit deadline has come and gone, leaving business nursing stockpiles of essential product and equipment.Fifty feet under the surface of Dorset, Portland stone miner Michael Poultney described what his business has been been through.""We had to stockpile in March because we were concerned about no-deal. We then obviously had to roll that forward to April.""We felt like they couldn't possibly go for a no-deal in October again, but as it got closer to the date, we got frightened, I got really concerned.Both times the firm had to bring in spare parts for its mining machinery, guessing at which parts might fail. Each time they had to shell out around £150,000 to cover the stockpiling.On top of that Michael's sales have dropped 20% this year. Those Brexit deadlines weighed heavily on his customers' confidence as orders were delayed or cancelled.Meanwhile in Ludlow, workers at bicycle-maker Isla bikes can barely move for the boxes of parts crammed into their factory. They have ordered double the amount they usually would at this time of year. Unlike Brexit, the crucial Christmas period is an ""immovable deadline"".It's not just cash and space that have been devoured. Founder, Isla Rowntree, said the moving Brexit goal posts have been a drain on management time and energy.""We're business people. We're not international economists.""We're experts on bicycles and we're trying to diligently stay up-to-date with everything that's happening to inform our decision-making here.""That's just overwhelming, trying to keep listening to the news to work out what's going on and what it means for us. To have been doing that for well over three years now. It's just exhausting.""It is hard to imagine a time in living memory when business has been so completely at the mercy of politics.A new source of uncertainty has been added to this painful drawn-out process. The resolution of Brexit is now very dependent on the outcome of a general election.There is also no guarantee that an election will break the deadlock - it's possible the narrow parliamentary majority Boris Johnson secured last week in a preliminary vote for his withdrawal agreement could evaporate when parliament is reset.Business owners, including Michael and Isla, are largely grateful that we are not heading over the cliff of no deal tomorrow. But they are deeply frustrated that while the political ground may move in December, business is stuck for now where it has been for more than three years."
business	WeWork ex-boss had 'penchant to smoke marijuana'	Troubled times	"A former WeWork manager has filed a ""charge of discrimination"" against the firm and its co-founder Adam Neumann.Medina Bardhi, his former chief of staff, argues she feared for the health of her unborn baby during her first pregnancy because he smoked marijuana on chartered planesShe says he characterised her maternity leave as ""retirement"" and ""vacation"".WeWork, which has faced upheaval in recent months, said in a statement it would ""vigorously defend itself"".Mr Neumann agreed to step down as chief executive in September saying it was in the firm's ""best interests"" as the office space company raced to find fresh financing.Ms Bardhi's complaint was made to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of herself and ""a class of similarly situated female WeWork employees"".She said was told to leave on 2 October - a week after Mr Neumann stepped aside - which was only months after giving birth for the second time and ""just weeks"" after raising discrimination concerns with management.Ms Bardhi, who joined WeWork in 2014, said she had lost her position and responsibilities to a male colleague during her second maternity leave.She said the discrimination was not new, and she had felt it during her first pregnancy in 2016.Ms Bardhi had decided to disclose the fact she was pregnant early because she could no longer accompany him on business travel.She had been worried for her unborn child ""due to his penchant for bringing marijuana on chartered flights and smoking it throughout the flight while in the enclosed cabin"".When she returned from maternity leave the first time, she was not given her old job back for several months, she said.The company has rejected the claim. In a statement sent to the BBC, it said: ""WeWork intends to vigorously defend itself against this claim. We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind.""In the complaint, Ms Bardhi said it was not just about her as other workers had felt discrimination.""For years, they have been subjected to a work environment in which female employees are demeaned for taking maternity leave, excessive alcohol consumption fuels offensive sexual conduct towards women, and where it is common for women to be paid less than their male colleagues,"" Ms Bardhi said in the complaint.The allegations comes at a time when WeWork has already been facing tough times.The company recently accepted a multi-billion-dollar rescue deal from Softbank after the collapse of its flotation plans and the ousting of Mr Neumann.Mr Neumann received a deal of up to $1.7bn (£1.3bn) to walk away from the company he founded, made up of fees, his shares and help with loans.WeWork leaders have recently also warned of major job cuts ahead."

business	Brexit harming UK industrial strategy, warns top economist		"The Brexit deadlock has undermined efforts to boost the UK economy, the chairman of the government's Industrial Strategy Council has told Newsnight.The council holds the government to account over its industrial strategy.Andy Haldane, who is also chief economist of the Bank of England, said it was ""plausible"" that one of the ""costs of Brexit is that not as much other stuff has happened as might.""But he added that the strategy could still lift the UK's prosperity.The industrial strategy, launched by Business Secretary Greg Clark in 2017, aims to create a more balanced economy by investing in certain sectors to create good jobs.""In the absence of Brexit, might more have been done? Perhaps,"" Mr Haldane told the BBC.But he stressed that the strategy was a long-term project and that skills, infrastructure and investment problems are not solved overnight.""In the grand scheme of things, six months missed here, a year missed there, is less important than sticking to a tried and tested plan,"" he said.Asked how worried he was about a potential no-deal Brexit on 31 October - a prospect that Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson has said he would countenance - Mr Haldane pointed to the Bank's analysis from last year which suggested that, in a worst case scenario, such a rupture could trigger a deep recession.""That was the conclusion we reached then. We've done no updating of that since. That's our best guess - my best guess - as an economist,"" he said.The Bank of England's former governor, Lord King, has criticised the Bank of England's no-deal analysis, rejecting its assumptions on how long transport disruption would last and saying the central bank had been ""unnecessarily drawn in"" to commenting on the subject.Mr Haldane responded: ""We are in a situation of quite considerable uncertainty right now and therefore reasonable people can reasonably disagree on the future course of the economy and what's right and what's not.""Our role - when asked by Parliament - is to put our best analysis in play.""The current governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is due to step down in January 2020 and the Treasury deadline for applications to succeed him closed last week.Mr Haldane, who joined the Bank in 1989, has been spoken of in some quarters as a potential candidate.Asked whether he was interested in the top job, and had put his hat in the ring, Mr Haldane said: ""I've got a job currently. It's a job I love. It's a job it's a privilege to carry out. I'm very happy focusing on just that job right now.""The final choice of candidate is likely to be made by Theresa May's successor.Some analysts have suggested Mr Haldane's chances - who has been unusually outspoken in highlighting the negative economic impact of inequality, the dwindling power of unions and the need for more long-termism in businesses in recent years - would be higher under a future Labour administration.Asked by Newsnight about Labour's plans to re-nationalize utilities such as water and rail services, Mr Haldane said that it was not the job of the council to comment in advance on the merits of individual policies - from either the government or the opposition - but to evaluate them once implemented.But he added: ""This is about forming a view on what works and as importantly what doesn't work. There's no shame, by the way, in policies not working provided you are candid about reaching that judgment and you act in response to it.""You can watch Newsnight on BBC Two weekdays at 22:30 or on iPlayer, subscribe to the programme on YouTube and follow it on Twitter."
business	New National Strategy to tackle problem gambling	'Serious health issue'	"Health bodies, charities, regulators and businesses are being brought together to tackle problem gambling.The Gambling Commission says under its three-year strategy they will cut gambling-related harm ""much faster"".The national strategy focuses on prevention, education and treatment and support for problem gamblers.Ahead of the announcement, two UK betting giants said they would change how they advertise as part of their attempts to deal with the problem.GVC, which owns Ladbrokes, Coral and Gala, and William Hill say they are stopping football shirt sponsorship. GVC is also stopping perimeter adverts.And it has called for an end to all UK sports-betting broadcast advertising, at any time of the day, on live and repeated sporting events.However, GVC's proposed ban on TV advertising did not include betting adverts during horseracing, which is seen as critical to the betting industry's profitability.It follows increasing pressure from regulators and government to make betting companies take action to curb problem gambling.Bookmakers Paddy Power and Betfred both pulled new high stakes roulette-style games after a warning from the Gambling Commission.Gambling profits have been squeezed after the government forced betting companies to lower the maximum stake that can be played on their fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.Last year William Hill was hit with a £6.2m penalty package for breaching anti-money-laundering and social responsibility regulations.The Gambling Commission estimates that about 430,000 people are experiencing problems with gambling.The NHS believes there is increasing evidence of a link between problem gambling and stress, depression and other mental health issues.Marc Etches, head of the GambleAware charity, which contributed to the Gambling Commission's National Strategy to Reduce Gambling Harms, said: ""Gambling is a serious public health issue in Britain with two million adults suffering some level of gambling-related harm, and for a few, gambling addiction ends in suicide.""Commitments by some in the gambling industry to reduce advertising and to increase funding for research and the prevention and treatment gambling addiction are welcome but there is much more that can and should be done across the industry as a whole.""The Minister for Sport and Civil Society, Mims Davies, said: ""Protecting people from harm should be at the heart of every gambling business. Addiction can ruin lives and it is vital that those who need help are given the right treatment at the right time.""Much of the new strategy concentrates on gathering information and research on the effects of gambling. The Commission is considering setting up a National Research Centre and has already started building a national database.William Moyes, chairman of the Gambling Commission, said: ""We all need to better understand the harms that can be caused by gambling, moving away from simply counting problem gamblers and instead build a greater understanding of the harms experienced.""Public Health England will carry out the first review of evidence on how gambling affects public health, which will be published in spring next year.Rosanna O'Connor, director of alcohol, drugs, tobacco and justice at Public Health England, said: ""There is an urgent need to develop a better understanding of these harms and how best to respond to them.""Meanwhile the betting industry has taken steps to curb problem gambling. From August, it will stop TV advertising during most live sport.William Hill launched its ""Nobody Harmed"" programme last year to help prevent problem gambling, and appointed a group director of strategy and sustainability, Lyndsay Wright, to lead it.Philip Bowcock, chief executive of William Hill, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that switching off customers from its gambling systems for safer gambling reasons had cost it an estimated £17m.He wrote that he believed the company should continue to tackle problem gambling: ""If that means taking some short-term commercial hits, so be it. Our future relies on customers who enjoy gambling and stay gambling with us for the long term - and that is dependent on them being safe."""
business	TSB payments delay to customers 'resolved'	'A bit of a meltdown'Bad timing for TSB	"TSB says it has resolved an IT failure which meant wages and other payments were not paid into some of its customers' accounts.The bank says it was due to a ""processing error"" and those affected will not be left out of pocket.But customers complained about being unable to pay their rent and long call wait times when trying to seek help.It comes just days after TSB was criticised over IT failures that hit 1.9 million customers in April 2018.An independent report into last year's incident said the bank's board lacked ""common sense"" as it prepared to switch customers on to a new IT system, which the investigation said had not been tested properly before going live.It is unclear how many customers were affected by the latest problem and exactly how long the system was down.TSB said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.""A number of customers contacted the BBC suggesting the issue went beyond processing of payments, with internet banking and the app down as well.Bob Skinley said: ""I've been trying all morning to get into my internet banking account and can't so looks like they're having a bit of a meltdown yet again.""Sounding horribly like the last fiasco.""Lorna tweeted that her pay had eventually come through.Yanique Sharifa told the BBC: ""I started to notice an issue from yesterday morning. I made a wire transaction that was not showing as it usually does right away. Then I get paid every Friday without fail, I've called and checked if payment was issued. That was confirmed but still I see no money in my bank.""I been on the phone trying to get through to TSB for over an hour and no answer.""The timing of this latest IT error was bad for customers - some of whom were expecting wages or preparing their finances for the weekend - but it was even worse for TSB.Earlier this week, nobody at the bank came out with any credit from the independent report by law firm Slaughter and May into last year's meltdown.Its new chief executive Debbie Crosbie is putting the finishing touches to TSB's new strategy, expected to be announced on Monday.The last thing she wanted was an IT problem that reminded people of a difficult recent past when she hopes to talk about the bank's future.IT glitches are expected in most banks. Regulators call for them to be overcome quickly and without major disruption to customers. Inside the bank, they will be relieved the problems were sorted out quickly this time, but again it has chipped away at its reputation with customers."
business	Snap's chief strategy officer Imran Khan is leaving		"Snap's chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, has become the latest executive to leave the company.His departure comes as the firm, which owns Snapchat, struggles to keep users following the controversial redesign of its app.Last month, Snap posted its first drop in daily users and it has not made a profit since its Wall Street debut.Snap shares have fallen about 40% from their public share offering last year, and closed down nearly 2% on Monday.The company said Mr Khan's departure was not linked to any accounting, management, policy or similar issues and that he was leaving to ""pursue other opportunities"".The 41-year-old plans to help with the transition and has not yet agreed on the date of his last day.The former Credit Suisse investment banker played a key part in taking Snap public after taking on the role of chief strategy officer in 2015.But without a head of business operations, plans to reach profitability by the year end now seem unlikely as the falling number of users could make it difficult for the firm to increase advertising spending on its app.Mr Khan's exit follows the departure of several executives in finance and sales in recent months.Finance head Andrew Vollero and vice-president of monetization engineering Stuart Bowers left the firm in May."
business	Royal Mail fails to halt record £50m Ofcom fine		"Royal Mail has failed to have a record £50m fine from Ofcom overturned.The fine, announced in August 2018, related to its actions in 2014 when Whistl, then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery.Ofcom's investigation followed a complaint by Whistl that Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position.Royal Mail challenged the fine, but on Tuesday, the Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissed its application.An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We found that Royal Mail pursued a deliberate strategy of pricing discrimination against Whistl, which was its only major competitor for delivering business mail.""Royal Mail had a special responsibility to ensure its behaviour was not anti-competitive.""We hope that our fine, which has been upheld in full by the Tribunal, will ensure that Royal Mail and other powerful companies take their legal duties very seriously.""Ofcom's investigation had found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any wholesale customers, such as Whistl, which wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery.Whistl said it was pleased that the Ofcom ruling had been upheld.""Royal Mail's actions had a hugely negative impact on investment in, and the competitive health of, the UK postal sector,"" Whistl said.Whistl said it was now looking at its options to decide whether to seek damages.Royal Mail said it was disappointed by the tribunal's decision.""We are considering all legal options, including whether to seek permission to appeal and to request that payment of the penalty, which would otherwise become payable, be stayed pending any appeal.""We will provide an update once we have completed our legal review,"" it said.It had argued that it raised prices to protect the Universal Service, which means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent across the UK.Unlike its competitors, it is required to continue providing such pricing.The CAT decision was announced as Royal Mail was asking the High Court to stop a postal strike, claiming that the ballot of workers had ""potential irregularities"".A strike threatens to disrupt postal voting in the run-up to the general election, as well as Christmas post.Royal Mail says the the strike ballot ""was unlawful and, therefore, null and void"", but the Communications Workers Union ""refutes"" Royal Mail's claim."
business	Mike Ashley: I want to be one of the big fish		"Mike Ashley has defended Sports Direct's strategy and said he still has faith in High Street retail.""It's going to be a lot smaller pond, but the fish are going to be enormous. I want to be one of those enormous fish,"" he told the BBC.His comments came after a difficult annual general meeting (AGM), where shareholders criticised his strategy.The businessman admitted he had bitten off more than he could chew with the firm's slew of recent purchases.Sports Direct has admitted that last year's £90m acquisition of House of Fraser was a mistake, describing problems at the department store chain as ""nothing short of terminal"".But investors have also questioned Mr Ashley's readiness to buy up a range of other brands including Jack Wills, Evans Cycles, upmarket clothing outlets Flannels and Cruise, and lingerie firm Agent Provocateur. Sports Direct is also in the process of taking control of Game Digital.Mr Ashley owns 62% of Sports Direct shares, but at Wednesday's meeting nearly a quarter of Sports Direct independent shareholders registered unhappiness with his strategy.While Mr Ashley said it was clear that online shopping was eating into High Street sales, he said Sports Direct was not alone in continuing to put its faith in ""bricks and mortar"" retail, citing TK Maxx, Primark and Next.""I'm not a clicks man, I wasn't born in the clicks era,"" he said. ""I'm a bricks man, I believe in bricks.""But he said he understood shareholders' unhappiness at recent events., which include a more than 20% drop in the firm's share price over the past year, a chaotic delay to publication of its annual results, a surprise €674m (£605m) tax bill in Belgium and the resignation of its auditing firm.""If I were a shareholder I would would be very frustrated by those events,"" he admitted. ""It's not acceptable.""Mr Ashley also said he had an ""obsession"" with appointing one of the top four accountancy firms to replace Grant Thornton.However, at the AGM shareholders were told that the firm had still not appointed a new auditor. In such circumstances the government can step in to appoint an auditor, a move which Mr Ashley said he would not oppose as long as the firm was of sufficient calibre.He said he was determined to appoint one of the largest firms to rehabilitate Sports Direct's reputation.""If you're Sports Direct and you're always accused of X, Y, Z, you run it on the back of a fag packet, you say lets have a top four auditor and lay out the dirty washing you'll find its very clean,"" he said.Mr Ashley said if one of the big four took on the challenge of being Sports Direct's auditors he would pay them £2m and they would only need to cover one year."
business	Thomas Cook: Former bosses deny responsibility for collapse	Profit warningsBonus	"A former Thomas Cook chief executive has denied contributing to the collapse of the travel firm.Manny Fontenla-Novoa told MPs looking into the demise that a series of acquisitions under his watch had not left the firm with unmanageable debt.But Harriet Green, who succeeded him, told the hearing on Wednesday she inherited a ""huge wall of debt"".The most recent chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has also blamed debt as a contributory factor in the collapse.Mr Fontenla-Novoa told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee that his strategy, including acquisitions such as a 2007 merger with MyTravel, had left the company ""in great shape"" for future growth.When challenged by committee chair Rachel Reeves, who cited evidence to MPs by Mr Fankhauser that he had ""had his hands tied"" and found his job ""impossible"" due to the debt, Mr Fontenla-Novoa said: ""I can't accept that, because if Peter felt that, then maybe they should have done something about that debt.""They should have looked at what we did in 2010 in disposing of some assets. Maybe they should have done that earlier. If they'd believed that they could not service that debt, they should have done something about it before 2019.""Mr Fontenla-Novoa said that from about 2011, after he had left the business, Thomas Cook ""shrank capacity"" in real terms by reducing the number of available seats on aircraft or hotel rooms.""You look at turnover in 2010, it was £9bn. You look at turnover in 2019, [it was] £9bn, which in effect, because of inflation, capacity has gone down,"" Mr Fontenla-Novoa said.""In the same period of time, Jet2holidays have grown from nowhere to four million passengers a year. On the Beach have grown from nowhere to 1.6 million passengers a year. Love Holidays, similar amounts. I believe there was growth in the market. I believe we would have grown with that growth in the market. Instead, Thomas Cook... has shrunk, competitors have grown.""Ms Reeves cited Mr Fankhauser's comments that Thomas Cook could not have grown because it was spending £150m to £170m per year servicing debt.However, Mr Fontenla-Novoa said it ""was not about buying businesses or investing in technology, it's about the capacity that you put onto the marketplace.""Former chief executive Harriet Green said she had inherited in 2012 ""three profit warnings, a huge wall of debt, and a business model that was entirely out of sync with the industry.""""That's what I fought for 28 months, 22 hours a day, to change. And my responsibility is that I failed to complete that. This is a brand that was loved, with staff as loyal and as amazing as I've seen anywhere in the world,"" she added.Ms Green, who now works for IBM, said she had implemented a strategy that was more focused on technology, but was asked to leave her post by the chairman before she had fully implemented it.Thomas Cook, whose founder was born during the Industrial Revolution, was Britain's oldest holiday company before going into liquidation in September. This put around 9,000 UK jobs at risk and left 150,000 holiday-makers overseas, who were repatriated at an estimated cost of £100m to the taxpayer.Mr Fankhauser last week told MPs on the committee that the company was dragged down by its debts, which reached over £1.4bn in 2018. ""I'm sorry for not being able to turn around this company at pace and to really pay back this debt.""Since 2012 we paid £1.2bn of interest costs and refinancing costs. Imagine if we had only half of that reinvested in the business, we could have been faster,"" Mr Fankhauser said.Former senior Thomas Cook executives told the BBC the company's debt problems began with the MyTravel merger. ""We were told we're carrying this debt from a deal that was done many years ago and now we've got this baggage around our necks,"" said one former executive, who asked not to be identified.""What that means is we have to sell about 2,000 holidays to even pay a very small piece of that debt back. What we're doing is essentially working to pay back the interest,"" she said.The year after the MyTravel deal, Mr Fontenla-Novoa was awarded a £5m bonus. He said it was ""not for delivering the deal"" but ""for delivering the synergies"". He said ""those synergies were not just delivered, they were audited by external auditors""."
business	Brexit badger sets out his strategy	Industrial StrategyFading optimismLoud and clearSticking at it	"Listeners to Radio 4's Dead Ringers will be familiar with the caricature drawn of David Davis - the self-styled ""Brexit Bulldog"".A minister patriotically and publicly straining at Theresa May's leash to defend the UK's interests in a dog fight against the rest of the EU. It's a funny, well-executed, if crude, portrait.If Mr Davis is the bulldog, then Business Secretary Greg Clark is the Brexit badger.Not normally seen in public but busy under cover - padding between the boardrooms of businesses here and abroad to reassure them that investing in the UK is a good idea and all will be well in the end.That is not an easy brief with Brexit looming and negotiations making little, if any, substantial progress to date.And yet, Mr Clark has scored some memorable wins.In the weeks after the referendum vote, he managed to persuade a wavering Nissan to build not one, but two new models in Sunderland - securing 7,000 jobs for the carmaking industry.I can report that the mood music from insiders in the pharmaceutical industry has turned from decidedly anxious to cautiously optimistic about the future.How has he managed it? And perhaps more importantly, can he keep it up as the Brexit clock ticks down with dwindling chances of trade talks this side of Christmas?Everyone hears talk of the ""industrial strategy"", but very few people seem to know what those words mean.Government officials and civil servants talk about it as ""an approach"" to be understood, rather than a document to be read. So I sat down with Mr Clark - its author or architect - to achieve enlightenment.The first thing to understand, he said, is that it's about more than dishing out government money.To take the car industry as an example. There was a bit of money put into battery development but there was also a collaboration with Formula 1's testing facilities around Northampton, permission to use public roads to test self-driving cars, funding for a research facility in Warwick and a commitment to review and explore the law around any insurance issues that may present themselves.""Most of the investment always will come from the industry itself,"" said Mr Clark. ""What I am determined to do is to give the confidence that this is the right place to invest, because we are creating an environment for the future that is going to be the best in the world for some of these big new technologies.""The government intervention in pharmaceuticals and life sciences follows a similar blueprint - £146m to invest in several high tech programmes around the country, getting the University of Birmingham involved and a commitment to use the NHS as a test track for some of the industry's newest medicines.The strategy is to pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff.Bingo - private investment will flood in.Both Mr Clark himself and his approach are popular in the business world. I've heard him variously described as ""bright"", ""thoughtful"", ""a good listener for a politician"" and ""hard-working"".But for all that, the evidence that the strategy itself is working is mixed. In fact, the investment numbers for the car industry in particular are very worrying.According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, investment in the automotive industry has fallen from £2.6bn in 2015, £1.7bn in 2016 and just £322m for the first six months of this year. That's a massive 75% fall in two years.However, Clark said: ""The Engineer's Employers Confederation have reported a rise in confidence. You have to remember that automotive investment is very lumpy. It comes in big chunks.""He needs another big chunk soon.The initial optimism has begun to fade with even Nissan's Carlos Ghosn threatening to reconsider future investments if frictionless trade is not secured. All eyes are now on what the new part-French owners of Vauxhall (PSA Citroen) decide to do with Ellesmere Port and Luton.As a minister, it is hard to reassure businesses when you can't tell them what the trading relationship will be between both their nearest, biggest and richest market and most of their supply chain.His other job, of course, is to carry messages the other way - from the boardroom to the cabinet table.Before the recent election, the voice of business didn't get much of a look-in. In fact, the tone was at times was fairly hostile.Mr Clark is adamant the concerns of business are now getting through loud and clear.""The negotiations around Brexit are of vital importance and I will represent very strongly the needs and the requirements in high level and in detail of British business, that is my job,"" he said.I asked him whether it was him and Chancellor Philip Hammond versus the rest?""No, I would say all of my colleagues absolutely see that the future prosperity of the economy and the future well-being of every single person in the country depend on having a flourishing business environment here,"" said Mr Clark.Apart from a pep talk and a reprimand for housebuilders and energy companies, Theresa May's conference speech was much softer in tone towards business this year.Neither Mr Clark's talent as a go-between nor his work ethic are in doubt in business circles. What is unclear is whether any industrial strategy, however brilliantly conceived and executed, can offset the uncertainty created by a Brexit process that is proving as frustrating for business as it is for politicians.But Mr Clark is an optimistic sort. He tells a story of his times deputising for former chancellor George Osborne at meetings of finance ministers in Brussels.""Often we were so far apart, I sometimes wondered why we bothered calling a meeting, but usually in Brussels there is a lunch involved and over that, personal relationships tend to warm up.""Then there is a bit of progress made and then after another break, some more, and then by the evening, it's amazing how much closer we have all become and how much common ground has been achieved.""So the answer to unlocking the Brexit is a boozy lunch? ""I'm not sure about the booze - but sticking at it helps.""Badger-like?""I'm not particularly nocturnal,"" he said. ""But what I am trying to do with business and investors is to get to know them, to understand them to listen to them and to tenaciously do whatever is right for the UK economy.""Close enough."
business	Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?	China advancesScaling backWill it work?	"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead.The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies.It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China.He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those.""He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry.""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans.In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf.The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end."
business	Debenhams unveils turnaround strategy	'Fit for the future''Disappointed'	"Department store group Debenhams has announced a turnaround strategy aimed at boosting its appeal as a ""destination"" shop and improving its online service.The plan means up to 10 of its 176 UK stores may be closed over the next five years.A central distribution warehouse and about 10 smaller warehouses could also be shut.Meanwhile, the group said its half-year pre-tax profits fell by 6.4% to £88m.Debenhams shares were down by nearly 5% following the announcement.Chief executive Sergio Bucher, who joined the company last October, said its customers were changing the way they shopped and therefore Debenhams was also changing.""We will be a destination for social shopping, with mobile the unifying platform for interacting with our customers,"" said Mr Bucher, who was appointed with a view to shaking up the business.Debenhams said that leisure activities accounted for an increasing share of consumer spending and that the ""leisure experience is an important part of shopping"", while ""mobile interaction"" was growing fast.In an effort to capture this market, Debenhams plans to step up investment in its in-store cafes, restaurants and beauty services.Retail analyst Steve Dresser, of Grocery Insight, said it would be tricky for Debenhams to make its new approach work.""Without a core reason to visit Debenhams, or a point of difference, footfall and sales fall, which in turn impacts profitability,"" he said.""Shopping centre locations overcome footfall concerns, but in turn, rents are expensive.""Debenhams said it had no ""tail of loss-makers"" in its 176 UK store estate and, in fact, many were ""highly profitable"".However, it added, it wanted to ""ensure they are fit for the future"".The 10 stores under review for closure, if they are deemed not profitable enough, have not been named.Debenhams said the rest would be ""refreshed"" and ""remerchandised"" to raise their profitability.In January, it began ""decluttering"" its stores by reducing the number of lines for sale.It is also switching about 2,000 of the stores' backroom staff to jobs where they deal directly with customers.The group also has plans to open four new shops in the UK.Debenhams has 82 stores in 26 other countries.It said it would leave some ""non-core"" international markets, with details due to be announced in October.The department store chain announced earlier this year that it had begun consulting on the closure of one central distribution centre in Northamptonshire which employs about 200 people.It is hoped all staff will be redeployed.Debenhams is also consulting on the closure of about about 10 smaller regional warehouses which are connected to stores.Those staff will be moved into the stores.Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Debenhams, said ""this is a strategy about growth"", not job losses, and that the plans should lead to the creation of more jobs.However, independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said he was ""disappointed"" that the strategy did not include any targets for sales and profits, despite the talk of growth and efficiency."
business	What does the US want from China? What is its endgame?		"There are increasing hopes in Washington and Beijing that an agreement to help resolve the US-China trade war could soon be in sight. But this is a rivalry between two superpowers that is about much more than just trade, it is one that spans economics, defence, culture and technology.So what does the United States want from China - and what is the US endgame?The short answer is the phase-one trade deal that President Trump and the Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He shook hands on in the Oval office last month. But tensions between the two countries go far deeper than just trade, and no one I've spoken to in Washington thinks that this outline deal will make much difference on its own.There has been a pronounced negative shift in attitudes to China in the US in recent years, and it's important to realise that this shift predates Mr Trump's arrival in the White House.""I think if you'd seen a Hillary Clinton presidency, or another Democrat or another Republican in 2016, you would have seen this sharp turn,"" says Daniel Kliman, a former senior adviser at the US defence department.""There was a sense that our approach to China wasn't working,"" says Dr Kliman, now director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).There are many reasons for this rise in tensions. The promised economic benefits of China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 never materialised, says Ray Bowen, who worked for the US government as an economic analyst from 2001 until 2018.China never intended to play by the rules, he says. ""It's more the case that China intended to join multilateral fora in order to begin to shift how multinational fora regulate global trade."" In other words, China joined intending to change rather than be changed.The result was a vast wave of job losses and factory closures in the US known as the ""China shock"". The so-called ""rust belt states"" that voted for President Trump in 2016 bore the brunt.Many US companies moved production to China to take advantage of lower labour costs. However, according to Daniel Kliman there was a high price for companies moving to China: ""China has forced them to hand over their technology, their intellectual property,"" he says.And, even those companies that didn't relocate production found that China somehow got hold of their trade secrets. Law enforcement agencies in the US have a long list of charges against Chinese individuals and companies for spying and computer hacking.The FBI's director, Christopher Wray, recently told US Congress that there are currently at least 1,000 current investigations into the theft of intellectual property from American firms that lead back to China.The US government has estimated that the total value of intellectual property stolen by China in the four years to 2017 alone to be $1.2tn (£936bn).According to Dean Cheng of the Heritage Foundation, a US conservative think tank, this is the primary reason relations between the US and China have soured.""When companies are finding out that their patents are being rifled through, when their product is being reverse engineered, when their R&D processes are being hijacked, more and more companies concluded that partnering with China was not turning out to be profitable, and could actually be downright negative,"" he says.From inside government, economic analyst Ray Bowen says he noticed the mood change in late 2015. People who had previously advocated engagement with China were now alarmed to see how fast China was catching up.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more Rivals featuresAt the same time in the Pentagon, Brig Gen Robert Spalding was leading a team of people trying to formulate a new national security strategy to deal with China's rise and influence. He has since left the military, and has written a book called ""Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite Slept"".When asked about the threat that China poses to US interests, Gen Spalding's reply is stark. ""It's the most consequential existential threat since the Nazi party in World War Two.""I think it's a far greater threat than the Soviet Union ever was. As the number two economy in the world, its reach, particularly into the governments and in all the institutions of the West, far exceeds what the Soviets could ever manage.""The result of Gen Spalding's work at the Pentagon was the National Security Strategy, published in December 2017. It's regarded as the lead document within government, designed to guide every department, and represents a profound shift in approach according to Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""There has now been a movement away from the war on terror, and instead, competition among major powers has taken the place of terrorism as the major threat to the United States,"" she says.The US defence department now believes that addressing the rise of China is one of the major military objectives of the United States in the coming decades. The speed with which China built, and then militarised, a string of artificial islands in the South China Sea in defiance of international law has alarmed many in Washington.According to Dean Cheng, $5.3tn of trade passes through the area every year. ""China's actions were in a sense an attempt to be able to cut the carotid artery of global trade,"" he says.China has been very clear in its ambitions to lead the world in the important technologies of the future, like robotics and AI. ""This is very core to the competition now,"" says Bonnie Glaser, ""because if China were to succeed in these areas, then it probably would supplant the United States as the leading power in the world.""That is what is now at stake. America's military supremacy is based not on a huge standing army, but on high-tech weapons systems. If China takes the lead in these crucial technologies, then the US may not be able to keep up for long.Daniel Kliman believes that the non-military technological race is also crucial. ""Not only is China perfecting technologies for surveillance and censorship at home, but increasingly exporting these technologies as well as finance and knowhow abroad.""He believes the battle with what he calls ""high tech authoritarianism"" is one that will become more and more central to the conversation about China.So, don't expect the US position on China to change in the near term, even if President Trump loses the coming election. The mood in Washington has changed.The only real political conversation is not about whether to take on China but how best to do it. Many Democrats prefer engaging with allies against President Trump's unilateral approach. However, most Democrats know there are few votes to be had by advocating a softer China policy.Rivals - America's Endgame, will be broadcast on BBC World News on Sat 9 November at 07:30 and 19:30 GMT and Sun 10 November at 11:30 and 16:30 GMT. It will be available to UK viewers on iPlayer from 17 November."
business	Manufacturers call for Brexit strategy rethink		"The government should rethink its Brexit strategy, following last week's election, according to the engineering industry organisation, the EEF.It said without a more pro-business stance, the resulting political instability may force more firms to alter their plans ""away from the UK"".The EEF is the latest business organisation to call for a rethink of the government's Brexit plans.It wants access to the single market to be at the heart of Brexit negotiations.The EEF said even before the election firms were already altering or thinking about changing their business plans because of the Brexit vote.Terry Scuoler, EEF chief executive, said the government had already ""wasted a year"" and needed to ""move away from its previous rhetoric and start repairing relations with EU partners"".For the EEF that meant putting access to the single market and staying in a customs union at the centre of the government's negotiations and involving business groups in the talks over trade.It is also calling for a ""suitable"" transition period to be ""firmly back on the table"" as part of the Brexit talks.On Monday Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, called for the government to ""reset"" Brexit negotiations, which are due to start next week.Meanwhile, the uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink ""through the floor"", according to the Institute of Directors.A snap poll of 700 members of the lobby group found a ""dramatic drop"" in confidence following the hung parliament.The main priority for the new government should be striking a new trade deal with the European Union, according to the IoD.Business groups such as the CBI and EEF believe the election result has weakened the hand of those wanting a ""hard Brexit"", which would involve leaving not just the EU but also the single market, customs union and escaping the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.They favour a deal that would give British business much the same access to the rest of the EU as they enjoy now and seem to be freshly emboldened to press their case."
business	Business leaders demand answers over Brexit strategy	'Delay negotiations''Fast out of the blocks'	"Business leaders are demanding a new direction for Brexit negotiations in reaction to the General Election.The Federation of Small Businesses has called for a delay in the start of talks due to the political fallout.Aston Martin has warned that future investment could be at risk without clear indications for future EU relations.And other groups have insisted new ministers refocus their positions ahead of the start of official Brexit talks.Few individual chief executives or companies have commented on the shock election result, with many privately waiting to see how a potential Conservative-DUP coalition is formed.But the boss of luxury car maker Aston Martin, which has invested heavily in a new plant in Wales, spoke out.Chief executive Andy Palmer said: ""We cannot stress strongly enough the need for rapid and decisive policy direction.""Clarity over our relationship with Europe must be established quickly together with the wider reassurance to our key trading partners that Britain remains a dynamic and thriving business environment.""Lobbying groups representing small and large organisations across the country were quick to call for a renewed focus and more specifics on Brexit.Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""Businesses have shown in the last year that they are resilient to surprise results, but they have now been thrown into political limbo.""Now is the time to move on from the rhetoric of the election campaign and focus on preparing for Brexit talks. The issues of access to EU markets and the need for skilled workers are still paramount.""His views were echoed by the FSB, which went further in calling for a delay to negotiations.FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""It is important to go into the Brexit talks from a position of strength, focused on getting the best deal possible for trade and access to workers and skills.""We call for a delay to the scheduled start of negotiations rather than a rush to begin in 10 days' time.""The need for a transition period now becomes even stronger, providing the time to get Brexit right.""Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: ""The Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink.""Industry should be at the table, alongside whatever administration is formed, to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that's been sadly lacking until now.""Elsewhere, Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, and her counterpart at the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, both demanded clear objectives over Brexit.Ms Fairbairn said: ""With only 10 days before Brexit talks begin, the UK needs to be fast out of the blocks.""Agreeing transition arrangements and guaranteeing EU citizens' rights should be early priorities to get the talks off to a good start and show to the world that trade and people come first.""Mr Marshall added: ""No business would walk into a negotiation without clear objectives, an agreed starting position, and a strong negotiating team. It is hard to see how Brexit negotiations could begin without answers on these important questions.""Official Brexit negotiations are due to start on 19 June in Brussels."
business	Industrial strategy 'must help' UK creative industries		"Creative companies are becoming increasingly important to the UK's future economic success and should be at the heart of the government's new industrial strategy, a trade body says.The Creative Industries Federation says film-making, music, advertising and video games are all big export earners but are often overlooked by ministers.It says enterprise zones, tax breaks and access to finance could help firms.The business secretary says he was committed to a ""deal"" with the sector.The role of the UK's creative industries, which also includes theatre, architecture, broadcasting, fashion, museums, and galleries was recognised when the government unveiled its industrial strategy Green Paper in January for boosting the post-Brexit economy.The Creative Industries Federation says ministers need to ""overhaul"" their approach.The federation has unveiled a blueprint of policy recommendations for the creative industries which it says is ""the fastest growing sector of the UK economy"".It said the creative economy supports 2.9m jobs, a rise of 5.1% between 2014 and 2015.Brexit means it is now ""even more crucial"" for the sector ""to deliver more jobs, trade and exports"", it adds.The federation's chief executive, John Kampfner, said: ""There has been a tendency to dismiss the creative industries as something lightweight while claiming the glory of billions of pounds in trade that comes from hits such as War Horse, Sherlock and Slumdog Millionaire.""He said the government should recognise that creative industries ""will be as important to future economic success as traditional industries, such as cars or oil and gas"".Among its other recommendations are campaigns to increase diversity in employment in the sector and advice for start-ups on exporting.Business Secretary Greg Clark said creative industries contributed nearly £90bn to the economy in 2015.He said TV producer Sir Peter Bazalgette is carrying out an independent review of how the sector ""can help drive prosperity across the country by developing new technologies, capitalising on intellectual property rights and encouraging creativity from people of all ages and backgrounds"".He added: ""Through our industrial strategy I want to ensure we build on this sector's strengths, which is why we have committed to an early sector deal for the industry in our green paper."""
business	Trump in the Philippines: The island nation with the clues to US strategy	A brief history: 'Frenemies' foreverBut change is afoot in the balance of powerThis is where North Korea comes inSo there is still common ground	"For most Asian leaders, it would be fair to say that Donald Trump is an enigma. But could the key to understanding US objectives in the region lie with an island nation known for its chaotic politics - the Philippines?If you're surprised, don't be.It's been clear for some time that the Philippines is a nation stuck between the US and China, a proxy, if you will, for the position many Asian countries now find themselves in.While his tour has certainly been about trying to show the region that the US is to some extent still engaged in Asia, it's obvious the American president cares deeply about two issues: North Korea, and trade. And if we're honest, North Korea, is probably his most pressing concern.So how could the Philippines unlock any solutions to what Donald Trump wants from Asia? And what does the Philippines need from the US in return?First, history matters. You've got to know the past, to understand the present. The Philippines and the US have a long and difficult relationship, starting with the Philippine-American war in 1899 that lasted three years. It resulted in thousands of deaths on both sides - but the Filipinos suffered most.The US decision to annex the Philippines was controversial at best. It was partly motivated by the Age of the Empire - countries planting flags wherever they could, colonising other nations to mark as their own.But it was also motivated by America's desire to have a strategic place in the Asia Pacific region - to protect the US mainland from invasion, and to protect its commerce.Sound familiar? Fast forward 100 years and not much has changed. Eventually the US granted the Philippines independence in 1946, but kept its military bases in the archipelago, ostensibly to keep an eye on what was going on in the neighbourhood.Post-independence Philippines has had an on-off-on-again relationship with the US. Protests over what was seen as American imperialism marked the 1980s and 1990s, and the combination of anti-American sentiment as well as a natural disaster in 1991 drove some US bases to Guam and elsewhere in the region after that.Still, the war on terror and Islamic insurgencies in the Southern Philippines and the South China Sea issue have brought the two nations closer together again - with the resurrection of temporary US military bases in the Philippines.China changed the game when it catapulted its way to become the top trading partner for Asian countries, including the Philippines.Beijing is also making inroads into the Philippines with its Belt and Road investments, and has pledged $9bn worth of investment there.And while the Philippines was at one point actively fighting China's claims in the South China Sea - and even took its case to an international tribunal and won - under President Duterte's watch it has basically ""rolled over"", says Carl Thayer, director of Thayer Consultancy in Sydney.""No one besides Cambodia has gone as far as Duterte has to placate China,"" adds Mr Thayer.So does that mean the US has lost the war for influence in the Philippines - and by proxy, Asia? Not quite, he points out.""The US helped the Philippines fight the Islamic State in Marawi and that has kept them in the game."" Mr Thayer has also written about how well President Duterte is playing both China and the US against one another to his advantage - a strategy other Asian leaders are likely to use as well.Cast your mind back to when Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would stop trading with any country that does business with North Korea. As I wrote at the time, that was an unrealistic move - mainly because it would hurt the US more in the long run. But even stranger, was the reaction of the Philippines.Trade between Manila and North Korea jumped by 170% in 2016. And when that news started making headlines, the Duterte government took measures to rectify this imbalance almost immediately by cutting off trade with North Korea.Why the rush? None of the other countries on that list jumped into action immediately, and it's not like the US was telling Manila to get its house in order.Well, one reason is that the Philippines wanted to make sure it was on the right side of the UN sanctions, and that none of the money Pyongyang was making from Philippine trade, was being ploughed back into the weapons industry.But a more pragmatic reason goes back to trade: the Philippines does at least $8bn worth of trade with the US every year in comparison to the $53m with North Korea, so it's far too much of a risk not to do what the US wants.Still, it was interesting to hear an emotional appeal recently from President Duterte about North Korea's Kim Jong Un: ""If somebody could just reach out, talk to him and say, 'My friend, why don't you just join me in the table and we'll just talk about things?"" It's unlikely President Trump will see things the same way.One thing the Philippines and the US may well agree on though, is their perspective on matters of human rights. While the Obama administration was critical of President Duterte's war on drugs, in contrast President Trump has said he is going to the Philippines because it is ""a strategically important place"", and a US official has said that the two leaders share a ""warm rapport"".They're often compared to one another, because of their larger than life personalities, and their blunt manner. In return for support on North Korea, President Trump is unlikely to press hard on human rights and extrajudicial killings in the Philippines as his predecessor did - and that will suit President Duterte just fine.So as you can see, the Philippines and the US have a symbiotic relationship.It's not just because the two nations are democracies, historical allies (despite their long and difficult past) and that their two leaders share interesting personality quirks.It's because they are strategically and symbolically wedded to one another, and the Philippines has increasingly become a bellwether for America's position in Asia."
business	MPs: UK government industrial strategy 'not long-term'	Sectoral dealsGovernment coordinationSkills	"The government's industrial strategy shows little evidence of a long-term approach, say MPs.They called the plans a continuation of existing policies rather than the step change that's needed.The Prime Minister highlighted the strategy as part of her plan to create an economy that works for everyone.The government insists that the recent industrial strategy green paper represents an ambitious long-term vision for the UK.The report by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee welcomed the government's ""re-found commitment"" to an industrial strategy.It called Prime Minister Theresa May's rhetoric on the issue a ""significant shift"" from the approach of governments over the past 40 years.""There's tantalising glimpses that there is something significant happening here,"" said committee chairman Iain Wright.But he warned that the government's approach ""appears to be evolutionary"" and reflects a continuation of policies.He warned that ""business as usual"" approach will not achieve the significant shift needed and that the industrial strategy will fall short in providing a framework for future success.The strategy also provides little clarity on how regional rebalancing will work, according to the committee.The green paper offered an ""open door"" challenge to industry to approach government for ""sector deals"".But the report called on the government to step back from this.""One of the things the committee felt quite strongly was that if you just go down a sectoral route you are going to miss the cracks in the middle"" said Mr Wright, the MP for Hartlepool.""And the cracks in the middle could be where the real economic advantages are"".He said the plan could lead to special pleading and that some key areas could miss out.""What happens if something is really important to the UK economy and they don't come forward with a sectoral deal?""Instead the committee wants the government to focus on ""horizontal"" policies that would benefit the wider economy like boosting skills, infrastructure and R&D.It proposed a ""missions"" approach instead, targeting some of the key challenges ahead, from the ageing population to decarbonising the economy.The report also stated that the Prime Minister ""has not yet been able to harness the political will across government to drive forward her ambition"".It highlighted the recent housing white paper, which it claimed failed to spell out how the government and the construction industry would work together to tackle the housing shortage.""The early evidence on things like the housing green paper are not positive in terms of collaboration across government,"" said Mr Wright.""How are we going to avoid the silo-based approach that most government departments have, to really co-ordinate government activity in a single direction?""The MPs said that proposals in the green paper on skills ""leave much to be desired.""""After six months in development we expected more than a disappointing combination of re-announcements, continuations of existing policy, and vague aspirations,"" the report said.The committee warned that businesses will need to continue to bring in skilled workers from abroad after Britain has left the European Union.""In the context of negotiations over free movement as part of withdrawal from the EU, government must ensure that businesses continue to be able to access the skills they need,"" it said.The department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that the recent green paper is the beginning of an open dialogue to develop the strategy.In a statement it said: ""Our modern industrial strategy represents an ambitious long-term vision for the UK that will build on our strengths as a country and deliver a high-skilled economy for the years ahead"".It added that it would consider the findings of the report carefully."
business	Industrial strategy: A helping hand, not taking the wheel		"The mystery of what was said to Nissan to get it to commit to further investment in Sunderland may be unravelled today.As part of the government's Green Paper on industrial strategy, it's expected that electric vehicles and battery technology will be identified as prime candidates for additional government investment. By way of coincidence, that is precisely what Nissan wants to build on, after investing £26m in battery technology a year ago today.Nissan, it seems, is the perfect example of how to get government support by getting regional, sector and skills needs closely aligned. That's the way to do it under the government's new industrial strategy.The words ""industrial strategy"" send a chill through those industry veterans old enough to have been working in the 1970s. Millions were poured into firms like British Leyland and British Steel - all to no avail.The government's record at picking winners or identifying ""national champions"" is pretty poor. Under Thatcher, the government tried to get out of the way. Regulation was reduced and unions were diminished in the hope that animal spirits of business ambition would lead to growth and prosperity.It did - for some. Financial services, for example, underwent a revolution while primary industries like steel and coal declined.If we have learnt anything about ""Mayism"" it's that she doesn't think the benefits of business success will percolate through the country without a bit of a push from government.Her business minister, Greg Clark, is also no believer in total freedom of the market. Today's industrial strategy is an attempt to lend a helping hand without having both on the steering wheel. The best way to do that, thinks the government, is to provide something that just about everyone agrees is needed and provide it in a location-appropriate way to sectors where we are already pretty successful.A lack of skills is a perennial gripe of British business. Added to possible future restrictions on hiring from the EU and many businesses worry where they will get the right staff from.Today's Green Paper attempts to address those concerns with a promise of £170m to beef up technical education by funding new colleges and replacing a plethora of courses - seen by business as low quality - with fewer higher quality courses designed to fit the needs of employers in the surrounding area. This emphasis on localism with skills and infrastructure spending, attempts to recognise that what's right for Birmingham is not right for Cornwall.Business has a number of other concerns, primarily of course what our relationship with our biggest trading partner, the EU, will eventually look like. Given the political imperative to reduce immigration from the EU, it seems sensible to conclude that it will be harder to hire people from outside the UK. Home grown skills are both desirable and may be increasingly urgent.However, there are other big questions for the PM and her business secretary to answer. For example: is it a good thing or a bad thing to see our very best businesses (e.g. ARM Holdings, Skyscanner) sold off at bargain rates to foreign firms?At the moment, the biggest backers of British business winners are rarely British. Is ""open for business"" good for business?"
business	Skincare firm Sunday Riley avoids fine for staff's fake reviews	'Wrong message'	"Sunday Riley, the founder of the eponymous skincare brand, has been reprimanded for telling staff to write fake product reviews to boost sales.The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found Ms Riley directed staff to post on beauty retailer Sephora's website.As part of a settlement, Ms Riley and her firm have been ordered not to post fake reviews in the future.But two FTC commissioners criticised the settlement and said Ms Riley and her company should be fined.The Texas based firm, which makes premium skincare products, was started 10 years ago by Ms Riley.It sells its products around the world, including at Space NK in the UK, and counts Victoria Beckham and British model Jourdan Dunn among its fans.An investigation by the FTC - which was sparked by a whistleblower's post on social news site Reddit - found that between November 2015 and August 2017 managers at the firm, including Ms Riley, submitted fake, positive reviews of its products on Sephora's site.Sephora is a global beauty retailer, selling nearly 300 brands through its shops and website.Sunday Riley employees, including the founder, also created multiple accounts on Sephora using fake identities on a virtual private network in order to hide their company email addresses, according to the FTC.Sunday Riley had become concerned that Sephora was taking down fake reviews because the beauty retailer realised they were coming from the firm's IP address.Ms Riley emailed staff to advise them on how to create fake accounts and told them to ""always leave 5 stars"" when reviewing Sunday Riley Skincare products, and to ""dislike"" negative reviews.According the email quoted by the FTC, Ms Riley wrote: ""If you see a negative review - DISLIKE it. After enough dislikes, it is removed. This directly translates into sales!!""The FTC charged the company and Ms Riley with two violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act.A commission reached a proposed settlement that prohibits Sunday Riley and Ms Riley from posting fake reviews in the future.However, two FTC commissioners who oversaw the case voted against the proposed settlement, and said that by not penalising Sunday Riley or seeking financial redress ""this action does little to address the epidemic of fake reviews online"".In a joint statement, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter of the FTC, said: ""This settlement sends the wrong message to the marketplace.""Dishonest firms may come to conclude that posting fake reviews is a viable strategy, given the proposed outcome here. Honest firms, who are the biggest victims of this fraud, may be wondering if they are losing out by following the law. Consumers may come to lack confidence that reviews are truthful.""The FTC said it will accept comments from the public for 30 days before finalising the proposed settlement with Sunday Riley."

""I think it was inevitable,"" she says, ""it's been owned by a bank for several years now.""In 2008 when things went crash, it was taken into the ownership of Kaupthing Bank. They don't run businesses, they fund them. We've seen the change in that time. it lost its direction, and I'm surprised they hadn't sold it sooner.""Although Ms Millen parted ways with the store that bears her name, she hopes it does survive.""I'd like to think it could. I'd like to leave a legacy behind, it's something I'm very proud of, or was proud of, and it does need a new home now.""""Whoever buys it needs to put it back where it needs to be. The structure right now is not working, and it's the same across many High Street stores working on an old model that no longer works.""Stores need to close, changes need to happen.""Karen Millen was dealt a blow by HMRC in 2017 when she was declared bankrupt at the High Court over an unpaid tax bill of £6m.The bill came from her involvement in a tax planning scheme, the validity of it was successfully challenged by HMRC in 2010.Karen said the bankruptcy was due to poor advice from her accountants. ""By having professionals advise me, I believed and listened to them - that's what I paid them to do,"" she says.""I thought I was taking care of my affairs, I was advised wrongly and it was unfortunate it ended in bankruptcy. It wasn't a case of the HMRC, it was the advice I got initially, it was the case that the banks were bankrupt - where all my money was invested - so I lost it all, and I couldn't pay the tax.""Karen Millen said she was able to bounce back from the decision. ""It was tough; I'm a resilient tough person though,"" she said.""I don't like having regrets, I believe in focusing on the future and learning from your mistakes."""
business	Sourdough or sourfaux? Artisan bread label row erupts	The sheer crust	"Sourdough bread has become a major food trend over the last few years, with loaves flying off the shelves at independent bakeries and cafes, often for high prices.But with major supermarkets now getting in on the act, a row has broken out about what constitutes real sourdough and how it should be made.It's led one campaign group to dub the more commercial - and cheaper - products on offer at many retailers as ""sourfaux"".""We have no problem at all with a supermarket selling genuine sourdough. Just don't cheat, don't fool people,"" said Chris Young, co-ordinator of The Real Bread Campaign.Sourdough has been around in various forms for thousands of years. Proponents believe it is more nutritious and easier to digest than normal bread.Known for its characteristic flavour and texture, it is made with live fermented cultures which act as a natural leavening agent and should not be made with baker's yeast, according to Mr Young.But this week, a coalition of five trade groups representing commercial bakers and restaurants across the country proposed a wider definition, in an industry code of practice designed to clarify the labelling on sourdough products.In it, they acknowledge that any product calling itself ""sourdough bread"" should contain live/active cultures ""as the principal leavening agent"".But they also suggest that such a loaf may contain up to 0.2% of bakers' yeast and certain ""flour treatment agents"".""Where space and skills are lacking, bakers have recourse to an increasing number of ingredients and raw materials that help to simplify the process,"" the guidelines state.The group - which included the Federation of Bakers, among others - has asked food agency Defra to endorse the code, which would be voluntary.But the Real Bread Campaign warned the rules risked ""undermining the integrity of the word sourdough, creating a sourfaux free-for-all"".""When we started nine years ago, there were no sourdough loaves on supermarket shelves, they used to see it as elitist,"" Mr Young told the BBC.""Big firms now see there's a demand. But rather than saying, 'We will bake genuine sourdough and make it more accessible,' they've said, 'Stuff it, we don't want to train our bakers or put in the time it takes to learn. We want to cut corners.'""The kind of independent bakeries represented by the Campaign for Real Bread can charge as much as much as £5-£6 for an artisan sourdough loaf in some UK cities.By contrast, products labelled as sourdough bread retail for a fraction of the price in many supermarkets - and there is no law dictating how such bread should be made, as long as it meets relevant food standards.However, a study by consumer watchdog Which? last year found that just four of 19 supermarket sourdough loaves it tested contained the traditional four ingredients: flour, water, salt and a live yeast starter culture.Mr Young said people would potentially get an inferior taste and miss out on the health benefits. ""This bread may cost less, but supermarkets may still be charging a premium for a non-premium product, which we think is unfair.""The BBC asked the Craft Bakers Association, which is one of the groups backing the new code, for a comment.Meanwhile, Gordon Polson, chief executive of the Federation of Bakers, said: ""A draft of the Baking Industry Code of Practice for the Labelling of Sourdough Bread and Rolls has been presented to Defra.""We look forward to discussing it with Defra as an important step in helping with labelling sourdough, following guidelines which have been established in other EU countries."""
business	Luxury goods join Hong Kong retail slump as protests bite		"Luxury brand Richemont is the latest firm to report a hit to business over ongoing protests in Hong Kong.The Swiss company said political unrest in Hong Kong, a key market for its watches, has knocked sales.Retailers in the territory forecast a sharp sales drop this year due to the protests, while tourism is also suffering.Demonstrators have filled Hong Kong's streets over the past month with more protests expected this weekend.The demonstrations were sparked by a proposed extradition bill which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.But they now reflect broader demands for democratic reform and concern that Hong Kong's freedoms are being eroded.The sometimes violent clashes have disrupted business in the city, a hub for wealthy Asia shoppers.Unrest has forced many stores to close and sparked widespread trading disruption.In a statement on Thursday, Richemont said sales in the Asia-Pacific rose in the three months to June with the exception of Hong Kong, where sales sank due to the recent street protests and the strength of the local dollar.This week the Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKRMA) said most members had seen sales fall during in the past month, and forecast more pain to come.""The unexpected store closures due to the protests not only led to sales loss, but also directly affected retail staff's take-home income, especially part-time staff and those paid on a commission basis,"" the HKRMA said in a statement.The group said July and August are peak business seasons retailers and as protests continue and spread, ""our members forecast a drop by double digit in the next months"".Tourism operators have also voiced their concerns.The Hong Kong Federation of Unions said the number of tour groups from mainland China has declined to 5,641 in June from a monthly average of 7,800 at the beginning of the year, according to reports.The group also said hotel occupancy rates were down as much as 20% in June from a month earlier, and forecast rates could drop 40% this month on the prior year."
business	UK retail sales stall in April		"Retail sales stalled in April, but warmer weather boosted sales of clothing, which offset falls in other areas of spending.The Office for National Statistics said sales in April were flat on March, and higher than the 0.3% fall expected.In the three months to April, sales increased by 1.8%, with a record quarter for the online sector.ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said three-month growth was strong, with warmer weather boosting sales.The data illustrated the changes taking place on the High Street.Sales from online-only retailers rose 9.4% over the three-month period - the highest three-month-on-three-month growth rate since records began, the ONS said, boosted by promotions and sales.""Elsewhere, department stores continued to see their sales fall,"" Ms Murphy said.Department store sales fell by 0.5% and those in household goods stores declined by 2.9%.Compared with a year earlier, sales were up by 5.2% after a 6.7% annual rise in March.The ONS said anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested warm weather in April boosted sales over the period, which included Easter, while economists said the figures showed Brexit was not having an impact on spending.""April's retail sales figures are a timely reminder that political uncertainty is having no discernible impact on households' overall spending. The stability of volumes in April is a good result, following recent strong gain,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""Admittedly, warmer-than-usual weather - average temperatures were 1.1C above their 1970-to-2018 April average - probably temporarily stimulated clothing sales,"" he added.Duncan Brewer, retail partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said sales were boosted ""as consumers went out and spent money over the sunny holiday period"".But, he said, that contrasted to ""continued bad news from our ailing High Streets, which continue to be challenged by the shift to online. Retail used to be simple: consumers went to stores, browsed products, then bought what they wanted"".Consumer spending helped drive the economy in the first quarter of the year and economists look to the retail sales figures as one potential gauge for the impact on economic growth.Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said sales volumes might have been weaker if retailers had not discounted over the Easter period and that growth could slow in the second quarter as household spending eased.""And with other parts of the economy in no position to compensate, this supports our view that growth will moderate a little in [the second quarter] and remain sluggish for the rest of the year,"" she said."
business	Government announces new register for retail landlords		"The government says it will make it easier to find out who owns empty buildings on the High Street in a bid to revitalise the UK's retail sector.It said a new register would allow prospective tenants to quickly check ownership and speed up the letting process.It follows research for BBC Radio 4's You and Yours that found a confusing patchwork of ownership on High Streets.Experts say this is putting retailers off investing in town centres.The research by Estates Gazette (EG), a news and data portal, spanned 22 main shopping streets in 11 UK Cities.It found nine different categories of ownership, ranging from small private companies to corporate giants, based in the UK and overseas.Such fragmented ownership can make it difficult for prospective tenants to find out who landlords are, experts warn.It can also be hard to get landlords to work together on a long-term regeneration strategy for a town centre, which in turn may deter retailers from opening new shops.James Child from EG said: ""Ownership is really coming to fore in terms of the debate around the High Street.""If we need to refurbish a particular area for example, if there's a lot of vacancy, then we need to know who's exactly behind the façade of each shop or regeneration can be very difficult.""Edinburgh has the most fragmented High Street, according to the research.Former leader of Edinburgh City Council, Donald Anderson told the programme the regeneration of Princes Street had stalled because of difficulties getting landlords to sign up to an overarching plan for redevelopment.The British Property Federation, which represents UK residential and commercial real estate companies, says this patchwork of ownership is mirrored around the UK and can be a ""significant deterrent to long-term institutional investors"".Chief executive Melanie Leech said: ""Strong leadership and a genuine commitment to a shared agenda will be needed to overcome it.""A host of High Street retailers have announced closures recently as more people do their shopping online and retailers struggle with high overheads.It has prompted the government to offer relief from business rates, but some argue it should go further.Along with the ownership register, High Street minister Jake Berry said the government was ""working to enhance powers of local authorities to proceed with compulsory purchase orders to end fragmented ownership"".The register will be piloted in individual local authorities."
business	Can Sir Philip Green save his retail empire?	What does the CVA do?What does it solve?Arcadia at a glance:How did Arcadia get into trouble?Will the creditors agree?What about employees' pensions?	"High Street retail chain Arcadia claims to be in serious trouble, facing what it calls ""significant liquidity issues"".The answer, it believes, is a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a series of proposals to its creditors.But critics say it raises as many questions as it answers and fails to address key branding and operational problems in the company.Arcadia, owned by Lady Tina Green, the wife of chairman Sir Philip Green, says sales in its stores open more than a year fell 9% in 2018-19.Earnings this year are expected to be £30m, compared with £219m two years ago.Faced with fixed charges of £100m a year, the group says it is struggling to pay its way.A CVA is a renegotiation of terms with a company's creditors as part of an insolvency procedure.Arcadia's CVA is a complicated, many-headed beast. For a start, it is not one, but seven arrangements relating to different parts of the group.In theory, if one CVA fails, only one part of the company would go into liquidation. The rest would carry on trading.In practice, Arcadia says that the companies are so interlinked that the whole group is unlikely to survive without all seven CVAs being approved.The CVAs propose:The company says it is paying £170m annually in rent. It estimates the leases are ""over-rented"" by 30% on average across the portfolio.But most analysts believe that bill was coming down anyway.Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, says Arcadia has been shrinking for years, closing stores as leases expired, and he said more were expected to close in the next two years for the same reason.The CVA also proposes closing 23 stores, just 4% of Arcadia's portfolio.Mr Hyman said: ""I find it hard to get my head round the idea that closing 23 stores in a group the size of Arcadia is going to make the difference between life and death.""Ed Cooke, chief executive of retailers' trade association Revo, says it demonstrates the problems are not as severe as Arcadia makes out: ""There's no suggestion here that Arcadia is really insolvent.""No-one disputes the company is in poor shape. It says it has suffered from the malaise affecting the whole High Street - higher business rates, the rising national living wage and the fall in the value of the pound, which has put up the cost of imported goods.But Arcadia has problems of its own making, which a CVA does little to address and are largely to do with underinvestment.Many date the problem to 2005 and the £1.2bn dividend paid out of Arcadia's parent company, Taveta, to the Green family.Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, says Arcadia's brands are tired and out of date: ""Even Topshop, which used to be Arcadia's star player, has lost appeal among fashion shoppers, thanks to tough competition from the likes of Zara, Primark and H&M, as well as online ""pure plays"" such as ASOS, PrettyLittleThing and boohoo.com.""""Any attempt to pay for an increase in store standards would be spread too thinly to make up for years of underinvestment.""Mr Cooke believes CVAs generally are being used to manipulate credit arrangements.He said: ""The management stays in place. the business stays the same. Not surprising the landlords are turning round and saying, 'Hang on, why do I have to take a hit when this badly managed business is getting a break?'""The CVAs have to be approved by 75% of the creditors. Without that approval, the company goes into liquidation.In most CVAs, the creditors are usually banks or pension funds, so the landlords find themselves outvoted and their rental income cut. In this case, most of the seven CVAs are linked to the properties and the landlords' votes will be the ones that count.The landlords have also managed to persuade Arcadia to increase their potential stake in the company from 10% to 20%. The equity can only be realised if Arcadia is sold.Clare Kennedy, director at consulting firm AlixPartners (which are not involved in Arcadia's CVA), explained: ""The landlord's argument is that they should be compensated because they have been compromised in order to create value in the company proposing the CVA, and therefore they should benefit from any upside.""Some of the landlords have been reported as wanting as much as a 40% stake in the company, but in the end, their approval of the CVA depends on how much of a cut they are prepared to take on their rental income.PJT, the investment bank negotiating with Arcadia on behalf of a group of landlords, said in a statement: ""There have been substantial improvements made to the CVA... which benefit all landlords, but there are still areas that need further clarity.""Creditors for one of the seven CVAs, which the company calls a ""critical entity"", are not landlords but pension funds.For the purposes of a CVA, the funds are treated as creditors under the control of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF).Two years ago, Arcadia agreed to double the pension scheme deficit recovery contributions to £50m a year for 10 years, to repair a £1bn hole in the scheme.Under the CVA, that £50m contribution would be halved.But Lady Green has committed to pay £25m annually into the funds over three years, plus an additional £25m. On Friday, Frank Field MP urged Sir Philip Green to use his own money to support the pension fund.So the CVA in effect cancels the recovery plan and replaces it with a slightly more generous one for three years, after which, according to a company spokesman, contributions are ""to be renegotiated"".According to John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant, there is some relief that pension contributions would be increased, since some analysts had expected a cut.He said: ""When we thought that the contributions were going to be cut, we thought that's never going to be allowed. But with the increase in contributions, it stands a good chance of being approved.""And after three years? Mr Ralfe is sanguine, adding that by then renegotiation was not unreasonable, since the pensions would have to be re-valued anyway."
business	Sir Philip Green in final bid to save retail empire		"Sir Philip Green has made a last-ditch attempt to save his retail empire from collapse by seeking a less severe rent reduction from landlords of his stores.Earlier this week, a vote on Sir Philip's rescue deal for Arcadia, which includes Topshop, was postponed after some landlords refused to back it.Sir Philip is now asking landlords to agree to rent cuts of between 25% and 50%, instead of 30% to 70%.This shortfall in rent will be plugged by £9.5m provided by the Green family.However, that commitment could rise to up to £29m during the three-year period of the deal.Landlords of the troubled group's stores, which also include Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, were due to vote on the rescue deal, known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), on Wednesday, but it was postponed ""to conduct further dialogue with a few landlords"".As well as rent cuts, the deal would have meant the closure of 48 stores and the loss of around 1,000 jobs.Sir Philip is hoping his improved offer will persuade landlords to back his deal.Arcadia chief executive Ian Grabiner said: ""Having already secured the support of our pensions trustees, trade creditors and a significant number of landlords, we hope these final revised terms will ensure the majority of landlords support the CVA at next week's vote.""Their support is vital for the long term sustainability of the group, our 18,000 employees and our extensive network of loyal suppliers.""It's understood improved terms on break clauses for leases are also being offered.Landlords will be voting again on 12 June.If the deal doesn't pass then Arcadia says the group is very likely to enter administration."
business	Shop worker: 'I am verbally abused on a daily basis'	Violent attacks	"Jackie McKenzie, 56, has worked at a supermarket petrol station in Bathgate, Scotland for the last 20 years.During that time, the amount of abuse she has faced while doing her job has been rising.""I've been verbally abused on a daily basis,"" she said. ""It's getting a bit out of hand to be honest.""She is not alone, according to a new survey, which has found that retail staff are abused, threatened or assaulted on average 21 times a year.A survey of over 4,000 retail staff by shop workers' union Usdaw, found that around two-thirds have experienced verbal abuse, while 41% were threatened by a customer and nearly 5% were assaulted.The trade union has been campaigning to stop abusive behaviour towards retail staff for a number of years and in June called on the government to tackle the problem.""People think that just because we work behind a till there's no reason to respect us,"" said Michelle Whitehead, 46, a convenience store worker in Wolverhampton.""It's terrible to say but you get used to being threatened. When someone comes and shouts at you it does affect you. Sometimes you have to walk away from the counter and count till 10 so you don't burst into tears.""Ms Whitehead, who has been a retail worker for almost three decades, says that incidents used to occur once in a while but now she receives abuse from customers on a weekly basis.She said she often encounters difficulties when dealing with young people who are underage but seeking to purchase alcohol or cigarettes.She has also been spat at for refusing to hand over parcels from the post office counter without proof of ID.Although neither Ms Whitehead or Ms McKenzie have been assaulted, they have witnessed violent attacks.Ms McKenzie said one night, while managing the shop on her own, she witnessed a young man run into the convenience store begging for help and a minute later, another boy had run in and started beating him up.""I shouted to him to stop from behind the counter and pressed the panic button, and the police did come. But by that time the guy had a broken arm and a broken jaw, and the shop was trashed,"" she said.The two workers are campaigning for retailers and the government to make changes so retail staff can feel safe while they are at work.They want signs up in stores telling customers to respect staff, more police on patrol and for retailers to impose a life-time ban on customers who persistently abuse shop workers.Abusive customers should also have to face criminal charges, they said.""If that's the only corner shop you can go to, it might make you think if you could have a life-time ban,"" said Ms Whitehead."
business	Nike to stop direct sales through Amazon		"Sportswear retailer Nike is to stop sales through Amazon so it can focus on selling directly to customers.Nike said it would continue to invest in ""distinctive"" partnerships with other retailers and platforms.It marks the end of a pilot that Nike began with Amazon in 2017.According to Bloomberg, Amazon has been preparing for the move, recruiting third-party sellers with Nike products so that the merchandise is still available on the site.Analysts said it was a sign that Nike was seeking greater control of its brand.Nike said: ""As part of Nike's focus on elevating consumer experiences through more direct, personal relationships, we have made the decision to complete our current pilot with Amazon Retail.""We will continue to invest in strong, distinctive partnerships for Nike with other retailers and platforms to seamlessly serve our consumers globally.""We will continue to partner with Amazon Web Services to power a suite of services on Nike.com and within Nike's ecosystem of apps.""Maureen Hinton, retail research director at Global Data, said: ""It's a case of Nike wanting complete control of its brand"".She said customers using Amazon often had the impression they were getting a discounted price.However, while not many retailers could resist using Amazon, Nike was a ""huge global brand and sports brands have a huge amount of power"".Amazon declined to comment."
business	Retail sales boosted by mild weather in March		"Retail sales unexpectedly jumped in March as mild weather enticed shoppers to UK stores.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the year-on-year growth in March was 6.7% - the highest since October 2016.The ONS said milder weather had helped to boost sales in comparison with the ""Beast from the East"" last year.Monthly sales rose 1.1% - economists had been expecting a fall - with the warm weather boosting clothing sales.Department stores were the only type of stores to report a fall in sales compared with the previous year, seeing a 0.3% decline in March.The problems facing department stores was illustrated by Debenhams, which entered administration earlier this month before being taken over by its lenders.In contrast, food stores registered a 3.3% annual rise, and textile, clothing and footwear stores saw a 7.1% increase from a year earlier.Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: ""March's mild weather boosted sales, with food shops also recovering after a weak February"".February's month-on-month growth figure was revised up to a rise of 0.6% from 0.4%, which Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said ""adds to evidence that the economy grew at a pretty reasonable rate... in the first quarter given the political chaos"".She noted that the ONS adjusted the figures for Easter - the run-up to Easter Sunday fell in the comparable period last year - but that the boost in food sales in March may have been sparked by stockpiling ahead of the original date for Brexit.Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said the third consecutive month of increasing sales was good news for retailers as they headed in to the Easter break after a mixed Christmas.""Those who see drops in reported annual profits as symptomatic of the continued decline of the High Street should look at the contrasting fortunes of some who have sophisticated physical and online presences,"" he said.It is the latest data to be released this week, giving clues to the state of the UK economy.On Tuesday, separate ONS data showed that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.4% in the three months to February and the unemployment rate was lower than at any time since the end of 1975.That was followed on Wednesday by figures showing inflation was stable at 1.9% in March.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said: ""The week's economic releases have ended with good news. Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today's retail sales data show households willing to spend more.""That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit"".Ms Gregory expects retail sales to provide a boost to GDP in the first quarter, but added: ""Of course it is entirely possible that sales will be weaker in the second quarter if no-deal Brexit concerns caused consumers to bring forward purchases in to March""."
business	The retail revolution: How mail order changed middle-class life	Find out moreMore things that made the modern economy:	"""Beware! Don't patronize Montgomery Ward & Co. They are deadbeats!""That was the warning issued by the Chicago Tribune on 8 November, 1873.What had Aaron Montgomery Ward done to convince the Tribune's editorial staff that he was running a ""swindling firm"" preying on ""gulls"" and ""dupes"" in the countryside?Ward's flyers were offering suspiciously ""Utopian"" prices on more than 200 goods. And what's more, Montgomery Ward & Co didn't display those wares in a shop, or employ any agents to sell them.""In fact,"" the Tribune said, ""they keep altogether retired from the public gaze, and are only to be reached through correspondence sent to a certain box in the Post Office.""It seems not to have occurred to the Tribune that Ward might be able to offer his ""Utopian"" prices precisely because he kept no expensive premises and employed no middlemen.But the threat of a lawsuit soon helped the editors to wrap their heads around Ward's new business model, and a few weeks later they printed a grovelling apology. Ward put it on his next flyer.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Still in his 20s, Aaron Montgomery Ward had made his way to Chicago after working as a clerk at a country store, and got a job as a salesman for the future department store magnate Marshall Field.It involved touring more of those rural general stores in farming communities, and Ward realised what a limited selection of goods they stocked, and how expensive they were.The farmers had noticed that, too. They were already exploring other ways to get goods more cheaply to their far-flung rural outposts.Mail order existed, but it wasn't common - just a few specialist firms with a limited line of wares.The opening Ward saw was ambitious but simple: use mail order to sell many things, directly, with low mark-ups on wholesale prices. And let buyers pay on delivery - so if they didn't like what was delivered, they could refuse to pay and send it back.A chastened Chicago Tribune finally got it: ""It is difficult to see how any person can be swindled or imposed upon by business thus transacted.""Ward later gave the world the enduring phrase ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back"".Just two years after rousing the Tribune's suspicions, Ward's flyer had become a 72-page catalogue, listing nigh on 2,000 items.For 55 cents for example, you could buy 250 5in canary-coloured envelopes or twelve dozen small kerosene wicks. For $6.50, you could treat yourself to an extra fine large white woollen blanket. Ward printed testimonials from satisfied customers, some mentioning that he'd undercut their local store by half.Despite being basically just a list of goods and prices, Ward's catalogue was later named by New York literary society, the Grolier Club, as one of the 100 most influential books published in America before 1900, up there with Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Whole Booke of Psalmes.It was, the society said, ""perhaps the greatest single influence in increasing the standard of American middle-class living"".And it inspired competitors - notably Sears Roebuck, which soon became the market leader.The Sears Roebuck catalogue had slightly smaller pages than Montgomery Ward's, because - it was said - a tidy-minded housewife would naturally stack the two with the Sears catalogue on top.By the end of the 19th Century, mail order companies were bringing in $30m a year - a billion-dollar business in today's terms.In the next 20 years, that figure grew almost twenty-fold.The popularity of mail order helped fuel demands to improve the postal service in the countryside. If you lived in a city, you'd get letters delivered to your door, but rural dwellers had to schlep to their nearest post office.The government gave in - and realised that if it was going to send postal workers into the boondocks, it'd better improve the road network, too.""Rural free delivery"" was a huge success, and Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck were among the main beneficiaries.This was the golden age of mail order. Catalogues ballooned to 1,000 lavishly illustrated pages, and new editions were eagerly awaited.Forget canary-coloured envelopes - for $892, Sears Roebuck would send you a five-room bungalow.Strictly speaking, you'd be sent ""Lumber, Lath, Shingles, Mill Work, Flooring, Ceiling, Finishing Lumber, Building Paper, Pipe, Gutter, Sash Weights, Hardware and Painting Material"". And plans of course, which were presumably rather more daunting than the ones you get from Ikea for a Billy Bookcase.Many of these mail order kit houses are still standing, 100 years on. Some have changed hands for more than $1m.The catalogue itself has endured less well.Montgomery Ward and Sears both started building department stores - as wider car ownership made mall shopping more popular, the catalogues became irrelevant.Montgomery Ward nixed the catalogue in 1985, Sears a few years later.Then came the internet: Amazon doesn't feel the need to send you a 1,000-page catalogue every year either.How department stores changed the way we shopHow credit cards changed the way we spendHow market research revolutionised advertisingHow seller feedback helped build eBay, Uber and AirBnBBut if the heyday of the mail order catalogue has long since passed, its dynamics are now playing out in one country all over again.The world's rising economic power. A government building roads and communications infrastructure in isolated rural areas. Customers fed up with existing retail options. Visionary entrepreneurs with new business models that let you browse and order from home.The country is China.For the postal service, read the internet. And the roles of the mail order giants are being played by China's e-commerce titans: JD.com and Alibaba.China has thrown itself into online shopping - its citizens spend about as much online as those of the US, UK, France, Germany and Japan… combined.Last November, Alibaba set new records on Singles Day, its biggest annual shopping event, hitting $1bn (£774m) in sales in just 85 seconds, and almost $10bn in the first hour of the promotion.Singles Day is now the world's biggest online sales event, eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday's totals combined.But drawing rural areas into the economy isn't just about expanding consumer choice and middle-class living standards: when you have good roads and access to information, you have more scope to make and sell stuff.Two economists studied how rural free delivery rolled out in America, and found that when it arrived in a new county, investment in manufacturing soon followed.The same process seems to be unfolding in China, which has its ""Taobao Villages"": clusters of rural enterprises producing everything from red dates to silver handicrafts to children's bicycles.Taobao is an online marketplace, owned by Alibaba. It's basically just a list of goods and prices.But perhaps it can aspire to shape society as much as any titan of literature - like Montgomery Ward.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

business	UK retail sales up but food spending falls		"Retail sales rose in February, up by 0.4% on the previous month, official figures show.But sales at food stores saw the biggest fall since December 2016, the Office for National Statistics said.Separate data showed government borrowing fell to £0.2bn in February from £1.2bn a year earlier.After 11 months of the current financial year, government borrowing stands at £23.1bn, 44% lower than in the same period last year.Unusually warm weather in February contributed to the rise in retail sales, said the ONS, boosting spending at garden centres and on sporting equipment.A decline of 1.2% in food stores was offset by growth in all other main sectors, it added.The ONS's head of retail sales, Rhian Murphy, said strong increases in fuel sales and online shopping had also driven the continued ""bounce back"".She added: ""Food growth slowed, however, due to a significant fall for supermarkets, specialist food and alcohol stores in February after the sales and promotions seen in January came to an end.""Annual retail sales growth in the year to February was 4%.The government borrowing figures, issued separately, are subject to revision. January's figure, which at the time showed a record surplus of £14.9bn, has now been revised down to £13.3bn.In his Spring Statement last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the borrowing forecast for the 2018-19 financial year to £22.8bn, almost £3bn lower than the £25.5bn predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the October 2018 Budget.However, the January revision means that Mr Hammond ""may just miss out"" on his new lower forecast, according to analysis by the EY Item Club.The government needs to borrow the money to plug the gap between what it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects.The OBR expects the improvement in the public finances to continue in future years, helped by stronger tax receipts and lower spending on debt interest.Mr Hammond warned that a disorderly Brexit would deal a ""significant"" blow to economic activity in the short term and pledged to spend £26.6bn to boost the economy if MPs voted to leave the EU with a deal.Public sector net debt at the end of February 2019 was £1,785.6bn or 82.8% of GDP.That was £22.7bn higher than in February 2018, but 1.4 percentage points lower as a proportion of GDP.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With just eight days to go until Brexit and the uncertainty higher than ever, it is reassuring that in February households increased their spending at a decent rate.""And February's public finances data suggest that the chancellor has the cash to splash if there were a no-deal Brexit."""
business	UK retail sales bounce back in January		"Retail sales bounced back sharply in January, rising by 1% on the previous month, official figures showed.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the amount of goods sold rose by 1%, after falling by 0.7% in December, with discounts in clothing helping to boost sales.Compared with a year ago, retail sales were 4.2% higher in January.That was the biggest annual rise since December 2016. The figures beat most economists' expectations.""Clothing stores saw strong sales, luring consumers with price reductions, with food sales also growing after a slight dip after Christmas,"" said ONS statistician Rhian Murphy.The ONS said clothing prices fell by the most since August 2016.The figures suggest that consumer spending may have picked up again after a lull following the summer's World Cup.The findings also echo those from the British Retail Consortium, which indicated that shops saw their fastest sales growth for seven months in January.Other recent data has shown wages picking up after years of stagnation and rising faster than inflation.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""January's jump in retail sales shows that most households have maintained a happy-go-lucky mentality, despite the fraught political situation. While consumers' confidence is down, this reflects rather fuzzy expectations that Brexit might be costly eventually.""But he added that although low confidence would prompt consumers to hold back from buying cars, booking holidays and moving home, he thought the High Street would be protected."
business	Food price inflation highest in almost six years, says retail group	'Chaotic no-deal Brexit'	"UK food prices last month reached their highest rate of inflation in almost six years, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).Extreme weather last year - both cold and hot - hit the planting of crops, pushing up the price of such things as onions, potatoes and cabbages.But the BRC also said the global cereal prices increased the cost of bread.It meant food price inflation hit 2.5% in March, up from 1.6% in February, the highest since November 2013.Overall, shop price inflation rose to 0.9% in March from 0.7% in February, the highest inflation rate since March 2013, according the BRC-Nielsen Shop Price Index.Last year's weather saw farmers contending with delays to planting caused by February's Beast from the East, followed by rain, leading to flooding in some areas in April, and then an extended summer heatwave, affecting crop yields.Rises in the cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks also pushed up the inflation figure.BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson warned there would be no let-up in food price rises if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal.""The bigger threat to food inflation remains the risks of a chaotic no-deal Brexit, which would lead to higher prices and less choice on the shelves,"" she said.""In order to avoid this scenario, parliamentarians from all parties must find a compromise that can command a majority in the House of Commons.""Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said the figures underline the pressures facing food retailers, which have seen slower sales since the start of the year.But he suggested there was some relief for consumers buying non-food items.""For many high street fashion, home and outdoor retailers prices are not increasing, so good news for shoppers as the end of season ranges sell through,"" Mr Watkins said."
business	Sears retail chain in $5.2bn rescue plan	'Shadow of its former self'	"Sears, the long-troubled US department store chain, is set to stagger on.Billionaire Eddie Lampert, a hedge fund financier who is chairman of Sears and its former chief executive, has won a bankruptcy court auction to purchase the company for $5.2bn (£4bn).Assuming it is approved, his plan will keep more than 400 stores open and preserve up to 45,000 jobs.However some creditors have objected, criticising Mr Lampert's leadership and lack of turnaround plan.They said allowing Mr Lampert to maintain control of the company - which also owns Kmart - would deprive them of the chance to recover money owed to them.Mr Lampert's team has ""failed to set forth a business plan that offers any viable go-forward path. Sears simply cannot survive as a going concern,"" attorneys for those creditors wrote.A bankruptcy judge must approve the deal for it to move forward. That hearing is scheduled for 1 February, Sears said.Sears, which traces its roots to a mail-order catalogue started in the 1880s, is the latest in a string of retailers who have faced financial struggles, as shoppers make more purchases online.Once a fixture in shopping malls around the US, the firm had about 690 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in October - down from 1,700 at the end of 2014.The restructuring committee for Sears said the deal with Mr Lampert was the best hope to keep the firm alive.""Importantly, the consummation of the transaction would preserve employment for tens of thousands of associates, as well as the relationships with many vendors and suppliers who provide Sears with goods and services,"" it said.However, critics blame some of Sears' problems on Mr Lampert, who has served simultaneously as landlord, creditor, investor and manager.On Thursday, the creditors objecting to his bid said Mr Lampert was ""hopelessly conflicted"".They said he has used the firm's financial stress for his own benefit, for example by offering loans and selling valuable property to a company affiliated with his hedge fund, ESL Investments.They said: ""ESL's current bid to ""save the Company"" is nothing but the final fulfilment of a years-long scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's and ESL's own pockets.""ESL Investments said in a statement it would ""vigorously contest"" any effort to pursue claims against it or Mr Lampert."
business	Clintons in survival talks over shop closures and rent cuts	Potential sale	"Greetings card chain Clintons is considering shop closures and rent cuts as part of a survival plan.The retailer, which has about 2,500 staff, is in restructuring talks with landlords in another sign of the High Street crisis.A spokeswoman told the BBC no decisions have yet been made.Clintons was responding to reports on Sunday that it wanted to close 66 out of 332 shops, with landlords slashing rents on most of the other stores.The restructuring would involve a controversial scheme known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows companies to continue trading while pushing through closures and rent cuts.A Clintons spokeswoman said ""discussions are continuing with our landlords but no decisions have been made"".But she declined to comment on a Sunday Telegraph report that the company told landlords 90 of its shops were loss-making and that sales were expected to continue to decline.One landlord told the BBC that although there was a meeting with Clintons last week, very few details of the restructuring plan were given. More talks are expected this week.The Sunday Times said landlords would have until 20 December to air their objections to a CVA. However, landlords have taken an increasingly tough stance on the growing use of CVAs and are more prepared to fight demands for rent cuts.The retailer, formed in 1968, is owned by the Weiss family, which previously controlled the American Greetings retail chain in the US.Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, had appointed advisers from consultancy KPMG to explore a potential sale, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received.News of Clintons' restructuring comes days after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk.Mothercare is part of a long list of High Street names to go under, including Maplin and Poundworld. Others, including Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright, have been forced into restructuring.A string of restaurant chains have also closed amid a squeeze on consumer spending.Retail experts expect more pain, however, as firms approach the make-or-break Christmas trading period. It is common for banks to wait until they have a clearer picture of Christmas and New Year sales before pulling the plug on retailers."
business	High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost		"The government is facing calls to overhaul its High Street policies after estimates were made of 85,000 retail sector job losses on a year ago.The British Retail Consortium made the calculation after finding that the number of retail employees in the third quarter fell by 2.8% on a year earlier.This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline, the BRC said.Helen Dickinson, BRC boss, said it was time to overhaul business rates and the apprenticeship levy.""Weak consumer demand and Brexit uncertainty continue to put pressure on retailers already focused on delivering the transformation taking place in the industry.""While MPs rail against job losses in manufacturing, their response to larger losses in retail has remained muted,"" she said.She said reforms to business rates and the apprenticeship levy would allow retailers to focus on enhancing their online presence and adapt to changes on the High Street.The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""The government should enact policies that enable retailers to invest more in the millions of people who choose to build their careers in retail,"" Ms Dickinson said.The figures are released at time when shops are closing on the High Street with clothing retailer Karen Millen and Coast among the recent outlets to shut.In July the proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015, according to a BRC and Springboard survey.The BRC used data from the Office for National Statistics to calculate that a 2.8% fall in jobs in the third quarter was the equivalent of 85,000 jobs being lost in a year.The largest impact was on full-time jobs with a 4.5% fall year-on-year and a 1.5% fall in part-time roles.The figures were released ahead of the all-important Christmas season and while the BRC said the retailers it surveyed were not planning on cutting more jobs - unlike a year ago - it was only a temporary seasonal pick-up.""We expect the long-term decline in employment to continue due to a combined effect of the on-going structural change, weak consumer spending and fierce competition in the industry,"" the BRC said.It said 62% of retailers had plans to increase staff in the coming quarter, higher than the 43% last year.The lobby group contrasted the state of the job market in the retail sector with the broader economy where it said ONS data showed employment increased 0.3% on the year."
business	Sainsbury's sees retail sales fall 1.1% over Christmas	'Tough market'Analysis by Today business presenter Dominic O'Connell'Mixed bag''Hugely disruptive'	"Sainsbury's has seen sales fall over Christmas after non-food trading was hit by consumer caution.Like-for-like retail sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell by 1.1% across the Christmas period.General merchandise sales, including at Sainsbury's-owned Argos, fell by 2.3% and overall clothing sales by 0.2%.Chief executive Mike Coupe said: ""Retail markets are highly competitive and very promotional and the consumer outlook continues to be uncertain.""He added: ""General merchandise sales grew strongly over the key Christmas weeks and outperformed the market over the quarter.""Sales declined in the quarter due to cautious customer spending and our decision to reduce promotional activity across Black Friday. Clothing performed well, with strong full-price sales growth in a tough market.""He said shoppers also cut back on their spending on food over Christmas, with slower sales growth for the premium Taste the Difference range.However, the supermarket giant said in the 15 weeks to 9 January, grocery sales grew by 0.4%, with groceries online and in convenience stores up by 6% and 3%.Sainsbury's shares were ahead by 2.18% in midday trading in London.Pundits had expected Sainsbury's to have the weakest Christmas numbers of the big four grocery chains.They were right - but for the wrong reasons. Sainsbury's core grocery business did quite well given the fierce competition from the mainstream rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, and the extra squeeze from the German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl.The weakness came in so-called general merchandise, which includes Argos, which Sainsbury's bought two years ago.The problem, Sainsbury's said, was not Christmas trading, but Black Friday.It chose not to follow rivals' fierce discounting and sales suffered accordingly.While this explanation is undoubtedly correct, it will not impress investors, who will point out that Argos was meant to provide diversification away from the super-competitive grocery market, and that complaining about discounting on Black Friday is like complaining about cold weather in January.All this week's trading updates show only sales. We will not know the real winners - which retailers turned those sales into profits - until later in the year, in Sainsbury's case in the full-year results in May.The third-quarter retail sales figure was worse than analysts had expected, having predicted a 0.2% decline.Retail analyst Teresa Wickham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a mixed bag. Christmas has clearly been difficult for them.""She said Sainsbury's had had to make difficult decisions about how far it should go down the promotional route in order to compete with Aldi and Lidl.But she added that the UK's second-largest grocery chain had a ""very valuable property in Argos"", despite the fall in merchandise sales.And Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics said: ""These results aren't disastrous but demonstrate the significant challenges faced by the big grocers.""Sainsbury's plans to merge with rival Asda, with a verdict on the plan due from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in February.Mr Coupe denied that the emphasis on the merger meant Sainsbury's management had lost direction. He said there were about 20 people dealing with the merger, but more than 100,000 members of staff focused on Sainsbury's customers.He said the firm continued to have constructive talks with the CMA and was confident a merger would ""bring lower prices for consumers"".Meanwhile, Sainsbury's, like other UK supermarkets, is preparing for the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal.Mr Coupe said a no-deal Brexit would be very challenging for retailers, given that UK retailers bring in more than 30% of their volumes from continental Europe.""There is only so much contingency planning you can do,"" he said. ""We have 20 distribution centres and each one can hold about a week's worth of food. But it is not as if there are another 20 distribution centres out there.""How have other retailers fared over Christmas?Mr Coupe said a lot of the stock that the firm brought in from mainland Europe was fresh fruit and vegetables, which could only be held for short periods of times and not be stockpiled.""It would be hugely disruptive if there was a no-deal Brexit, and we would have to manage that on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis,"" he added.""We don't have the capacity to manage more than one week's worth of stock."""
business	Black Friday 'could break buying record'		"This year's Black Friday sale could break buying records in the UK, early figures suggest.At 10:00 GMT, Barclaycard said transaction volumes were up 12.5% from last year, and between 13:00 and 14:00 they were 9% higher.""The fact that records are continuing to be broken suggests that appetite for Black Friday sales is not abating,"" said Rob Cameron from Barclaycard.John Lewis said buyers were snapping up Apple iPads and Lego Star Wars toys.The department store also reported interest in cut-price aftershave and underwear, as shoppers seek bargains for gifts.However, some of the most popular gifts are not being discounted, according to Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at Money.co.uk.""Consumers hoping to snap up one of this year's most popular gadgets today could be disappointed as our research found there are very few Black Friday deals to be had on the most sought-after products,"" he said.""It begs the question, are stores discounting the products that shoppers really want, or slashing prices on the gear they have been unable to shift throughout the year?The website's research found discounts on products such as the Nintendo Switch gaming console and GoPro digital cameras were hard to come by at big retailers.The shopping spree has also suffered a backlash from campaigners concerned that it encourages wasteful impulse buying.Earlier this week, consumer group Which? warned that few real deals were available, with most goods cheaper or available for the same price at other times.It found that just four of 83 products they studied last year were cheaper during the Black Friday promotion."
business	Christmas on the High Street: Retail winners and losers	WinnersMorrisons and TescoAldi and LidlSelfridgesLosersDebenhams and Marks & SpencerMothercareSainsbury'sHalfordsHMVWhat to look out for in 2019	"Many of the UK's largest shopping chains have reported Christmas sales and it's a very mixed picture.While the trade body for shops, the British Retail Consortium, said it's been the worst Christmas for retailers in 10 years, some shops have had a relatively good festive period.""Retail is facing the most disruption it's ever faced,"" says Alan O'Neill, who was hired at Selfridges as a consultant when it was bought by the Weston family in 2003.So whose tills overflowed with Christmas cheer and whose takings resembled an empty stocking?The sales figures in the graphic above cover different reporting periods as the companies follow no convention on what constitutes the Christmas season.Contrary to the usual theme of mid-market stores being squeezed, Tesco and Morrisons both posted increases in sales. Both were helped out by sales outside their superstores.Morrisons said sales rose 3.6% in the nine weeks to 6 January. A 3% rise in the wholesale division, which supplies Amazon and McColls, assisted its growth. In the stores, sales rose 0.6%Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, beat forecasts with a 2.2% rise in comparable sales for the six weeks to 5 January. That beat City estimates of up to 1.5%.""It looks like Christmas delivered the goods for Tesco,"" says Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Of course, the coast isn't totally clear - Aldi and Lidl are moving in on market share.""However, Tesco and Morrisons may merely have ""bounced back"" from the ground lost last year, which was particularly hard on the superstores, warns retail consultant Clare Bailey.German discount supermarket chain Aldi said it made almost £1bn in sales during December in its best-ever Christmas trading, with sales 10% higher than the previous year. Lidl sales jumped 8%.According to data from market researchers Kantar, Aldi and Lidl had a combined market share of 12.7% over the 12-week festive period, their highest-ever for Christmas.Two-thirds of all households shopped at either Aldi or Lidl over that time, Kantar said.Selfridges reported sales up 8% in the first 24 days of December.The department store said it helped draw customers through various entertainments including a Christmas cabaret, confetti cannons, visits from Father Christmas and choirs. A five-year £300m refit of its flagship London store is also under way.The two department stores, with more than 300 years of history between them, had a tough Christmas. Debenhams, which is shutting 50 stores, said sales in the six weeks to 5 Jan dropped 3.4%. Customers were in a bargain-hunting mood, it said. Over the longer 18-week trading period, sales fell 5.7%.Mild weather and promotions were blamed by Marks & Spencer for a sales drop of 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell 2.1% and its clothing and home sales division slid 2.4%.""Their proposition is just no longer relevant to their audience,"" says Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, and author of two reviews of the High Street. ""For Marks & Spencer, Next is doing a better job and in Debenhams' case the 1980s aren't here today.""Discounting products ""isn't working"" for either store, he adds.Mothercare blamed a ""difficult consumer backdrop"" for a fall in sales in the UK in its last quarter. Sales fell 11.4% and online sales dropped more, by 16.3%, the firm said on Wednesday. It has discounted less of its stock this year, it added.The business is closing 36 stores and by the end of March, there will be 79 stores, down from 137 in May 2018.Sainsbury's has seen sales fall over Christmas after non-food trading was hit.Sales, excluding takings from stores open less than a year, fell by 1.1% across the Christmas period.General merchandise sales, including at Sainsbury's-owned Argos, fell by 2.3% and overall clothing sales by 0.2%.There was speculation that Argos could have benefited from the demise of Toys R Us, which collapsed last year. But this boost didn't materialise, says retail consultant Clare Bailey, which could be down to changing trends in toy buying, including demand for tech-based presents.Halfords issued a profit warning after sales at established stores fell 1.7% for the 14 weeks to 4 January.The car and bike parts shop blamed mild winter weather in November and December, as motoring-related sales led the decline, dropping 3.4%.It is perhaps a glib move to include the music retailer, but HMV was among the more severe losers after calling in administrators for the second time in six years, involving 2,200 staff at 125 stores.Owners Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges.Shops doing poorly are probably led by complacent management who ""don't take the risks they need to take"", says Alan O'Neill, the former Selfridges consultant.His advice for them is to cut excess shopping space, negotiate with landlords, expand online rather than admitting defeat to online-only stores like Asos, and to stop discounting as a promotional tool. Instead, make use of January sales to shift old stock.Shops doing well are taking risks with clever campaigns and spending money on high-quality stores, products and service.Cutting costs from staff to product quality is also hurting retail sales and ultimately profit, says retail industry consultant Richard Hyman.""It's not difficult to cut costs in a business,"" he said, but it is hard to do it without shrinking sales.Regular business-watchers will have noted that these updates are for sales only - no mention of profit. And that they are published very quickly after the event.""The fact that these numbers are unaudited and unregulated, and so much store is set by them, is a disconnect,"" says Mr Hyman. ""We need these numbers to be regulated and to be audited.""The real proof of the pudding will be in April,"" he told the BBC, when audited results will be available, and, crucially, profit numbers, which will show what effect discounts will have had."
business	US retail giant Sears may get reprieve from liquidation	Sears became irrelevantThe rise and fall of Sears	"Sears, the US department store chain that once dominated US shopping malls, may be getting a reprieve.The firm had been expected to ask a bankruptcy judge for permission to liquidate after failing to reach a deal with chairman Edward Lampert over a $4.4bn (£3.5bn) takeover.But after last minute negotiations, the firm said on Tuesday it would consider a revised offer from Mr Lampert, which would keep about 425 stores open.The court must still approve the deal.Sears did not disclose details of Mr Lampert's new bid, which it will decide whether or not to accept at an auction planned for 14 January.To proceed, Mr Lampert must submit a deposit of about $120m tomorrow.Sears Holdings - which also owns Kmart - first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October, seeking court protection to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business.The 126-year-old firm had almost 690 stores and 68,000 employees when it filed for bankruptcy.Should liquidation go ahead, many of those would lose their jobs.However, retail analysts say some parts of the business could be salvaged from any liquidation, such as its home services unit.In a tweet on Monday, the firm's social media team said: ""We may be slowing down, but we are not out of the race just yet. Don't count us completely out. Happy Shopping!""Sears traces its origins to a firm founded by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck in 1886 as a mail order catalogue company.It opened its first retail locations in 1925 and eventually became a fixture in shopping malls across the US.It was America's largest retailer by revenue until 1989, when Walmart overtook it,In recent years, the company has suffered, along with many other traditional retailers, from rising online competition from firms such as Amazon.Mr Lampert is the company's former chief executive, its landlord, and biggest investor and creditor. His hedge fund, ESL Investments, took a stake in Sears in 2004, later combining it with Kmart.Critics say the firm, under his leadership, failed to invest in its stores, while taking on rising debt.Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said: ""Reports of Sears headed to liquidation suggest that the much-storied retailer is now at the end of its long road to collapse.""Its recent journey to this point has been characterised by incredibly poor strategic decisions, chronic underinvestment and continuous financial machinations designed to keep the company afloat.""All of this impacted trading, which has remained dire, making Sears more like a patient in a coma than a fully functioning retailer.""By Samira Hussain, BBC New York business correspondent:Many stores have come and gone but the demise of a former titan like Sears, signals the end of an era in retail.When my family needed a new appliance, we would head to Sears. I remember running through the huge store with my brother as my parents looked at new refrigerators or washing machines or vacuum cleaners.When I got older, I would head to Sears to buy presents from my mum. (The toaster went down badly but the bottle of Chanel No 5 was a hit).But ask me now when was the last time I walked into a Sears store, and I really couldn't say. Part of the problem is the storied retailer did not keep up with the competition - and not just online competitors such as Amazon, but even bricks and mortar stores such as Walmart and Target.After 126 years, it's sad to see the once-mighty Sears become irrelevant.

business	How Instagram influencers would tackle the retail crisis	1. 'Think carefully about what makes you different'2. Respond to trends quicker3. Use social media to market your brand4. The High Street has unique advantages	"We all know that it's been a tough year for fashion retailers on the High Street, but online it's been quite a different story.Internet-based ""fast-fashion"" retailers such as Boohoo, In The Style and Missguided have - by and large - been growing at a clip as they target younger consumers seeking the latest trends at rock-bottom prices.Key to their success has been the social media platform Instagram, which millennial consumers increasingly use to find fashion inspiration and which retailers view as a vital marketing tool.It's left traditional bricks-and-mortar operators struggling to seem relevant.But top Instagram influencers, who get paid to promote fashion online, told us it didn't have to be that way and that High Street players could still thrive with the right strategy.So what do they think could be done to help our struggling retailers?Content is not availableJasmine Jonas, a British influencer with more than 20,000 followers on Instagram, rarely shops on the High Street anymore which she thinks is ""sad"".""The biggest thing the High Street is up against is convenience,"" she says. ""There's a lot more discounting online too.""She gives the example of fast-fashion site Nasty Gal (owned by Boohoo), which was recently offering 50% off everything on its website via a discount code.""You could be in a store that sells exactly the same thing, but if you can get it online half price and delivered to your door the next day then it's obvious who you're going to choose.""To compete she thinks High Street retailers need to offer new incentives to get people into their stores. That could mean extending their opening hours more than just once a week to accommodate our busy lives, or making visits to their shops more of an experience.""When I was growing up, going to the shops was an experience in itself but it seems that essence has died,"" Ms Jonas says.""So High Street retailers need to think carefully about what they can do to be different. They could hold events in store like Topshop, which sometimes has a DJ or a prosecco bar. And there is loads of stuff where bloggers will do their top picks or give talks about fashion.""Birthday Behavior 👑 Coming Soon! 💖⠀ When's your birthday?⠀ Search: ""Birthday Bash Sequin Romper""⠀ Search: ""Twenty Fun Satin Dress""⠀ Search: ""Cut To The Chase Mini Dress"" Search: “Those Are Fire Heeled Sandals” ✨www.FashionNova.com✨A post shared by FashionNova.com (@fashionnova) on Aug 10, 2018 at 5:17pm PDTEnd of Instagram post by fashionnovaFast-fashion businesses are also better at reacting to new trends than traditional retailers, and keep a close eye on social media so they can replicate styles that go viral - sometimes in a matter of days.A recent example was when Kylie Jenner, the American reality television and social media star, had a birthday party and wore several different dresses, photos of which were widely shared online.A week later, online retailer Fashion Nova was already selling dresses that appeared to be directly inspired by Ms Jenner's outfits (see above).""How fast you can respond is extremely important,"" says Emily Johnston, a London-based Instagram influencer with 69,000 followers.She thinks all retailers should monitor Instagram which is ""a window into the fashion world"" and allows people to interact with brands and trends in real time.""This is the first time in history that market research is being done for free, right in front of retailers' eyes. Maybe some of these struggling businesses are not paying attention.""The relative cheapness of fast-fashion goes hand in hand with Instagram culture, as users often buy goods online that they will only wear a few times, just so they can look good on the site.And perhaps not surprisingly, Instagram has become a powerful direct marketing tool for the best-known fast-fashion sites.Typically they will team up with Instagram influencers who are willing to promote their clothes to their many thousands of followers in exchange for a commission. Some influencers even include links next to garments in their pictures so followers can buy goods they like with a simple swipe.Melissa Holdbrook-Akposoe, who has 78,000 followers on Instagram, says there is a ""huge connection"" between the social media site and the growth of businesses such as Boohoo and Asos.But she thinks older High Street retailers haven't woken up to that fact.""[Fashion retail] is 100% down to marketing and the best at marketing wins in this game,"" she says.Party season is upon us ✨A post shared by Melissa’s Wardrobe (@melissaswardrobe) on Nov 11, 2018 at 10:28am PSTEnd of Instagram post by melissaswardrobeAll of the influencers I spoke to think High Street shops have key advantages over online rivals that they need to exploit.One example, Ms Holdbrook-Akposoe says, is the ability to provide expert customer service. ""When you are in store, you are looking for top quality customer service, information about styles and fabrics. Online you are doing everything by yourself.""She also think that buying masses of cheap clothes online that you will only wear a few times is unsustainable - both financially and terms of the environment. And while online players may win on price, the craftsmanship on the High Street is usually better.Ms Johnston agrees, pointing out that consumers are also becoming sceptical about the steep discounts offered by some online retailers.""The question is whether they are genuine offers or just marketing. The retailers have trained us to shop for sales.""Ms Jonas says she misses the buzz of shopping on the High Street, something that online players will never be able to replicate.""I think there is still a joy to be had in going to a shop and seeing the clothes in person. And there are so many times when I have bought online and none of the items were right. You then have to wait for the money to be refunded before you can buy something else and it's a waste of time."""
business	Angling Direct: The company bucking the retail slump	Personal touchWho are Angling Direct?	"Angling Direct has bucked the recent trend of poor figures from retailers by revealing bumper sales over the four months to November.The fishing equipment retailer's sales rose by 31.5% to £14.6m in the period, helped by a record Black Friday week when sales jumped 56% to £1.3m.The Norfolk-based firm's international sales arose by 98% in November, helped by its new German language website.Earlier in December, rivals Fishing Republic went into administration.The figures from Angling Direct are a ray of light in the retail industry after a disappointing year. Surveys have suggested that the number of people out shopping in the UK in November fell to its lowest level since the 2008 recession and, last weekend, retail experts Springboard estimated shopping numbers were 9% lower on Saturday than the same time a year earlier.There are also signs that the sector's problems have spread beyond the High Street. On Monday, online retail giant Asos sent shockwaves through the retail sector after it warned sales and profits were set to be lower than expected.So why has Angling Direct been so successful in the current climate?Chief executive Darren Bailey puts it down to the personal touch.He told the BBC: ""I believe this year has been particularly strong due to long-term relationships we build with our customers through our service offering, our loyalty scheme and the overall advice given to them.""The Black Friday deal was simply one extra benefit to use Angling Direct. This year followed a very similar structure from the past couple of years.""We aim to provide advice, recommendations and support both online and in store to ensure our customers enjoy their fishing.Angling Direct's in-store like-for-like turnover increased by 7.2% to £4.96m and its online sales jumped by 24% in the four-months to November.Mr Bailey said the retailer planned to grow its online business and open new stores.""The aim is to open 10 new branches in 2019 and another 10 in 2020. Online we are rolling out multiple European websites to make our current offering more accessible to the continent.""Shares in Angling Direct were up nearly 2% on Tuesday afternoon, giving the company a market value of £54m and putting it in range of some better-known retailers. Department store chain Debenhams has a market capitalisation of about £57m."
business	Shops in a box: The rise of shipping container retail parks		"More than a dozen food, retail or office complexes made from shipping containers have opened across Britain within the past three years.The figures, from research by Radio 4's You and Yours programme, demonstrate the growing popularity of so-called container communities.Organisers say they provide a stepping stone for small businesses before they move to bigger premises.Some of the sites offer city centre locations but are only temporary.Rents for space inside converted containers are relatively cheap and sites have opened in cities including Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh and York with others planned for Liverpool and Norwich.Newcastle upon Tyne's shipping container complex, called Stack Newcastle, opened in 2018. It is made from more than 50 converted shipping containers, and operators said it received 50,000 visitors a week on average within six months of opening.It was installed in the city centre on a derelict site that used to be home to an Odeon cinema.Now the land is occupied by dozens of small, independent businesses that are trading from converted shipping containers.""We've really enjoyed the opportunity to be able to trade in the middle of the city,"" said Andy Barton, who sells freshly-made pizza from a unit in the centre of the complex.He said it would normally be ""too expensive"" for his start-up business to be based at such a prime location.The complex is temporary and only has permission from Newcastle City Council to be there for three years.In 2021, the site is due to be cleared for redevelopment.Mr Barton said he hoped to have developed his business by then so it could successfully move to another location in the city centre.Other container communities offering low rent and more flexible leases have helped small businesses to branch out into bricks and mortar premises.James Leay, from Make Shift, a company behind the Pop Brixton container community in London, said more than 25 of its tenants had moved to alternative locations since it opened on a former car parking site in 2015.""It is relatively easy to start your business from a bedroom or to test an idea on a market stall but that next step is a 15-year commercial lease and that comes with big premiums,"" he said.""We answer the space gap. We take people on that journey from a market stall and take them three years later into a bricks and mortar space.""In 2011, Boxpark at Shoreditch in London was the first food and retail park made of refitted shipping containers to open in the UK.How many others have followed its lead is hard to say as there is no central register, but after going through newspaper cuttings and councils' planning records, You and Yours found at least 13 container complexes were launched in British towns and cities during the three years from 2016 to the end of 2018.Aside from Stack Newcastle they include:Some are temporary, others are not. The list is not exhaustive so it is likely that other container communities opened during that period.For temporary projects on plots of land that are due to be returned to their owners, the challenge can be making enough money to cover set-up costs.A total of £1.9m was spent installing Pop Brixton on land owned by Lambeth Council.Even though its operators say it makes an annual profit of around £400,000 a year, they acknowledge that it would have made a loss if its lease had not been extended from three to five years.It is now due to close in 2020.""I think Pop was a real experiment,"" said Mr Leay. ""I think what you are seeing from local authorities now is understanding that these things really need five or 10 years not two or three years.""In Newcastle upon Tyne, some existing businesses backed plans for its shipping container park but others objected to it, and there are worries that it is competing with, rather than complementing, existing retailers.Stack Newcastle's operations director, Kevin Walker, maintains it is bringing people into the city and puts its success down to the events that it hosts, such as live music, pet and fashion shows, as well as its mix of independent shops, bars and food outlets.""We have been inundated with different councils looking to do similar schemes on land that would normally just be standing empty,"" he said.""I do think it has got legs probably for 10 years if I am honest and then I think something else will come along. Let's just enjoy the next 10 years, popping these things in wherever we can.""You can hear more on this story on You & Yours, BBC Radio 4 from 12:15pm on Wednesday 30 January"
business	UK retail sales hit by mild autumn	Are spending patterns changing?What does it mean for retailers?Did the retail figures hit the pound?What else is happening in the UK economy?	"Retail sales fell by a worse-than-expected 0.5% in October, after a mild autumn hit sales of winter clothes.Sales at household goods stores also fell 3% following a particularly strong August and September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.For the three months to October, retail sales rose 0.4% - a considerable slowdown from the 2.3% increase recorded for the three months to July.Analysts said October's fall suggested shoppers were cutting back spending.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop was the ""first real sign that consumers are tightening their purse strings due to uncertainty about Brexit"".Non-food sales fell 1.3%, with a 1% decline in clothing sales, which he said could not be blamed on the weather.""Consumers' confidence already has weakened in recent months due to concerns about the economic outlook and we doubt households are feeling any surer that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided after this week's political turbulence,"" Mr Tombs said.""Unless the government miraculously manages to force the current withdrawal agreement through parliament soon, growth in consumers' spending will weaken markedly in the fourth quarter.""Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics said some of October's weakness may reflect consumers delaying spending ahead of ""Black Friday"" discounting this month.""High oil prices also weighed on the volume of fuel sold. As such, we suspect that there could be a rebound in sales volumes in November as oil prices have fallen sharply and if Black Friday sales pick up,"" he added.The Christmas quarter accounts for a big proportion of profits for most retailers and is set to be very tough.Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said more than half of consumers do their Christmas shopping in November or earlier.""Given consumers' appetite to rein in their spending, the promotions on and around Black Friday will likely be more of a draw than ever,"" he said.""We expect this year's Black Friday to generate record levels of UK spending, which will likely boost November's retail figures overall. Whether it will be enough to make this a 'golden' quarter remains to be seen.""It is difficult to say with any certainty, as sterling had already started sliding on Thursday morning following the resignation of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab over Theresa May's draft Brexit deal before the retail sales figures were released.The pound fell as low as $1.2751 following the departure of Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, before recovering some ground to trade at about $1.28 and €1.1318 - both falls of 1.5%.Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, said: ""All eyes are now on Theresa May with a challenge to her leadership increasingly being viewed as the next catalyst for another sterling collapse.""Earlier this week the ONS said inflation was steady at 2.4% last month, despite expectations of a modest rise.Prices of food and clothing fell, but utility bills and petrol prices were up, said the ONS.Separate ONS figures suggested that the squeeze on consumers' wallets is easing slightly, as wage growth outstrips inflation.In the three months to September, wages excluding bonuses rose by 3.2% compared with a year earlier - the biggest rise since the end of 2008."
business	UK retail sales in November jump more than expected	Analysis:By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent	"Retail sales jumped more than expected in November, helped by Black Friday promotions and stronger growth in sales of household goods.Official figures showed sales rose 1.4% from October, despite economists' forecasts of about a 0.3% gain.But for the three months to November, which smoothes out monthly volatility, sales growth was 0.4% on the previous quarter, the slowest rate since April.Several retailers have warned of tough trading this winter.Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said November was ""unbelievably bad"", while Superdry and online retailer Asos have also warned of dismal trading.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the changing nature of Black Friday sales promotions posed a challenge for the process of adjusting for seasonal variations.Household goods sales leapt by 5.3% on the month in November, the biggest increase since the end of 2013 and driven by an 11% increase in electrical appliances. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing exceeded 20% for the first time, the ONS said.Surveys from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard have suggested that households were continuing to shop cautiously in November.However, recently consumers have seen the fastest growth in underlying pay growth since 2008, with inflation falling to a 20-month low of 2.3%, according to ONS figures released earlier this week.Thomas Pugh, UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the stronger spending could point to a weaker December, but that the longer term trend was more positive.He said: ""With inflation continuing to fall back... and pay growth on the up, there should be scope for consumer spending growth to gather some momentum further ahead. [The] big picture is that a continued acceleration in real earnings, assuming a Brexit deal is signed, should give household spending a boost next year.""Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said November data showed that ""online is now truly coming of age"".He added: ""More than perhaps any month before, the fact that overall sales rose in November was thanks to the relative success of Black Friday online compared with on the High Street.""The most recent high street and shopping centre footfall data for November, compiled by Springboard, showed the worst decline since the recession.It turns out Christmas came early - but may not have been quite the bumper gift that some retailers were anticipating. Black Friday is increasingly a fixture in the festive shopping calendar, shifting Christmas spending from December to November.The ONS, which produces the retail figures, smooth them out to allow for seasonal patterns, but their adjustment process may not have yet caught up with what is still quite a new phenomenon.So, the ""adjusted"" increase in the amount of goods sold between October and November may appear stronger than it should. And it's clear that shifting more goods in November came at a heavy price for retailers such as Asos, which had to discount heavily to keep up with competitors, damaging profits.Beyond the November headline, the underlying trend in spending is slowing - growing by 0.4% over the last four months. That's the weakest rate since April, and doesn't bode well for retailers or the economy as a whole.And if Christmas shopping is happening earlier, December could disappoint. Indeed, a survey from CBI points to weakest growth in sales this month for over a year."
business	Amazon and eBay 'listing unsafe toys for sale'		"Amazon and eBay have failed to stop toys from being listed for sale which appear to have been declared unsafe by the EU, according to Which?The consumer group is asking the next government to make online marketplaces legally responsible for stopping dangerous products from being listed.Which? found products for sale which it believed posed a risk to children.EBay removed 12 flagged products, while Amazon took down the five listed for sale.Which? looked at toys which had been registered as dangerous by the EU's safety gate system since 2017.The scheme flags products which have been recalled, withdrawn from sale or stopped at the border over safety worries.The toys on eBay included toy slime, a Transformers helmet and a cartoon helicopter, all of which seemed to be very similar to dangerous products.The Amazon listings included a magnetic building set, an inflatable swim ring and a remote controlled car.The safety risk in the toys across both sites included high levels of chemicals in some toys, too much lead in others and the risk of intestinal blockage from parts in others.Earlier in the year, the British Toy and Hobby Association raised similar concerns - warning that one in five toys it found sold on Amazon and eBay were dangerous for children.Which? tested out Amazon Marketplace itself by listing for sale a squishy toy, which had been recalled in October 2018 because it posed a risk of choking or suffocation.The toy remained on Amazon for two weeks before Which? withdrew the listing itself.It also put on the site a soft fabric car seat, which are illegal in the UK.Online marketplaces are not currently responsible for making sure that the products sold on their sites are safe.Caroline Normand, Which? director of advocacy, said: ""It's clear that consumer protections have not kept pace with the changes to the retail industry, and it is not acceptable for marketplaces to pass the buck for the responsibility of the items sold on their sites by simply pointing the finger at sellers.""The next government must make marketplaces legally responsible for preventing unsafe products from being sold on their sites, establish clearer requirements for taking down dangerous products and ensure better enforcement is in place to keep consumers safe.""EBay told Which?: ""Sellers aren't permitted to list dangerous products on eBay, or items that have been recalled. The listings flagged have been removed and we have requested that sellers contact customers with a safety notice and their refunds policy.""And an eBay spokesperson told the BBC: ""Consumer safety is our number one priority and we invest significantly in keeping our marketplace safe and educating users on product safety.""Between October 2018 and October 2019 our filters automatically blocked five million listings from entering the marketplace on product safety grounds.""While eBay goes beyond the legal requirements for safety, we are constantly working to improve the systems and policies already in place on our site and welcome further clarification on guidelines so we can continue to play our part in ensuring consumer safety.""Amazon said: ""All sellers must follow our selling guidelines, and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available.""It also said its first objective is to block suspicious, unsafe, or non-compliant products from being listed.It told Which? that it uses proprietary technology to screen partners and block suspicious businesses, as well as to check product listings, and has teams of compliance experts who conduct manual checks."
business	Christmas adverts - do they really work?	Competition rising	"""I think Christmas ads are pretty good. They're not too commercial and they cheer you up,"" says 19-year-old Johan Stone.It seems to be a common view on a busy London shopping street, where I struggle to find anyone who dislikes them.We're only a few weeks into November and the Christmas advertising campaign season is well under way, with big budget ads from John Lewis, Sainsbury's, Ikea and Amazon already gracing our screens and social media.The lavish productions rack up millions of hits on sites such as YouTube.They may be popular, but people are less sure about whether these ads actually benefit the big brands behind them.""I enjoy them but they don't make me rush out to buy stuff,"" says Jeanette Sewell, who is retired. ""I already know where I'm going to do my Christmas shopping and what I'm going to buy.""At a time when many consumers are reining in their spending, this sort of reaction has raised alarm bells in some quarters.Festive campaigns typically cost in the millions, with most of that money being spent on buying advertising space. Last year, John Lewis was said to have spent about £8m on its ad featuring Elton John playing his hit Your Song.It led Apprentice star and business mogul Lord Sugar to call the campaign a waste of money that would have ""no impact on sales"".It is true the ad came at the end of a particularly difficult year for John Lewis. But the retailer says the campaign was an unmitigated success, attracting 50 million views across social media.""Our ads always deliver an excellent return on investment at a time of year that is critical for us, generally delivering 20 times the return on our original spend,"" a spokeswoman tells the BBC.Market research company Kantar also believes that Christmas ads benefit retailers.It says UK consumers spend about £30bn in the so-called ""golden quarter"" leading up to Christmas, and competition to attract their attention is fierce.A great Christmas ad will help them cut through this noise and ""sparks conversations"", says chief growth officer, Jane Bloomfield.Consumers also love them, she says, and they create merchandising opportunities. Note the popularity of Aldi's Kevin the carrot toy, which is based on the character in its ads.""The impact also isn't just at Christmas - it will set you up for the year ahead. It is important to remind consumers of your brand at this time of year,"" Ms Bloomfield says.As for the big budgets, she says retailers will typically make back the costs of their Christmas ad in a day during the busy festive period.However, she admits not all ads will hit their intended target.According to Kantar, a good Christmas ad should:Ms Bloomfield says that Amazon's ad this year is well made and a ""real crowd pleaser"", offering something for ""young and old with humour and warmth"".In the ad people give each other gifts packaged in singing Amazon boxes, set to the soundtrack of Solomon Burke's classic soul track ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love"".She is less keen on Asda's offering, though, which features a young girl using her imagination to help Christmas wishes come true by capturing the magic of the Northern Lights.The ad has received positive reviews, with one newspaper calling it ""adorable"". But Kantar and others have complained it is hard to follow and doesn't really reinforce Asda's brand.For some, the trend for lavish Christmas ads feels out of sync with the times. We have seen a host of retailers announce closures over the last few years, as more shopping shifts online. Other big retailers such as M&S - which has two ads out this year - are in the midst of painful restructuring drives.""In recent years retailers' advertising has become like the space race - who can spend more,"" says retail analyst Richard Hyman. ""It doesn't sound like a very sensible way to run retail businesses that are by-and-large struggling.""He doesn't dispute that Christmas is an important time of year for retailers, but says it's hard to justify the sort of ""lavish self-indulgent campaigns"" we typically see.Mr Hyman expects many will rein in spending this year, and indeed some already have.John Lewis is just running one festive ad this year - which features Edgar, an excitable dragon - for both its John Lewis and Waitrose brands.And Debenhams, which had to be rescued from administration by its creditors in May, tells the BBC that its 2019 festive ad was produced in-house ""which has been a huge cost saving for the business"".That said, it seems highly unlikely that brands will pull back from releasing festive ads now the trend is well established. It has become an event for retailers, with the big brands all striving to outdo each other.As Ms Bloomfield sums up: ""There is a sense that if you didn't do one of these ads things would be worse for you. I think there is an element of fear of missing out. That's why brands try to stagger the release of their ads so they can achieve maximum impact."""
business	US retail giant Sears files for bankruptcy	Analysis:'Tarnished' brand	"Sears, the US department store chain that once dominated America's shopping malls, has filed for bankruptcy.Sears Holdings - which also owns Kmart - filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday.The company has suffered, along with many other traditional retailers, from rising online competition from firms such as Amazon.Sears has been closing stores and selling properties as it grapples with debts of more than $5bn.The company employs nearly 90,000 people in the US, although that is down from 246,000 five years ago, and in its heyday it had more than 3,000 stores.It became America's largest retailer before being overtaken by Walmart in the 1980s.The firm filed for bankruptcy petition after it reportedly could not meet a $134m repayment due on Monday.Chapter 11 protection postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business.Eddie Lampert - who is the company's chief executive, biggest investor and landlord - had attempted to restructure its debts to avoid bankruptcy.In a statement, he said: ""Over the last several years, we have worked hard to transform our business and unlock the value of our assets.""While we have made progress, the plan has yet to deliver the results we have desired.""Announcing its bankruptcy filing, Sears also said it would close 142 unprofitable stores by the end of the year, on top of the previously announced closure of 46 stores by November.by Kim Gittleson, New York business correspondentEntering a Sears in 2018 was like travelling back in time - and not in a good way.Chronic underinvestment in the company's physical stores meant that shelves were often empty and signs for products were handwritten.That's assuming you found a reason to walk into a Sears in the first place. By the mid-1990s most of what Sears sold was available elsewhere, often at a discount.Ironically for a company who rose to prominence with its catalogues and its use of the US Postal Service to deliver nearly everything, everywhere (sound familiar?), the modern-day Sears seemed averse to investing significantly in any e-commerce presence.With some of its best-located stores sold off in a push to raise capital, it eventually became even more difficult to find a Sears - Walmart has over 5,000 locations in the US; Target has over 1,800; even Macy's has over 800 stores.While Sears' closure of another 142 locations certainly marks an end of an era in US retailing, the reality is that Americans still love to shop, even in physical stores, if you give them a reason.They just didn't want to shop at Sears.Some analysts say Sears' problems were exacerbated by a lack of investment in stores.Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail said Sears' troubles began in the 1980s when it became ""too diversified and lost the deftness that had once made it the world's largest and most innovative retailer"".""That a storied retailer, once at the pinnacle of the industry, should collapse in such a shabby state of disarray is both terrible and scandalous,"" he said.""The brand is now tarnished just as the economics of its model are firmly stacked against its future success.""Sears was founded by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck in 1886 as a mail order catalogue company. It opened its first retail locations in 1925 and eventually became a fixture in shopping malls across the US.It was America's largest retailer by revenue until 1989, when Walmart overtook it,Mr Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, took a stake in Sears in 2004, later combining it with Kmart with the aim of restoring its profitability.He and his affiliates now own about 49% of Sears.Despite the investment, Sears never regained its footing. It racked up more than $6bn in losses between 2013 and 2017, while annual revenues fell to $16.7bn in 2017, almost half the $31.2bn posted in 2014.As of August, the retailer had more than 860 stores in the US, down from 1,700 at the end of 2014.Sears Canada, which was spun-off from the main company in 2012, filed for bankruptcy last year, with the loss of thousands of jobs."
business	Deadline for UK drone registration approaches		"UK drone pilots must register their details with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the end of 29 November or face a fine of £1,000.Anyone responsible for a drone which weighs more than 250g (8.8oz) must register it with the regulator online.The drone operator must be over 18 and pay a £9 annual fee.The CAA estimates that there are 130,000 drone users in Britain, but so far only around 50,000 people have registered.Anyone of any age can still fly a drone, if they complete a free 20 question multiple choice quiz online and the drone is registered with an adult.In December 2018, drone sightings on the runways at Gatwick Airport caused havoc for thousands of Christmas travellers.The disruption caused about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or diverted over a 36-hour-period.Simon Smith, a pilot instructor at the Phantom Flight School in Maidstone, Kent, told the BBC that the new regulations could help keep the skies safe, but only in conjunction with better technologies.DJI, the largest consumer drone maker in the world, recently demonstrated a new protocol that enables people to use smartphones to identify nearby drones and pinpoint where their pilots are located.""Hand-in-hand with regulations will come technology, as drones are automatically broadcasting details of where they are, who's flying them, where the pilot is located,"" said Mr Smith.""Stuff like that will inevitably improve the situation. We've got to share the air safely and in order to do that, everybody has to got to know where everybody else is.""Apart from facing a hefty fine, people with unregistered drones also potentially face criminal charges if they fly them illegally or negligently, according to the police.The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for the criminal use of drones, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, said: ""We have plans in place to protect the public and we will pursue, investigate and prosecute anyone who uses a drone illegally or in a dangerous way that puts people at risk.""In October, retailer John Lewis said it had stopped selling drones in May amid concerns they were being misused by the general public."
business	High Street: How many UK shops have closed?	1. Shops are empty, and too big2. Shopping habits are changing3. Footfall is declining4. Jobs are being cut5. Tastes are changing	"Hardly a month goes by without news of another wave of shops shutting or of stores losing money.Retailers are holding on to more space than they can pay for, and costs are shooting up, reports suggest. So, what is behind the High Street crisis?Fashion chains Karen Millen and Coast recently announced closures. They had more than 100 outlets and concessions between them.The fast-growing online fashion chain Boohoo snapped up the brands following their collapse. But Boohoo isn't interested in owning and running physical stores and so relaunched them as online-only retailers.The number of empty shops already stands at a record high.In July the proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015.Last year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went bust and vanished altogether.New research also indicates the top 150 UK retailers have 20% more store space than they need and can afford.Some shops such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look have done restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them.In many ways, retail is a pretty simple business. You have to sell things for more than you paid for themBut in the past few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers.Companies have had to deal with rising costs. Researchers at A&M and Retail Economics suggest during the past five years, companies have had to spend 10.8% more on things such as business rates, increasing wages and rents.And, at the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to rapidly changing shopping habits.Consumers now spend one in every five pounds online - and if businesses are seeing 20% fewer sales on the shop floor as well as their fixed costs rising, then profit margins will be squeezed.This huge shift in spending is making businesses think again about how they make money. Too many retailers either fail or are unable to adapt.Those with underlying problems have suffered.Take Debenhams, it's been struggling for years. Its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt and it was tied into long leases.Another department store, House of Fraser, was rescued last year by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. He outlined a plan to create the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and said about 80% of the stores would remain open. But he's now admitted the business was losing more than £1m a week.Consumers are spending increasing amounts of their disposable income on experiences and lifestyle. Being mediocre isn't good enough anymore.Shoppers are making fewer visits to High Streets.The retail analytics company Springboard tracks footfall in main towns and cities. It's seen a decline in numbers for the past few years.Bad weather and a reduced appetite for spending by consumers have played a role along the way.Consumers are still shopping, of course. But even with the rise of online, shops need people to walk through the door.From March 2016 to 2019, UK retail lost 106,000 jobs according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Those figures are based on data from the Office for National Statistics.Poundworld saw the biggest job losses, with more than 5,000 redundancies. Toys R Us and Maplin also lost 5,500 jobs between them.This year, the fallout from various restructurings includes 1,000 job losses and plunging profits at Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group and 100 redundancies at the fashion retailer LK Bennett.More job losses will come. More than two years ago, the BRC warned there would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade.Although the first half of this year saw a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on British High Streets, there were some bright spots.Takeaways, gyms and specialist vaping shops were some categories that saw the largest increases in store openings.Analysts have said this demonstrates the High Street's move away from traditional retailing.Supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are two of the big names also continuing to open lots of stores.But the overall picture is the UK has too many shops, they're too big and in the wrong locations. The winners will be the companies that know what their consumers want and give it to them, with great service and products they want to buy."
business	Tesco: Did 'Drastic Dave' save the UK's biggest retailer?	Grown flabby	"When Dave Lewis moved into the hot seat at Tesco it was very hot indeed.His first act as chief executive was to announce the company had overstated its historical profits by £326m.That led to a fine for the company of £129m and compensation for investors of £85m. He followed that up the following spring by announcing a £6.4bn loss as Tesco got real about the value of its property in an age of growing on-line commerce and a brutal price war against discounters.That is a classic tactic for an incoming CEO to a troubled company. Take the ""big bath"" - clear the decks, place the problems of the past firmly in the hands of your predecessors and move on. There is only one direction you can go after the biggest loss in UK retail history.But there was a lot of work still to do and Dave Lewis is almost universally regarded as having done it extremely well. It was not without pain. ""Drastic Dave"" cut thousands of jobs in order to cut Tesco's costs by £1.5bn in order to compete more effectively with the likes of Aldi and Lidl who were gobbling up market share.Tesco's international businesses were slimmed down - or in the case of its US venture Fresh & Easy - shut down completely. His back to basics approach on food retail was coupled with expanding its on-line grocery business.But perhaps the most important thing he did was to buy the wholesaler Booker for £3.7bn. At a stroke, this gave Tesco a whole new business supplying buyers like hotels, restaurants and corner shops.A few eyebrows were raised when the competition authorities waved the deal through as it created a company worth more at the time than Sainsbury's Morrisons, Marks and Spencer and Ocado put together.It was arguably the approval of that deal that saw Sainsbury's believe they could persuade the same authorities that their merger with Asda could go ahead. They were wrong - and very sore about it.Get in at the bottom - get out at the top. It's a manoeuvre that very few bosses an any walk of life manage to pull off. Not many get to choose the timing or the manner of their leaving.It hasn't been a spotless record. His foray into discounting - the experimental Jack's chain - has not worked. And that most important metric of all for CEOs - the share price - is not much higher than it was when he took over. But this is as much to do with the new harsh realities of the grocery business - Morrisons shares have fared similarly and Sainsbury's much worse.Did Dave Lewis save Tesco? When he arrived, Tesco's brand looked badly damaged, its business had grown flabby and its accounts were being manipulated to flatter its bottom line.He inherited a dominant market position and its market share has fallen from 29% to 27%. That is not much given the rise of the discounters.It's impossible to know whether someone else would have done as good or a better job. But it's fair to say that when he decides what he wants to do next he will not be short of offers."
business	Pound rises through $1.32 on stronger retail sales	Caution ahead	"Stronger-than-expected retail sales helped send the pound through $1.32 as shoppers treated themselves to new furniture and lighting.The Office for National Statistics said sales rose 0.3% between July and August against forecasts for a 0.2% drop.It said growth was strong at both non-food and household goods shops.However, economists warned that spending may slow on higher inflation and caution as the UK enters the final six months before Brexit.Overall, retail sales rose by 3.3% in the year to August according to the ONS, ahead of an expected 2.3% increase.Shortly before 17:00 sterling was up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3238.From July to August household goods' sales jumped 4.5% - the biggest monthly rise since May 2016 - which Samuel Tombs from Pantheon Macroeconomics said ""was powered by a huge 7.8% month-to-month jump in furniture and lighting sales"".However, he cautioned: ""The subdued level of housing market activity suggests that sales in this sector will fall back in September.""Economists also warned that the surprise increase in inflation, which rose to a six month high of 2.7% in August, may dampen spending.The chief executive of Retail Economics, Richard Lim, said: ""Yesterday's surprise rise in inflation means real earnings remain under pressure.""Against a backdrop of heightened political and Brexit uncertainly, many households will be more cautious with their spending.""Despite overall growth in retail, month-on-month clothing sales fell by 1.9%.Ian Gilmartin, from Barclays Corporate Banking, said: ""Clothing dipped in August as most shoppers had already finalised their summer wardrobe and the continued good weather resulted in little appetite for early autumn lines.""With cooler temperatures on the way, fashion retailers will be hoping that they can achieve a better result in the next few weeks.""High Street fashion chain French Connection, which reported its results for the six months to 31 July, said that it expects retail to remain challenging for the rest of its financial year.French Connection's like-for-like sales over the first half tumbled by 7% and its pre-tax loss widened to £15.1m from £5.9m last year.Nevertheless, French Connection's Stephen Marks, the company's founder, chairman, chief executive and the largest shareholder, said its wholesale business was performing well adding: ""We remain on target to return the business to profitability this year."""

business	Warm weather kept shoppers away from Next	Online offsets store slide	"High Street retailer Next has blamed the hot weather for poor sales in August and September.A bellwether for the High Street, Next said sales had improved in October as the temperature fell.In the three months to 26 October, store sales fell 6.7% but a boost in online sales led to an overall 1.6% rise.Its shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index even as analysts said the figures were ""solid"".The shares hit their highest levels in a year earlier this month.The company said the third quarter numbers meant it was on track to meet its guidance of full-price sales up 3.6% and pre-tax profit of £725m.It said sales in July - which rose a better-than-expected 6.8% - ""pulled forward"" sales from August.""Sales in September [up 1%] were adversely affected by unusually warm weather and we saw a significant improvement in October when temperatures fell,"" the retailer said in a trading statement.""We believe the improved sales growth in October recouped some of the lost sales in September and we do not expect sales growth for the rest of the year to be as strong as October,"" the company added.Sales in October were up 5%.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said that overall Next has published ""solid numbers"".""Winter ranges suffered from unseasonably warm and unsettled weather at the start of the quarter, but the trading period was saved as temperatures fell in October which spurred on demand.""While pure in-store sales remained under pressure, online continued to impress with both physical and digital channels working in harmony to deliver growth in a tough market.""But, he said that the market was under pressure and said the news on Tuesday that there would be a general election on 12 December ""couldn't come at a worse time for retailers"".Greg Lawless, at brokers Shore Capital, said the figures showed the ""long-standing trend continued with online sales offsetting the drag from retail stores.But, he added ""bellwether Next has delivered another solid trading update"".For the year to date, Next said stores sales have fallen 4.8% but online is up 11.1% - meaning total sales were up 3.5%."
business	Thomas Cook airport slots bought by EasyJet and Jet2	High demand	EasyJet and Jet2.com have bought all of the take-off and landing slots owned by collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook in UK airports.The slots at London Gatwick and Bristol were bought by EasyJet for £36m, the government's liquidation service said.Jet2.com has bought slots at Manchester, Birmingham and Stansted airports for an undisclosed amount.Thomas Cook's UK business and airline entered insolvency in September, when a court appointed an official receiver.EasyJet bought 12 summer take-off and landing slots, called pairs, at Gatwick and eight winter slot pairs.It also bought six summer slot pairs and one winter slot pair at Bristol.The slots will expand the airline's presence at each airport.Gatwick says it is working with EasyJet to try out new ways to board passengers at the London airport.These include boarding people in window seats first, starting at the back, followed by middle then aisle seats.Gatwick said different boarding methods could reduce the journey from airport gate to seat by about 10%.Take-off and landing slots can be highly sought after by carriers, as a lack of new runways in the UK has kept their supply low. In 2016, Oman Air paid $75m (£59m) for a single pair of slots at London Heathrow, according to The Times.Last month, the receiver sold all 555 Thomas Cook retail outlets to Hays Travel, saving up to 2,500 jobs.The independent travel agent said the move gave it shops in areas where it had little or no presence, including Scotland and Wales.Thomas Cook's Condor airline in Germany was rescued with the help of a loan from the German government.Its Nordic business was bought last month by Norwegian billionaire Petter Stordalen and private equity firms Altor and TDR Capital.Stordalen's Strawberry group and Altor took a 40% stake, with TDR Capital buying the remaining 20%.The deal for Thomas Cook Northern Europe saved 2,300 jobs.
business	Why are more retail staff working nights?	Shopping habits'Not worth the sacrifice'	"It is 09:00 in the morning and Amy has just finished her night shift at a supermarket in Greater Manchester.""Right now, I feel very tired,"" she says. ""I feel cold, I feel groggy, I've got brain fog and I'm looking forward to getting some sleep.""Research for 5 Live Money has found that between 2007 and 2017, the number of retail workers working nights as their main shift pattern has gone up 50%.Almost 70,000 people now work mainly nights in the UK retail sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Workers like Amy who only do nights are still in a minority, making up just 3% of the workforce.But 27% also juggle changing shift patterns, which can include nights or early mornings. A decade ago, that number was 18%.Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth believes a huge change in our shopping habits is behind the increase in night working.""Online is the biggest change in the sector and the requirement for delivery in 24 hours or less means more retailers are working shift patterns that will be across and through the night,"" she said.According to the latest figures from the ONS, 17.4 % of all shopping was carried out online in June this year. A decade ago, that figure was 2.7%.There have also been big changes in the make-up of the supermarket sector over the last decade. There's been a slow but steady increase in online grocery shopping, which is now worth £6.6bn in the UK and holds just over 6% of the market.Meanwhile, more convenience stores have opened which require deliveries of fresh food.The last 10 years has seen many more 24-hour supermarkets springing up, though that trend is now starting to change.Tesco, for instance, has recently reduced the number of stores open 24-seven and says it is increasingly moving towards late-night working and early-morning working to fill shelves.The ONS figures also show the number of women who only or mainly work nights has gone up by 77% since 2007, though overall, more men than women work nights.Mum-of-three Amy said she started working two nights a week because she couldn't afford the childcare to cover a day job.She usually grabs a quick nap after work before taking the children to school. Her constant exhaustion has had a negative impact on family life, she says.""It's not worth the sacrifice. The time I'm with my boys, I'm stressed and tired. I'm not myself.""School holidays are even harder. Amy said she can't afford to pay the £75 a day it would cost to put three children in a holiday club: ""When the kids are off I basically just don't get any sleep. I'll be home for six o'clock and usually they get up for about eight o'clock. And so yes, basically I stay awake.""Should employers allow staff to nap on a nightshift?Dr Helen McKenna from London's Royal Free Hospital has carried out research into optimising sleep on night shifts.""Try to get a half-an-hour nap, if it is safe to do so and if your employer will allow it,"" she says."
business	Poundworld adds to retail gloom	'Toxic mix'Carpetright closures	"Discount retailer Poundworld is looking at closing about 100 of its 355 stores, putting up to 1,500 jobs at risk.Poundworld is considering the move under an insolvency process called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA).Like many retailers Poundworld has been hit by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads and the weaker pound.Meanwhile, Carpetright's creditors and landlords have approved the company's CVA plan for about 80 closures, putting hundreds of job at risk.CVA's have become a popular among retailers because they allow firms to offload underperforming stores and reduce rents while avoiding administration.A number of retailers have chosen to go through a CVA, including New Look and Carpetright while last week House of Fraser said it was considering this measure as part of a number of options.Earlier this year, both Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin went into administration.Poundworld is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, which also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords agreed to a CVA last month. Prezzo is also closing 94 branches.Poundworld is expected to announce the terms of the CVA next month. As well as closing stores it would try to get agreement from landlords to reduce rents.The chain imports a lot of its stock and is having to pay more for it because of the fall in the value of the pound.Poundworld employs about 5,500 staff and has its headquarters in West Yorkshire.The company was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"".Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said news of Poundworld's troubles ""signals just how much distress bricks and mortar retailers are under"".""The toxic mix of rising costs, softer consumer demand and the acceleration of seismic structural shifts are pushing many business models to breaking point.""Stuck with too many stores, inflexible leases and spiraling operating costs, the business is in desperate need of restructuring.""The developments at Poundworld's emerged as Carpetright's creditors voted on the retailer's restructuring plan.Carpetright has earmarked 81 stores for closure under its CVA, which allow the firm to shut loss-making outlets and secure rent reductions.At the meeting, Carpetright won the backing of more than 75% of creditors to push ahead with the plan, which puts about 300 jobs at risk.Meanwhile, upmarket department store chain Fenwicks, which has nine branches in England and employs about 2,000 staff, is looking at ways to restructure.A company spokeswoman said the process would involve shaking up the marketing, human resources, finance and IT functions within the stores."
business	Retail sales bounce back in April	'Lacklustre' performance	"Retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 1.6% in April as consumers resumed spending after unseasonably cold weather earlier in the year.However, the Office for National Statistics said the sector remained broadly subdued, and analysts said the underlying trend was ""lacklustre"".In the three months to April, sales rose just 0.1% on the previous quarter.April's figure was boosted by a 4.7% surge in petrol sales, after falling in March because of the snow disruption.""Retail sales bounced back in April, as petrol and other sales recovered from the snowfall. But the underlying position remains subdued with the volume of goods sold over the last six months broadly unchanged,"" said Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS.""Department stores declined following relatively strong sales last month, when their online sales were boosted during the adverse weather.""Over the longer-term, retail sales growth has slowed considerably, with increases in food, household goods and internet retailers being largely offset by declines across all other types of retailing.""Online continued to take a bigger slice of spending, up from 16.1% last April to 17.3%, with both food and clothing stores achieving record online proportions.In March, sales had fallen by 1.8% and recorded their biggest quarterly fall in seven years.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the April rise reflected a recovery from snow-induced weakness in March, rather than robust spending momentum.""We continue to expect retail spending to increase only at a glacial rate this year. Consumers' confidence has weakened and savings intentions have picked up,"" he said.""The sharp rise in oil prices to nearly $80 will filter through to petrol pumps over the next three weeks, hitting petrol sales volumes and squeezing the amount of money households have left for discretionary consumption.""Ben Brettell of Hargreaves Lansdown said the underlying trend for retail sales remained ""pretty lacklustre"" and the figures were little incentive for the Bank of England to raise interest rates.""Growth is anaemic at best, and retail sales look insipid. But with inflation falling back towards target and real wages finally growing, albeit only slowly, there's little cause for alarm either,"" he said.A wide range of retailers have come under intense pressure in recent months as a combination of changing spending patterns, higher costs and online competition has forced some to the wall and others to close stores and seek rent reductions.Big names such as Toys R Us and Maplin have collapsed, while chains including Marks and Spencer, Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and House of Fraser plan to close hundreds of shops in a bid to shore up their finances.Even retailers that have not been forced to take such drastic steps are grappling with the challenge of lower margins and profitability."
business	Disability web access: 'I've already clicked away'		"Imagine entering all your details and payment card information online and then being unable to find the submit button to make a purchase.For some using screen readers, owing to sight loss or impairment, that may be the case on some websites that do not label properly. Elsewhere, websites using capitals may lead to every letter being sounded out.It does not take long for these potential customers to click away.These are examples of the costs of failing to design websites that are accessible for people with disabilities and compatible with specialist software.Campaigners at Purple, which aims to highlight the spending power of disabled people, said an estimated £11.8bn was lost every year in the resulting ""click-away"" costs.""A lot of these things can be changed in 30 seconds,"" said Mike Adams, Purple's chief executive.Born with a physical disability, Mr Adams uses dictation and a pen held in his mouth to operate his laptop computer.""If a website is too much of an ordeal or time-consuming, then I've already clicked away,"" he said.An awareness day - Purple Tuesday - is aiming to encourage businesses to sign up to an audit that should improve accessibility - physically and online - for disabled customers.It said that the Purple Pound - spending by people with disabilities - was worth about £249bn to the UK economy this year. This figure was estimated to rise by 14% each year.The organisation said that 75% of disabled people have had to leave a store or website, unable to go through with their purchase because of their disability. There are 13.9 million people with a disability in the UK, 80% of which are hidden impairments.Some £420m a week was lost to businesses that fail to pay attention to these customers, Purple estimated, and online access was a growing part of this.This might include poor mapping on websites, for those unable to operate a mouse, to the choice of colours that might affect those with colour blindness, Mr Adams said.""You don't have to make your website boring. It might be something as simple as making text available in larger fonts,"" he said.Lost sales could also come from a lack of information about access to and within physical stores, which might put off a disabled shopper from visiting.He said the issues were found across sectors, from retail and travel to insurance and banking. He encouraged these businesses to seek advice, rather than trying to self-diagnose the effectiveness of their websites.A range of businesses have done so already, introducing staff training, and changes to online and physical stores. Mr Adams said brand loyalty was very strong among people with disabilities once they find businesses they could trust and had confidence in dealing with."
business	Retailers to tackle Gove over Brexit food claims	Blame game fears	"Top retailers are holding what some describe as ""clear-the-air"" talks with government after a recent row over the impact of no-deal Brexit on the supply of fresh food in particular.The meeting is the result of a demand from some chief executives to meet the prime minister.Earlier this month, Michael Gove, his minister in charge of no-deal preparations, told the BBC: ""Everyone will have the food they need"" and ""no, there will be no shortages of fresh food.""That last point was condemned immediately by the industry group, the British Retail Consortium, as ""categorically untrue"".Indeed, the government's internal Yellowhammer no-deal document from last month, obliged to be published by the Commons before it was suspended, clearly states its reasonable worst-case planning assumption that ""certain types of fresh food supply will decrease"".There are two different meetings this afternoon with Mr Gove and a separate scheduled meeting with top civil servants, all occurring today and attended by various top retail and food chiefs from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Co-op and John Lewis, among others.Retailers have told me they are deeply wary that they are now on the end of a no-deal Brexit blame game from the Boris Johnson government, as it claims to be ready for no-deal and says the French government is ready.The message in some meetings is that the only factor that will cause disruption, tailbacks and delays is, therefore, a lack of preparedness from traders, hauliers and businesses.This has depleted levels of trust between a vital sector and the government at a tense time. Retailers report that despite some improvement in the predicted rate of flow of freight traffic across the Channel in a no-deal Brexit, the timing of Brexit Day comes at the worst possible time, with warehouses full of Christmas stock and the UK at peak dependence on European imports for fresh produce.One top retailer told me that whereas it had more than four weeks of supply in warehouses for the original March Brexit date, its current supplies are between nine and 14 days.Retailers are trying to work out exactly how to deal with a possible consumer response to no-deal. As the published Yellowhammer document puts it: ""There is a risk that panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption.""Retailers are particularly concerned that should the government, for immediate political reasons, play down the specific narrow risks to some fresh food supply, consumers will not be prepared on 1 November and will be difficult to reassure.One retailer has been reviewing the sensitivity of consumers to shops' ""just-in-time"" supply chains in previous supply disruptions, such as the fuel crisis and the ""Beast from the East"" snow disruption.""It took two weeks to get full supplies back to normal,"" one chief executive told me.Of specific concern is the interaction between social media and and localised supply shortages. In particular, the industry is wondering who exactly will reassure consumers not to stockpile.Some insiders, present at key planning meetings, believe the lack of trust of large parts of the public in politicians mean that reassurances from government ministers designed to stop panic-buying could provoke the opposite response.However, those retailers concerned by an emerging Brexit blame game are also increasingly sceptical that it is their job to be reassuring about the consequences of government policy not of their making.It was revealed in Welsh government no-deal papers released this week that a ""UK-wide table top exercise to test the coordinated response for the disruption to food supply and potential public response"" has been scheduled for the end of the month.The administration in Cardiff is believed to be particularly concerned about the impact on more remote communities at the end of supermarket supply chains. It has allocated £2m to spread food bank coverage more widely, in anticipation of rising food prices."

There's not much information in them really.""I was quite naive, and I didn't think these little purchases would affect me so much, usually between £20 and £80. If I had known, I would have just used my credit card.""Debt charities are calling on buy now pay later firms to be better at explaining risks to customers' finances in their adverts.Stepchange, the Money Advice Trust, the Debt Support Trust and Christians Against Poverty told the BBC that companies need to make terms clearer at the outset.Stuart Carmichael, chief executive of the Debt Support Trust, described some buy now pay later adverts as ""misleading"".Klarna's most popular product is called ""Pay later"". Customers have 14 or 30 days to pay off shopping they've bought online, with no added interest.Unpaid bills can be marked on a shopper's credit score, and passed to a debt collection agency. These details were not included in the Swedish company's recent advertising campaign.But, it says that all terms and conditions are displayed on its website and at the online checkouts of its 4,500 retail partners, including Asos, H&M and Topshop. It also told the BBC no complaints had ever been upheld about its ads.New Zealand firm Laybuy launched in the UK in early 2019, followed by Clearpay in June. Clearpay is owned by Australian-based company Afterpay Touch and says it already has more than 200,000 customers.It has partnered up with retailer Marks and Spencer to offer the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in four instalments.See it, love it, get it, pay in four.

Late payments to Clearpay can also be added to credit records.Clearpay pointed out that it caps late fees at £36 or 25% of the order value (whichever is lowest), and that it has not received any complaints about its adverts.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sets and enforces rules for financial companies which it authorises. Its guidelines say that adverts should:""Firms have a duty to ensure that their promotions are clear, fair and not misleading, and failure to do so could fall under the regulator's gaze,"" said Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?.""Buy now pay later firms have become increasingly popular in recent years, especially among young people who may not hold other forms of credit.""The FCA is introducing new rules on buy now pay later services, including store cards and catalogue payment plans.They will require companies to tell consumers when a 0% interest offer expires, and stop them from backdating interest charges on money that has been repaid during such an offer period.Online fashion retailers with many young customers offer buy now pay later services: JD Sports, Quiz, Pretty Little Thing and Boohoo are just a few.Instagram influencers and Love Island contestants are often tagged in posts by these firms.Thanks to everyone who came along to the launch of the #HouseofKlarna last night!

business	Harrogate: What happened when the shops left town		"Cream teas, quaint streets and stylish shops have made Harrogate one of the most successful and popular shopping destinations in the north of England.But there are now gaps on its High Street like never before.""Five years ago it would be unheard of to have large empty units on James Street, the prime shopping street in our town. Businesses were fighting to get into these units,"" says Robert Ogden, who jointly runs a family jewellery business on the street.This attractive spa town has weathered the huge changes taking place in retail better than most places.But in the past two years it's seen a succession of big name chains pull out, such as Topman, Miss Selfridge, Cath Kidston, Prezzo and Jamie's Italian.Many have been the result of restructuring deals known as company voluntary arrangements (CVA).They're a form of insolvency proceedings which struggling businesses can enter into with their creditors - including landlords and suppliers - to cut costs.CVAs have become a controversial escape route for retailers as it allows them to close stores they no longer want. Since January 2018, 23 chains in Harrogate have done CVAs.According to research compiled for BBC News by the Local Data Company (LDC), 1,676 stores in the UK have closed across these brands, including 302 casual dining outlets. The LDC found that 63% were still sitting empty by the end of August this year.Harrogate along with Reading, Birmingham and Nottingham are the four locations most affected with 10 closures each.""I suppose we all got a little complacent and thought it wouldn't happen here,"" says Mr Ogden.Expertise, service and some eye-catching jewels have helped keep his business trading in the same ornate store for more than a century. But he says Harrogate isn't immune from the challenges of consumers' changing shopping habits as well as rising costs.""The cost of trading in Harrogate is quite high,"" Mr Ogden says. ""The rents are high, the rates are high and if footfall just drops off a fraction, it becomes less viable for these larger chains to trade from Harrogate.""We've got to start acting and reacting to what's happening, for instance some free parking would help entice more shoppers into town.""So, how might the vacant space be filled?A few streets away, the Early Learning Centre is still sitting empty some nine months after its management did a CVA.""It was all very sudden,"" says letting agent Robin Hanson. ""They left and handed back the keys. It's an old Victorian building and the landlord was left with all the fixtures and fittings as well as repairs. It'll cost as much as a £100,000 to put right and re-let.""It's the toughest market that this property expert has ever seen.""Rent and rates are very big overheads, so landlords are looking at having to reduce rents. There's a shop just let in Harrogate at half the rent that the previous tenants were paying,"" Mr Hanson says.""The government needs to reduce the business rates liability and I also think the council needs to reduce car parking costs.""He says the landlord for the former ELC property doesn't want to take his chances by leasing to another retail chain. He's after a local trader looking to expand.When Jessica Wyatt and her mum spotted a big gap on James Street, they decided to make a move, relocating their quirky cafe, Mama Doreen's.Carluccio's, the casual dining chain, did a CVA and pulled out. The company had signed a 25-year lease as it rapidly over-expanded.Ms Wyatt says: ""We'd been trading for 11 years and had premises just down the road. We'd been looking for the right location to expand. We did get a decent deal and our landlord has been lovely. He could see it would work and he's taken a chance on us.""The cafe has only been open four weeks, but is doing a roaring trade, she says.""It's so sad to see all these empty shops. We felt like our presence was needed in the town centre as an independent. We need more independents and we need Harrogate to be back on top.""Amid the turmoil on our High Streets, Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company, says there is appetite for new space and the biggest growth is coming from independent retailers.""The challenges facing national chains have presented an opportunity for local independent business to open in these once unaffordable locations using local support and a new, authentic offer to tailor products and services to the local population.""While other towns are struggling for survival, the challenge here in Harrogate is to keep it special.""What we don't want to be is a plush dormitory for Leeds or London,"" says Mr Ogden.""We've got to be a destination for shopping and we need to maintain that crown."""
business	Discounts and online help retail sales bounce back in July	Wage growth weak	"UK retail sales increased by 0.7% in July, ahead of expectations.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures also showed that retail sales rose by 3.5% in the year to July.ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said: ""Many consumers stayed away from some High Street stores in July, but online sales were very strong, supported by several retailers launching promotions.""Food sales remained robust as people continued to enjoy the World Cup and the sunshine.""On the three-month measure for May to July, sales rose 2.1%, the strongest three months since February 2015.The sales growth comes despite continuing pressures on High Street stores and weakened household spending power as pay growth struggles to outpace inflation.Clothing sales recorded their strongest year-on-year growth since December, also helped by sales promotions, the ONS added.Total spending online continued to increase, to reach a new record proportion of all retailing at 18.2% in July 2018.Meanwhile, online spending via department store websites also reached a record proportion of their total sales, at 18.2%.Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the robust retail sales for July suggested ""some recovery in consumer spending is in the pipeline"".He said: ""Of course, retail sales only account for about a third of total household spending, so the strength of spending on the High Street could be offset by households reducing their outlay elsewhere.""Analysis: Jonty Bloom, BBC Business correspondentWhile the good weather may have distorted these figures by keeping people off the baking hot High Street and at home shopping on their computers instead, the remorseless advance of online shopping is hard to deny.It now accounts for a record 18.2% of all spending in the UK, a rise on last year of more than 15%. That boom was helped in the last month by a splurge of promotions by online shopping sites that increased sales, including Amazon Prime Day.But an interesting aspect of the figures is that this is not just about new burgeoning online giants snatching business away from the traditional High Street. Department stores are rapidly moving into this area, their sales online have increased by 35% in the last year, so almost twice as quickly as the average.That reflects a trend of even the largest department stores becoming more like shop windows, with shoppers visiting them to see the range and choice available but then going home to order online.""Admittedly, still-weak real wage growth will weigh on consumer spending,"" Mr Wishart added. ""Nonetheless, the retail sales data provides reason to think that consumer spending growth could post a slightly improved performance in the third quarter.""Following the announcement, the pound was up 0.24% against the dollar at $1.2727.Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said: ""The reaction from the pound... has been muted, suggesting that the wider view of the UK economy is still bleak.""With the chances of a no-deal Brexit scenario high, wage growth shrinking and inflation rising, the Bank of England may find it difficult to follow through on any previous notions of further interest rate hikes in the future.""As long as this outlook remains, the pound will continue to be under sustained pressure."""
business	Pound drops below $1.30 as June retail sales fall	'Good result' for food	"The pound has fallen under $1.30 after a surprise fall in retail sales in June, confounding expectations of an increase.The Office for National Statistics said sales fell by 0.5% last month compared with May - below forecasts of a 0.2% rise.While the World Cup and hot weather helped food and drink sales, they also kept shoppers away from high streets.The weak figures cast doubt on whether interest rates will rise next month.Sterling is down almost 0.7% at $1.2980 against the dollar - the lowest since September last year.The Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates in August. But following the inflation figures released earlier this week, economists were divided on whether it would do so.Tom Stevens at Fidelity International, said: ""An August rate hike is in the balance. Whether or not one is delivered, the trajectory thereafter will be extremely shallow.""The ONS figures also showed that retail sales rose by 2.9% in the year to June, a slowdown from the 4.1% annual increase recorded in May and below forecasts of a 3.5%. rise.However, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the data would not ""undermine the [Bank of England] Monetary Policy Committee's judgement that the economy rebounded in the second quarter"".In the April-to-June quarter retail sales increased by 2.1% - the biggest quarterly rise since 2015.ONS senior statistician Rhian Murphy said: ""Retail sales grew strongly across the three months to June 2018 as the warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy food and drink for their BBQs.""However, in June retail sales actually fell back slightly, with continued growth in food sales offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave.""Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""Some of the second-quarter's strength reflects temporary factors, such as a boost from the warm weather and the Royal Wedding celebrations.""Crucially, though, the big constraint on spending - namely the squeeze on real wages from high inflation - has eased.""Economic data out earlier this week showed that while wage growth has slowed to 2.7%, it remains above inflation.Ms Gregory said: ""While this week's unexpectedly-weak inflation figures have made the outlook for an interest rate rise in August rather less clear-cut, the recovery in the consumer sector supports our view that a hike is still more likely than not.""Between May and June, non-food sales fell by 1.1%, with demand for clothing down 0.8%.Mr Tombs added: ""Many households [had] already brought seasonal apparel when the weather also was unusually warm in April and May.""Food sales rose by 0.1% in June, which he said was a ""good result"" following substantial increases in April and May.""The World Cup might have helped to support food sales, by encouraging people to stay in rather than eat out, though note that England's three knock-out games that led to huge TV audiences didn't happen until July,"" Mr Tombs added."
business	Royal wedding and hot weather boost retail sales	Tough timesReal pay rises	"The hot weather and royal wedding celebrations contributed to another strong rise in retail sales last month, official figures have indicated.Retail sales volumes rose 1.3% in May from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said, following April's increase of 1.8%.Sales in May were up 3.9% from the same month a year earlier, a 13-month high.Retailers said the royal wedding and good weather had encouraged spending in food and household goods stores.The ONS figures echo the findings of the latest survey from the British Retail Consortium, which also cited the weather and the royal wedding as factors lifting sales in May.The stronger-than-expected data may bring some relief for the retail sector, which has seen a string of bad news recently from some high-profile names.Last week, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 stores, while earlier this week, discount chain Poundworld went into administration.Earlier on Thursday, the company behind the Simply Be and Jacamo clothing brands, N Brown, said it was considering closing its 20 remaining shops and becoming a pure online retailer.The decision puts 270 jobs at risk.Also, Majestic Wine warned that trading conditions were deteriorating.Chief executive Rowan Gormley said: ""We expect the UK market to remain tough, possibly even tougher than last year.""Certainly trading since year-end has been harder than the prior year in the UK.""The hot weather in May and early June was not good for everyone. Revolution Bars said the warm weather had ""curtailed typical late-night weekend trading"" at its 72 bars.It also blamed cold weather in March for a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales in the first half of the year.Economists are divided about the outlook for UK retail sales.Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest data added to evidence that spending had ""picked up some pace following the softness at the start of the year"".""With real pay rises in prospect, consumer spending should receive more fundamental support as the year progresses,"" she added.""Overall, then, today's figures support our view that annual spending growth should pick up from 1.1% in Q1 to about 2% by early 2019, helping the economy to regain some momentum.""However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said May's sales jump had ""all the hallmarks of a weather-related blip, rather than a sustainable pick-up in spending"".""The average level of non-food sales in the first five months of 2018 is exactly the same as in the last five months of 2017, so the underlying trend in sales still looks pretty flat.""May's sales increase was much larger than analysts had expected, and the news pushed up the value of the pound. Sterling was up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.3440."
business	Tesco boss blames business rates for retail woes		"The boss of Britain's biggest supermarket has blamed the collapse of some retailers partly on the expense of business rates.Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, said the charges that firms must pay on their buildings played a ""large part"" in sending some retailers to the wall.Last year a revamp of business rates saw some bills rise, while others fell.He questioned whether raising business rates was resulting in an ""uneven playing field"" for some firms.Retail is the UK's biggest private sector employer, Mr Lewis told the BBC.""Are we allowing it to stay competitive, or are we by stealth lowering corporation tax and increasing business rates to a place which is creating an uneven playing field and forcing people to think about how it is they avoid that cost and find other routes to the market?"" he asked.The Tesco boss said business rates was the biggest tax his company paid, adding up to more than £700m a year.""You need a level playing field ... between an online digital world and a traditional retail store base model like the one we have,"" Mr Lewis said.Business rates changes 'threaten high streets'Mr Lewis also took ministers to task for ignoring retail - as well as the food industry - in the government's industrial strategy.His plea for action on business rates echoes comments made last year by Mike Coupe, chief executive of rival supermarket Sainsbury's.He called for ""fundamental reforms"" to the ""archaic"" business rates system, which ignored the rise of online retailers based in out-of-town warehouses.Sainsbury's recently announced plans to merge with Asda in a deal that would create the UK's biggest supermarket operator, eclipsing Tesco.Despite the hefty charges faced by retailers with large numbers of physical stores, Mr Lewis says shops are ""definitely here to stay"".He conceded that Tesco has more retail space than it needs, prompting it to try ideas like bringing in other brands such as Holland and Barratt to offer customers something different.Too much space is just one problem supermarkets are grappling with: they are also threatened by online retailers such as Amazon.It now owns the upmarket US grocery chain Whole Foods and earlier this year opened a supermarket with no checkouts in Seattle as a testbed.Doug Gurr, Amazon's UK boss, said most retailers now have a mix of online and physical store sales.""There's huge value in walking in and touching and feeling products … but at the same time there's a huge convenience in being able to order products on my phone, on my tablet, to be able to order 24 hours a day,"" he said.Retailers that want to give customers what they want will have a ""blend of the two"", he added.Mr Gurr highlights an Amazon seller who has run a record store in Stirling for more than 25 years. Now more than three quarters of his sales are online to customers around the world.""It's going so well he's actually been able to open two more physical shops in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, so that for me is really where we're going,"" he said. ""I think you'll see a much more hybrid model.""Meanwhile, Marks & Spencer chairman Archie Norman has summed up the challenges to retail in the company's annual report published on Thursday, saying the ""tide is running more strongly against us now than at any previous time"".M&S plans to close 100 UK stores by 2022 in a move it says is vital for the retailer's future.He added: ""There is no doubt in my mind that we face formidable headwinds and transformational changes are needed.""The continued migration of clothing and home online, the further development of global competition, the growth of home delivery in food and the march of the discounters all amount to threats that are eroding our business and market position.""These, together with a challenging UK consumer market, mean that we have a burning platform. Accelerated change is the only option."""
business	Shop closures hit UK's smaller retail centres hardest	Barbershops boom	"Smaller shopping centres bore the brunt of store closures last year, according to a study of vacancies in the retail and leisure sectors.Centres ranked 300 or lower in the Local Data Company's (LDC) index saw vacancies rise from 19.7% to 19.9%.In contrast, vacancies fell in the UK's top 50 shopping centres, underlining a significant polarisation, the LDC said.The report also found that niche restaurants are booming, with vegan, Jamaican and South American expanding.The LDC found that the overall vacancy rate last year rose for the first time since it started measuring it. But this was only a marginal 0.2% rise, giving an annual rate of 11.2% - the same as in 2016.It meant that headlines about the ""death of the High Street"" may be overdone, according to LDC's senior relationship manager, Lucy Stainton.""This increase in vacancy is perhaps more marginal than might have been expected given some of the current rhetoric,"" she said.However, the report points out that there have been significant closures and restructuring this year, including Maplin, Carpetright and Toys 'R' Us that will be included in this year's numbers.Retail parks remain the most desirable location, with occupation rates rising by 0.85% in 2017. However, the closures at chains such as Carpetright and Toys 'R' Us means that growth could be reversed this year.Yorkshire and the Humber, Greater London and Scotland were the areas where vacancy rates increased most, while the West Midlands saw the fewest closures.The report also found:One area that seemed to do particularly well last year was niche restaurants. The number of vegan outlets rose 61.5%, at the expense of vegetarian restaurants, which fell 70%, according to the LDC. The number of Jamaican, Brazilian and Argentinian restaurants also increased.Since 2012, more than 2,000 barbers have opened their doors, plus 1,235 more coffee shops and 2,000 vaping shops. These are sub-sectors that cannot be replicated online, Ms Stainton said.She added: ""There is no denying that retail is going through an unprecedented era of change, but as our latest research highlights, it's crucial to get underneath the overarching trends to understand the detail beneath this, giving us a glimpse of our future high street."""
business	Retailers shut 2,870 stores in first half of 2019	High profile administrations	"About 16 shops are closing every day as retailers restructure their businesses and more shopping moves online.A net 1,234 stores shut on Britain's top 500 high streets in the first half of the year, according to research by PwC and the Local Data Company.That is up from 1,123 in the same period last year and the highest since the survey began in 2010.Fashion retailers saw the biggest declines in the period, followed by restaurants, estate agents and pubs.However, there were more openings of takeaways and sport and health clubs.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: ""The decline in store numbers in the first half of 2019 shows that there's been no let-up in the changing ways that people shop and the cost pressures affecting High Street operators.""She said retailers had to invest more in making stores ""relevant to today's consumers"", but added that ""new and different types of operators"" needed encouragement to fill vacant space.According to PwC, 1,634 stores opened in the six months to the end of June - a 4% increase on the same period last year - while 2,868 stores shut. The data looks at retail chains with more than five outlets.High Street retailers continue to face growing competition from online operators such as Amazon, making it harder to pay their rents and other overheads, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates.It has led to big names such as Toys R Us going into administration, while others such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, Debenhams and New Look have announced large-scale closures.According to PwC, fashion retail continued to be the hardest hit sector in the six months to June, with 10 stores a week closing, mainly as a result of high profile administrations and restructuringsMeanwhile, there were net declines of 103 restaurants, 100 estate agents and 96 pubs.Greater London saw the largest number of net closures of any region, although when taking into account its higher number of shops, its closure rate was in line with the national average.The East Midlands, North East, South East and Yorkshire and the Humber were the only regions to see fewer closures than last year."
business	How convenience stores are surviving the retail storm	Not much time for banksSmall impactRural storesOnline boost	"The fruit and vegetables lining the front of the grocers, Cruson, in Camberwell Church Street in London are tempting - but not massively consequential.Yet this is just a tiny tip of a multi-billion pound sector comparable in size to oil and gas or defence.At £38bn, the UK convenience store sector makes up one-fifth of the country's total grocery market.And as the supermarkets and High Street chains fight tooth and nail for market share, the convenience store sector is holding its own.Aris, who runs Cruson, has been here since he left Cyprus in 1960.He won't tell me his other name and I am left wondering if it's his family name or first name.""It's Aris, just Aris. No one knows my other name."" he says. ""If you say it, you write it down, everyone will say, 'who is that man, I never heard of him'.""He still speaks with a Cypriot accent, 58 years after he arrived in London.Aris wasn't always a shopkeeper. In the 1960s, he started by working in his cousin's Old Compton Street hairdressers cutting the hair of celebrities, including giving a shave to boxer Henry Cooper in 1963, the day after he had his face gashed open by Mohammed Ali.Camberwell has changed since Aris moved here in 1970. The first supermarket arrived in the 1980s and old family stores dropped away; a Tesco Express started up 400 yards away; and the early customers, the Cypriot and Jamaican communities, thinned out. But Cruson is still here, with its vegetables and fruit display edging out onto the pavement each morning.Since the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) started surveying local stores in 2012 the sector has grown every year, despite supermarket competition, names vanishing from the High Street and customers increasingly going online.It is also remarkably financially self-sufficient. These shops don't have much time for banks and almost three-quarters fund investments from their own pockets - last year that came to over £800m.A slight frisson did run through the sector last year when Co-op bought convenience store chain Nisa and wholesaler Booker was bought by Tesco.Yet the effect seems muted so far. Chris Noice, ACS head of communications, says: ""Those take-overs have may have changed things on the wholesale end, but it's not clear yet - it's very much a work in process.""It may well bring down wholesale prices which would be good for the whole retail industry.""The big supermarkets have tried to make inroads into this market with the likes of Sainsbury Local and Tesco Express, but so far they make up roughly 1,500 of the UK's 50,000 convenience stores.Even chains such as Costcutter, Nisa, Spar or McColls, account for less than a quarter of the total. The remaining 75% are still in the hands of independents like Aris.And they have another key advantage over the big players - about three-quarters of them own their own leases or freeholds.All convenience stores, big and small, have to pay rates, but as Mr Noice points out, the independents are light on their feet: ""They are very good and adaptable at keeping their costs down.""Tesco's business model means that a store manager will have data from Tesco Club Cards to guide him, but he or she can't react fast to demand. A small independent will react to his customer more by feel - if they see something is needed they'll do it.""The result can seem to be something of an anomaly.Aris' fruit and veg displays are the only ones to be seen on Church Street. He admits ruefully the market isn't what it was: ""Nowadays the young people don't cook. It's a pizza, it's a kebab, if you show them vegetables they don't know what to do with them.""Even so, he's not short of loyal customers for his taramasalata or lugging in his watermelons up to the till.He's one of the few retailers to stock ugli fruit - a wrinkled Jamaican orange-tangerine-grapefruit hybrid - and he does a good line in tomato plants and herbs for locals wanting something green to perch on a windowsill or trail across an urban trellis.Don't let anyone tell you it's an easy life. Aris seldom gets to bed before 11pm and three days a week he is up at 3.30 am to get to the market. On average a convenience store is open more than 14 hours a day, and a fifth of storekeepers take no annual holiday.John Augustine has a different story altogether. A former marketing manager for southern India for the American wines and spirits business Brown Foreman, he came to the UK 17 years ago.Now with his business partner Renchu Sachivothaman, he owns Matt's Food Wine and More in the village of Barrow in west Suffolk and has another store in Ipswich.""It was simple really. I just didn't want to work for anyone else any more. I wanted to be my own boss,"" he says.He has ambitions beyond retail, with an eye to buying property and branching into healthcare once he can build up enough capital.The store is polished and professional, managed by Lee Button, a former Shell manager who lives in Barrow.Part of the reason stores like this exist is the sparsity of rural shops. Some 40% of convenience stores are in isolated areas. In Barrow there is competition a few yards down the road - the Barrow Convenience Store, part of the Premier chain. But the village is growing fast. There's a new housing estate half a mile away and Mr Augustine says there is room for them both.""If we had to rely on just Barrow the two of us wouldn't be able to survive, but there are five of six other villages around which have no shop at all, and who depend on us, and there is passing traffic too southwards from the A14,"" he says.As for online shopping, the convenience stores are playing an unexpected trump card says Mr Noise: ""The competition from online can actually work to their advantage because they can serve as a pick-up and drop-off point.""It is that last mile that the online delivery services really struggle with, and convenience stores can play an important role in getting stuff to customers.""Matt's Food Wine and More serves as a collection point for MyHermes parcels which has about fifty regular users. The store also has a Facebook page. Manager Lee Button says: ""It's used by people in the villages who normally wouldn't drop in. But this way they find out about what we do online or whether we have something in stock.""The convenience store serves one other unexpected role: an engine of social mobility.According to ACS, only a quarter of the stores are inherited. The children of convenience store owners, it seems, move onwards and upwards.Mr Augustine bought his Barrow business from Yogi Patel who still lives in the village, but who ran a total of 19 convenience stores. Mr Patel's son works for Citibank.As one generation steps down there is no shortage of newcomers wanting to take over. Aris, standing among his fruit and veg, is philosophical: ""There will be someone else to take my place eventually. They will be Indian or Vietnamese, someone new. There is always going to be a shop here.""As for Aris' son, he has no interest in taking on the Cruson store. He works round the corner. He is a dentist at King's College hospital."
business	Town centres could become ghost towns, warns former retail chief	'Unique history'Free parking	"Britain's town centres are ""in big danger of becoming ghost towns in the future"" if immediate action is not taken, warns a former retail chief.Bill Grimsey, former head of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, launches his second report into the future of town centres and High Streets on Wednesday.He told the BBC: ""We must act now.""Forget retail for town centres, they need to become community hubs based on health, education, entertainment, leisure and arts and crafts.""Mr Grimsey's report says that facilities such as libraries and digital and health hubs should be part of the offering to bring back people to town centres, together with housing and some independent shops.And he explained to the BBC: ""We are social animals. We need gathering places as otherwise we are going to have a generation of very lonely people growing up.""Retailers on UK High Streets have been hit by weak sales, online competition and rising costs, affecting 22,000 jobs this year.High-profile failures include Maplin and Toys R Us while High Street chains such as Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Carphone Warehouse, New Look and Carpetright have announced store closure plans.Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium has called for a two-year freeze on business rates increases to help provide some financial relief for the retail industry.""The retail industry, the UK's largest private sector employer, makes up 5% of the economy and pays nearly 25% of the overall business rates bill, over £7bn per year,"" it said. ""This is a disproportionate burden and is leading to decisions to close stores, while at the same time getting in the way of the modernisation and reinvention of Britain's High Streets.""Mr Grimsey's original report was published in 2013 after he disagreed with the findings of a different study by retail expert Mary Portas.One place which followed his recommendations was Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east of England.Neil Schneider, chief executive of the town's borough council, says: ""The vision for Stockton was to develop a big outdoor community centre.""In our plan we wanted to capitalise on the area's unique history and heritage, support a wide range of retailers and businesses, and improve the connections to the attractive riverside.""By developing safe evening and leisure opportunities in interesting spaces, we wanted to ensure that people don't come to Stockton just to shop. We really wanted to create a community hub destination.""Near the end of 2017, Mr Grimsey decided to publish a second edition of his report and he is confident that it could have a more widespread positive outcome.He has had support from Conservative MP Jake Berry, as well as Andy Street, the first mayor of the West Midlands who was the managing director of John Lewis, the department store group.""All I want to do is help make a difference and I think that this time around, it will get traction. Political figures are joining in and it's a clarion call for action.""The new report has 25 recommendations in three sections, which cover:Mr Grimsey puts the High Street's decline down to the growth in popularity of out-of-town shopping centres with their free parking, as well as online shopping.But he dismissed the idea that free or cheaper parking being reintroduced into High Streets would revitalise them.""If it was that simple then people would have done it already,"" he said.""The point is that the retail proposition in town centres has been overtaken by the more convenient out-of-town parks. The town centres should say 'let them have it'.""In my generation as retailers, we successfully cloned every town in Britain so they all looked the same, but clearly that doesn't work.""All the towns have a heritage and history and their reason for uniqueness needs to be brought to the fore.""We need to repopulate these places and local authorities are the key to unlocking this, along with good leadership. Where it happens it can work."""
business	Retail sales boosted by hot weather and royal wedding	PageantryCar sales 'encouraging'	"Warmer weather, bank holidays and the royal wedding helped to boost retail sales in May, a survey has indicated.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said total sales rose by 4.1% in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace for more than four years.However, the BRC noted that retail conditions remained tough, with growth ""very low by historical standards"".Separate figures from the motor industry showed that UK vehicle sales rose by a ""modest"" 3.4% in May.Last month's sunnier weather tempted shoppers out to the shops after the freezing start to 2018, the BRC survey found.Sales were also helped by the two bank holidays and the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.A separate report from Barclaycard echoed the BRC's findings. It found that consumer spending in May was up 5.1% from a year earlier - the highest rate since April 2017.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG - which helped to produce the BRC survey, said: ""Two bank holiday weekends, a royal wedding and of course sunnier spells will have been the main drivers behind the apparent rebound, with both online and High Street sales thankfully up overall.""BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Better weather and the bank holiday effect led shoppers to buy from garden furniture and summer fashion ranges, recovering some of the ground lost in April.""However, she added: ""The FA Cup Final and royal wedding may have got the nation in the mood for celebration but the day itself was a distraction for shoppers as they stayed at home to watch the festivities; sales also tailed off once the party was over.""In addition, Ms Dickinson said the ""retail environment remains extremely challenging"" with tight margins and fierce competition.Retailers in the UK have been hit by factors such as a fall in discretionary spending after a squeeze on pay, rising overheads, and too much debt.On Tuesday, online electrical retailer AO World reported a pre-tax loss of £13.5m for the year to 31 March - nearly double the £7m loss in the previous year - due to higher marketing costs and a ""consistently competitive pricing environment"".New car registrations rose 3.4% to 192,649 in May after large declines in 2017, according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).That growth followed a ""substantial"" 8.5% drop the previous May, it said.Demand for ""alternatively fuelled vehicles"" such as electric and hybrid cars rose by 36.1%. Petrol car sales also increased, by 23.5%, but demand for diesels fell for the 14th consecutive month, down 23.6%.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""May's growth, albeit on the back of large declines last year, is encouraging and suggests the market is now starting to return to a more natural running rate."""
business	Supermarkets drive retail sales higher in February	'Champagne remains on ice'	"Retail sales volumes picked up in February after growing by 0.8% compared with January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Growth, which beat analysts' forecasts for a 0.4% rise, was driven by petrol, supermarkets and online shopping.ONS senior statistician, Rhian Murphy, said: ""Store prices continue to rise across all store types, but at a lower rate than the previous month.""Inflation slowed to a seven-month low of 2.7% in February.While supermarket sales by value rose by 0.6% in February, trade at non-food shops fell by 0.3%, which the ONS attributed to consumers choosing to spend their money on essential items.A number of non-food retailers have been facing difficulties recently, including Toys R Us, which has gone into administration, and fashion chain New Look, which is closing 60 UK stores and cutting 1,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan.Although sales rose in February, this followed two monthly declines in December and January, and the ONS said this meant sales fell 0.4% in the three months to February.Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The champagne remains on ice for now. The monthly numbers are always volatile and the underlying trend is still one of weakness.""There's also a risk of further disappointment in March, with the Beast from the East bringing economic disruption and keeping consumers at home.""Sales in February were up by 1.5% compared to the same month last year. This was above analysts' expectations of a 1.3% rise but below the 1.6% annual increase recorded in January.Keith Richardson, managing director, retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said it had been a ""mixed month"" and the Beast from the East delayed the launch of spring ranges ""with heavy coats still very much in demand"".Commenting on the outlook for the industry, he said: ""Consumers are still being cautious and will only spend if the offer is absolutely right.""He added: ""Some retailers with significant physical estates and less successful online operations have closed in recent weeks. Unless shoppers can be persuaded to start spending soon, others may yet follow."""
business	UK wage growth slows as unemployment falls	Beware the rollercoaster of employment figures	"UK wage growth slowed down in the three months to September, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Unemployment dropped by 23,000 to 1.31 million over the same period, while the number of people in work also fell.Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 3.6%, compared with 3.8% growth in the previous month.The figures also showed the biggest annual drop in the number of job vacancies in nearly 10 years.The ninth consecutive monthly fall in available jobs saw advertised positions fall by 18,000 to 800,000.There were 32,75 million people in work during the three-month period, a fall of 58,000. It was the biggest drop since May 2015, when the total fell by 65,000.The ONS said this was down to falling numbers of people working in retail, after the collapse of several store chains and the implementation of shop closure programmes by other firms.Average weekly pay, in real terms before tax, was £470.""The employment rate is higher than a year ago, though broadly unchanged in recent months. Vacancies have seen their biggest annual fall since late 2009, but remain high by historical standards,"" said an ONS spokesperson.""The number of EU nationals in work was very little changed on the year, with almost all the growth in overseas workers coming from non-EU nationals.""It comes after last week's news that the UK's economy had grown at the slowest annual rate in almost a decade.Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures were likely to mean interest rates would stay unchanged for the foreseeable future.""The pace of weakening in the labour market remains gradual enough for the Monetary Policy Committee to hold back from cutting bank rate over the coming months,"" he said.Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC head of statisticsHow do we know whether any month's change is a blip or a turning point?Estimates of employment are based on a survey and so come with a margin of error.The ONS say not to worry about changes smaller than 150,000 people.But every monthly change in the unemployment rate has been smaller than the margin of error for ten years.So we have to get a feel for the underlying picture by combining figures like unemployment with other measures like wages and job vacancies and using judgement.But be warned.If anyone could time a turn in economic conditions precisely, they'd be too busy getting rich to tell you.So pay most attention to the long, slow trends.IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said the falling numbers of working people and job vacancies showed data ""was falling into line with earlier warning signs of a weakening labour market from the surveys"".He added: ""Recruitment agencies reported that the demand for permanent staff at employers had grown at the joint slowest rate for a decade in October, as uncertainty and worries about the outlook reduced firms' appetite to take on extra employees.""Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Overall, the figures appear to illustrate that demand for labour is easing, but no sharp downturn, which is a relief following disappointing GDP growth in the third quarter.""Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, warned that wage growth could continue to slow down.""The pick-up in wage growth earlier this year has been a plus, but there is clearly a limit to how high pay packets can go. With many firms facing elevated costs and difficulties raising their productivity game, the margins to raise pay are eroding. A further acceleration in wages now looks unlikely,"" he said."
business	Primark and JD Sports buck UK retail gloom	'Headwinds'	"Associated British Foods, owner of Primark, has hailed the clothing chain's UK performance as ""remarkable"" after a boost in like-for-like sales.However, the UK results were not enough to offset a decline in Primark's same-store sales overall.Retailer JD Sports also reported a rise in sales, which it said was ""an excellent result"".The UK results of both firms come despite the crisis faced by some High Street chains.In the 24 weeks to 3 March, Primark saw 3% growth in its UK like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings.This increase came ""against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe"" and a decline in margins due to adverse currency movements.""Our UK performance was remarkable in the circumstances and delivered a strong increase in our share of the total clothing market,"" it said.However, this was not enough to boost its overall like-for-like sales, which fell 1.5% after ""unseasonably warm weather in October"" and ""freezing temperatures across northern Europe"". Sales in Northern Europe declined in the period.Primark has 352 stores worldwide, with 184 in the UK. There was a drop in sales in Germany, where the chain has 25 stores.The fashion chain owner said it expected profit growth to pick up in the second half.Associated British Foods (ABF) had ""successfully navigated a brace of headwinds"" including challenges in its sugar business and unseasonal weather said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon.""What's impressive in these results is management's assertion that profitability in the all-important retail division will rise in the second half.""Part of this is due to the benefit of a weaker dollar, but Primark has managed its stock well and improved its buying positions too,"" Mr Salmon said.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales at JD Sports stores grew 3%, while profits were up by 26%, in the 53 weeks to 3 February.""This is an excellent result demonstrating our capacity for continuing growth in both existing and new markets, and the strength of our offer in store and online,"" said Peter Cowgill, JD Sports executive chairman.Chains on the UK High Street have been facing a combination of a squeeze on incomes and rising overheads.Prezzo, New Look and Carpetright are among the big names that have been struggling recently."
business	Five things to do with empty retail space	1. Gyms2. Crazy golf and climbing walls3. Prosecco and patisserie4. Houses and flats5. Discounting and convenience	"So far, 2018 has been a rough year on the High Street. Toys R Us and Maplin have collapsed, while New Look and Mothercare have announced closures, as have Jamie's Italian, burger chain Byron and Prezzo.They're the latest victims of increased online shopping and higher overheads. The shift to online and more frequent food shopping also means some retailers have more store space than they need.So what's happening to the space that's being freed up?Talk to anyone in retailing today and they'll tell you ""experiences"" are crucial - an effective way for bricks and mortar retailers to differentiate themselves from online.Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says experiences are about ""what Amazon can't do"".Retailers need to create an interesting experience that ""drives footfall and better loyalty and creates an environment that can't be replicated online"", he adds. Gyms are a case in point and they've been busily snapping up empty retail space.Low-cost operator The Gym Group has opened up in part of a former BHS in Walthamstow, north London. It's also rented excess space from Sainsbury's at its store at Murrayfield in Edinburgh.Founder John Treharne says: ""We have always converted retail space - there just happens to be more of it available today.""And it's not just gyms getting in on the act. ""Competitive socialising"" is a big thing these days, says Colin Flinn, regional managing director of shopping centre owner intu, whose properties include Lakeside in Essex and the Trafford Centre in Manchester.Ping-pong bars, trampoline parks, social darts, indoor golf, climbing walls, escape rooms and virtual reality games are all growing in popularity - and are on the hunt for suitable space.That can be empty space in shops. For instance, crazy golf operator Swingers has moved into the first floor of the former BHS flagship store on London's Oxford Street.Co-founder Matt Grech-Smith says snapping up the site was as ""no-brainer"", because it's ""literally a stone's throw from the ultra-high footfall of Oxford Circus. Sites in a location as prime as this don't come along very often - especially sites this big.""But the big and successful shopping centres are also attracting activities. ""Major regional [shopping] centres are becoming 'resorts',"" says intu's Mr Flinn. ""Customers can either pop in to do a quick shop or spend a full day with the family.""A key focus for retailers and shopping centres is turning themselves into ""destinations"" - persuading people to visit and stay for longer, rather than simply ordering stuff online.Next's revamped store in Manchester's Arndale Centre includes a prosecco bar, a barber, a children's activity centre and, in the summer, a car showroom. It's also in talks with a spa operator.A Next spokeswoman says the idea is to give ""people a real reason to come to the store - people aren't browsing as much as they were before. Lots of things under one roof is far more appealing to a shopper.""Debenhams has also gone down this route. Boss Sergio Bucher says the focus of its strategy is leisure and ""social shopping"".It's ramped up its food offering and the likes of Patisserie Valerie and Nandos are now in some stores.It has also teamed up with gym operator Sweat, with the first gym due to open later this year, and taken a stake in beauty company Blow Ltd, which has opened salons in store.""When people go shopping with friends, they tend to spend more,"" says a Debenhams spokesperson. ""Destination is really important for all department store operators.""Recently, department store group John Lewis kitted out a fully furnished apartment in three of its stores. Customers could stay overnight and order dinner, while everything in the flat was for sale.The department store group says customers are increasingly using its stores as a ""leisure destination"" and as a convenient place for click-and-collect.""This means that our strategy in shops focuses much more on experiences and giving people a reason to come in and visit us,"" says a spokeswoman.In some instances, there may be no option but to admit the empty space is not going to work for retail or leisure, either in a town centre or in a worn-out shopping centre. That's when it's time to turn it into residential property.""It makes sense, because we've got too many shops and a lack of flats."" says Richard Lim of Retail Economics.The British Property Federation's chief executive, Melanie Leech, agrees: ""We think there's a huge opportunity from the empty retail outlets.""We have a huge shortage of residential stock and we know people increasingly want to live in towns and cities.""Of course, some retailers are still expanding and looking for new space. Leading the charge are discounters Aldi and Lidl, whose popularity is surging.The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) reckons that by 2022, one of every £7 spent on groceries will go to the discounters, with the total value of their sales jumping by nearly 50% between 2017 and 2022 to about £30bn.Lidl has more than 700 stores in the UK and plans to open 50 this year alone, while Aldi has more than 750 stores and will open 70 this year.Convenience stores run by the big supermarket chains are also springing up in many neighbourhood locations as more and more people abandon the weekly shop and leave decisions about an evening meal to the last minute.As a result, the IGD expects convenience store sales to rise by nearly 18% to about £47bn by 2022."
business	Asda Sainsbury's merger talks 'sign of changing retail world'		"Could the big four become the big three? It's a question many had been asking given how the grocery landscape has been changing.All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles.Not least because discounters like Aldi and Lidl have been hugely disruptive, stealing customers and eating into their market share.And then looming on the horizon is the mighty Amazon and its desire for a bigger slice of the grocery pie. It's already squeezing them in non food.Tesco shook the industry by buying Booker, Britain's biggest wholesaler, to tap into the growing ""out of home"" food market, where people are eating out or buying prepared food to eat at home or on the go.It would also give Tesco even greater scale and buying power with suppliers.Morrisons has done a tie-up with Amazon to supply the online retailer with hundreds of products. It has also done a deal to supply McColls, the convenience store chain.And then, of course, Sainsbury's bought Argos, giving it a £6bn general merchandise business at a stroke.That left Asda. Owned by Walmart of the US, it had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know.Combining the two businesses will greatly increase their bargaining clout, providing better economies of scale, although the two brands will remain.If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004.But will it pass the competition authorities?Asda's former boss, Andy Clarke, told me last year that the CMA's ruling on the Tesco/Booker deal meant it was ""open season"" for further deals in the sector.But this planned merger will get plenty of scrutiny, for sure.This is perhaps the starkest sign yet of how fast the retail world is changing."
business	Japan 'glasses ban' for women at work sparks backlash		"Wearing glasses at work has become an emotive topic in Japan following reports that some firms have told female employees to remove them.Several local news outlets said some companies had ""banned"" eyewear for female employees for various reasons.Among them, some retail chains reportedly said glasses-wearing shop assistants gave a ""cold impression"".That has sparked heated discussion on Japanese social media over dress practices and women in the workplace.The Nippon TV network and Business Insider were among the outlets to report on the issue, which looked at how firms in different industries prohibit women from wearing glasses.They included safety reasons for airline workers, or being unable to see make-up properly for women working in the beauty sector.It was not clear whether the so-called ""bans"" were based on company policies, or rather reflected what was socially accepted practice in those workplaces.But the topic has led to heated debates on social media.The hashtag ""glasses are forbidden"" has been popular in Japan and the topic continued to attract tweets on Friday.Kumiko Nemoto, professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies, said people in Japan were reacting to the ""outdated"" policies.She said: ""The reasons why women are not supposed to wear glasses... really don't make sense. It's all about gender. It's pretty discriminatory.""She added that the reports reflected ""old, traditional Japanese"" thinking.""It's not about how women do their work. The company... values the women's appearance as being feminine and that's opposite to someone who wears glasses,"" Prof Nemoto said.The discussion has echoes of a recent workplace controversy in Japan over high heels.Actor and writer Yumi Ishikawa launched a petition calling for Japan to end dress codes after being made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour.The movement attracted a stream of support and a strong social media following.Supporters tweeted the petition alongside the hashtag #KuToo in solidarity with her cause, mirroring the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse.The slogan plays on the Japanese words for shoes ""kutsu"" and pain ""kutsuu"".Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs.Supporters were further aggravated after a Japanese minister said it is ""necessary"" for companies to enforce dress codes that mandated high heels.Prof Nemoto said there continues to be discussion by women in Japan ""criticising the high heel"" policies.""Women are evaluated mostly on their appearance,"" she said. ""That's the message that these policies are sending, at least.""Have you ever been told what to wear or not to wear at work?

business	Supercuts calls in administrators risking 1,200 jobs		"The owner of the Supercuts and Regis hairdressing chains, Regis UK, has appointed administrators, putting 1,200 jobs at risk.Accountants Deloitte have been called in to look for options for the 220-salon business.The salons will remain open while a buyer is sought for the business.Deloitte said changes in consumer behaviour had led to lower footfall in shopping centres where many of the salons are located.""The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Regis UK Limited had been seeking to address this through a restructuring of its business,"" said Rob Harding, joint administrator.Last year, Regis UK negotiated a cut in the rent it paid through a legal process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), but landlords challenged the proposals in court.Increasing numbers of retailers have sought CVAs in an attempt to spread the impact of the downturn, as consumers shift from the High Street to online shopping. CVAs allow companies to seek rent reductions and new debt repayment terms, but are meeting increasing opposition from landlords.Regis said at the time that a ""perfect storm"" of factors, including falling customer numbers and higher wages, had hurt the business.Deloitte said the chains would continue trading while options for the business were explored.""The group operates two very strong brands and we are working with all key stakeholders to stabilise the situation and provide the best solution possible,"" said Mr Harding."
business	UK retail sales slide in tough December	Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent	"UK retail sales fell by 1.5% in December compared with November, the biggest monthly fall since the EU referendum, official figures show.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said many shoppers had shifted spending to November to take advantage of Black Friday offers.It comes as Carpetright and clothing chain Bonmarche were the latest retailers to report a tough Christmas.A squeeze on consumer spending also led to a difficult December for UK shops.Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser, and Mothercare were among the other High Street retailers which reported a decline in sales.Inflation has been outstripping increases in wages, denting the spending power of shoppers.For 2017 as a whole, the quantity bought increased by 1.9%, which was the lowest annual growth since 2013.This picture was underlined on Friday when trading updates from Carpetright and clothing chain Bonmarche unsettled investors enough to prompt big share price falls.Carpetright issued a profit warning amid a ""sharp deterioration"" in UK trade, sending its shares down by almost a half.Bonmarche shares sank by a quarter after it said like-for-like sales at its stores dropped nearly 10% in the last three months of 2017.It's always tricky looking at one month's set of retail figures. Although December saw a bigger than expected dip than the previous month, it's been clear for some time that the pattern of Christmas spending is changing.Black Friday has been hugely disruptive, bringing forward consumer spending that would otherwise have taken place in the traditional month of December. So that's had a knock-on effect on today's figures.The British Retail Consortium's recent figures posted a bit of month-on-month growth but for a clearer sense of the underlying trend, you need to look at retail sales over a longer period.Perhaps the most interesting statistic in today's data is the slowing growth between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the previous one. In other words, a disappointing end to a tough year for retailers.The ONS said that the trend towards online spending was continuing, and that almost one in five pounds was now spent online.It also predicted that retail sales would contribute almost nothing to economic growth in the last three months of 2017.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The data add to signs that rising prices and stubbornly weak pay growth continue to erode consumer spending power and will act as a drag on the economy in 2018.""The 1.5% monthly decline in retail sales volume in December was the biggest since June 2016, according to the ONS.Ben Brettell, senior economist, at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that year-on-year retail sales rose by 1.4% in December, but that was lower than the 3% jump predicted by analysts.""But there could be some light at the end of the tunnel,"" he added, amid signs that wage growth is picking up and inflation may have peaked."
business	Asda workers are 'terrified for their jobs'	'Inflexible' termsShorter notice'Understand concerns'	"Asda staff have spoken of being ""terrified"" of losing their jobs after the supermarket giant put pressure on them to sign new contracts.Runcorn store employee Cath Sutton, who has yet to sign, said Asda should be ashamed of the stress it is causing.The contracts mean unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice.But as the Saturday deadline neared, Asda softened its stance, saying it did not want staff to leave and regret it.""Once the closing date has passed, we will write to them again, offering them the opportunity to sign up,"" said the letter from chief executive Roger Burnley.The letter added: ""We do not want anyone to leave because of the new contract.""Fewer than 1,000 staff have yet to sign the new contract and its terms bring the company into line with rivals, Asda says.Most of the 100,000 staff affected will be better off, the letter added.The GMB union said many staff felt they could not sign the ""inflexible"" terms because of disruption to domestic life, while the impact would fall heavily on female employees.""If I sign it, it will affect me because they can move me into any department,"" Ms Sutton, 76, who has worked for Asda for 45 years, told the Today programme.""They can move me on to the shop floor, carrying heavy boxes, filling the shelves.""""They could change my hours any time from five in the morning to 12 at night.""""I think at my age, why would I be able to start going to different departments and doing different jobs?""There are plenty of Asda workers who are similarly worried, she says, but are feeling pressured into agreeing the new terms.""I think the company should be thoroughly, thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It's caused a hell of a lot of stress for people.""""They are having to sign out of desperation because they are terrified of losing their jobs.""Under the changes, paid breaks will be scrapped, working bank holidays will become compulsory - although festive holidays will be voluntary and paid at double time - and there will be changes to night shift payments.Neil Derrick, GMB regional officer for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, said staff would also be forced to attend work at shorter notice, disrupting the life of carers or people doing the school run.Leeds-based Asda is increasing hourly pay rates. However, Mr Derrick said it was not the money that mattered for many staff, but the inflexibility of the new working patterns.""Many staff cannot sign because of upheaval to their domestic life. Others have signed just to get them through Christmas or until they can find new jobs,"" he said.""I've not met anyone who thinks they will be better off in terms of working life. There will be a disproportionate impact on women.""Mr Derrick said the union would support sacked employees in any legal battle against Asda. Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he ""stands in solidarity"" with Asda workers.This week, Asda announced it would increase employees' basic hourly pay from April, a move that the GMB said shows the supermarket is desperate to woo over disgruntled staff before the deadline.The supermarket said it would raise its basic rate for its hourly-paid retail employees to £9.18 from 1 April next year, following an increase to £9 from 3 November.In London, which has an additional allowance to reflect the higher cost of living, basic pay will increase to £10.31 per hour.The retailer, owned by Walmart, acknowledged this week's annual pay announcement for April rises had come earlier that usual.An Asda spokesman said the new contract ""represents an investment of over £80m and an increase in real pay for over 100,000 of our hourly paid colleagues"".He added: ""We have been clear that we don't want any of our colleagues to leave us and whilst the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try and understand their concerns.""While Asda accepted that change was ""never easy"", it was important that the company adapted to changes in the market and competition, he said.The company has won backing from former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King, who used to work at Asda.He told the BBC that the new retail environment, where the working practices of some online retailers were ""almost Victorian"", had made life extremely competitive for traditional firms.""All legacy retailers - and Asda are one - have some legacy arrangements with their workforce which simply don't reflect the modern world that we're in.""Many online retailers don't pay their workers anywhere near as well as the mainstream retailers,"" he said.To compete, it was necessary to take tough decisions. ""Sometimes you have to do the right thing for the whole business."""
business	US retail giants ask Trump to reconsider China tariffs	What is behind the tariffs?What are US retailers upset about?How can the US do this?Who else is alarmed?	"A group of US retail giants including Walmart, Target and Costco has asked US President Donald Trump to reconsider imposing tariffs against China, saying they could hurt American families.The US is preparing to slap annual tariffs worth up to $60bn (£42.7bn) on Chinese imports, according to reports.The potential tariffs would be against Chinese consumer products, telecommunications and technology.Some tariff measures could be unveiled as soon as Friday, reports have said.The group of US retailers wrote to Mr Trump on Monday urging him to carefully consider the impact the tariffs would have on consumer prices and American families.The letter was organised by the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) and is signed by 25 retail giants.""This is not American industries crying wolf,"" Sandy Kennedy, president of RILA said in a statement.""Higher tariffs will mean higher costs to businesses and in turn higher prices for American families,"" she said.""We must do right by American families, and make sure they are not the ones who will pay for China's harmful technology practices.""Mr Trump argues the massive US trade deficit with China is due, in part, to Chinese firms copying US products and ideas, and either selling them back to the US at a lower price or squeezing US imports out of the Chinese market.Also, some US firms are upset about rules that require local partnerships or disclosure of intellectual property to enter the Chinese market, which they say facilitates transfer of their ideas.So, in August, Mr Trump asked his country's top trade official to review China's practices regarding intellectual property.Any tariffs by the US would be in retaliation to what it sees as unfair Chinese practices and is allowed under section 301 of the country's trade act.The tariffs could affect a list of as many as 100 products including shoes and footwear, but would be chiefly be targeted at IT, consumer electronics and other products that benefit from US intellectual property, according to Reuters.US retailers group said they support holding trading partners accountable, but that tariffs against China would see American households pay higher prices for goods.They also said tariffs would ""exacerbate a US tariff system that is already stacked against working families"".""Families shopping in our stores pay higher prices because America already levies import taxes as much as 32% and 67% on basic clothes and shoes,"" their letter to the President said.""Applying any additional broad-based tariff as part of a Section 301 action would worsen this inequity and punish American working families with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes, electronics, and home goods.""Under section 301 of the trade act, the government has given itself the power to unilaterally impose sanctions against countries which it decides are not trading fairly.There is some debate around whether Mr Trump will announce further tariffs, but if he does, the action would not need approval from US Congress.China meanwhile has said there would be no winner from any trade war.On Tuesday, the last day of the annual sitting of the National People's Congress, China's Premier Le Keqiang said he hoped both sides could remain ""calm"".He also said he hoped the US would ease restrictions on exports of high-tech goods to China.On Sunday, 45 US trade groups also sent a letter to Mr Trump urging him to reconsider the potential tariffs, saying they would be particularly harmful.""We urge the administration not to impose tariffs and to work with the business community to find an effective, but measured, solution to China's protectionist trade policies and practices that protects American jobs and competitiveness,"" the groups said.Earlier this month, Mr Trump imposed heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium. He said the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"" and the move would boost US industry.From next week, tariffs of 25% are to be placed on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US, however they include exemptions for Canada and Mexico."
business	Retail sales 'fall off a cliff' as Easter timing hits spending		"UK retail sales fell ""off a cliff"" in April, although the figures were distorted by the timing of Easter.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings, fell by 4.2% compared with April 2017.Total sales were 3.1% down year-on-year, the sharpest fall since the BRC started collecting data 23 years ago.While a lot of Easter spending was done in late March, not April, the figures were still worrying, the BRC said.The industry body has been publishing its monthly BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor since January 1995.Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive said: ""A drop in sales this April... was almost inevitable given the earlier timing of Easter. With much of the spending in preparation for the Bank Holiday weekend falling in March this year, a record low in sales growth, in contrast to last year's record high, does not come as a surprise.""However, even once we take account of these seasonal distortions, the underlying trend in sales growth is heading downwards,"" she said.Fashion sales rose, according to the data, but food and grocery fell. Ms Dickinson said: ""The first glimpse of summer may have temporarily lifted clothing and footwear, but non-food sales overall continue to be weak.""Consumers' discretionary spending power remains under pressure and the reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.""Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the figures underline why retailers are struggling and several have announced closures and restructurings.""Consumers' propensity to spend remains weak with households cutting back on discretionary purchases,"" Mr Lim said. ""Clearly, all is not well on the High Street and challenging conditions look set to remain for the rest of the year."""
business	Retail shares drag down FTSE 100		"Shares in Next fell 9.1% in Wednesday trade after the fashion retailer issued a cautious trading update.Next said third-quarter trading had been ""extremely volatile"", adding that this volatility made it hard to determine any underlying sales trend.Online sales growth at Next's Directory business continued to offset falling sales on the High Street, with sales up 1.3% overall in the quarter.Overall, the benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 5.12 points to close at 7,487.96.Shares in rival retailers were also hit by Next's update, with M&S down 4.5%.Primark owner Associated British Foods dropped 2.1%, while Debenhams fell 4%.Away from the retail sector, shares in Standard Chartered bank dropped 6% after its third quarter revenue growth of 4% fell short of expectations.Paddy Power Betfair was the biggest riser in the index, climbing 4.5%, after it reported higher third-quarter revenues and made a small increase to its full-year earnings forecast.Revenues in the three months to 30 September rose 9% to £440m, and it now expects underlying earnings to be between £450m and £465m.On the currency markets, the pound was 0.16% down against the dollar at $1.3262, but was 0.05% higher against the euro at €1.1411."
business	Philip Green's Topshop empire plunges to huge loss	'Challenging year''Changed forever'	"Sir Philip Green's Topshop retailing empire plunged to a loss last year, blaming a ""dramatically"" changed retail landscape and increased competition.The business, which also includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, has since agreed a rescue deal with its creditors that triggered 48 store closures.The results for the year to 1 September 2018 show a loss of £169.2m compared with a £49.4m profit a year earlier.It also warned it may need fresh funds.The rescue deal, agreed in June, involved the landlords to the chains of stores backing a number of company voluntary arrangements (CVA), allowing the business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts.In an update provided in the latest results, the directors say are they ""confident that we will deliver on our plan, improve the way we work and win the hearts and minds of more and more of our customers"".The results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina.The company said a 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by ""the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers"".If exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of £78.1m, down from £124.1m a year earlier.Taveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell.""After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,"" it added.In a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a ""portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands"".The results highlight the importance of refinancing a £310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December.If that does not happen, the company said ""the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt"".The directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They say the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans.However, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the ""on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector"" could force the business to seek fresh financing.On a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is £177m compared with profits of £53.5m a year earlier.Results for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of £93m compared with £164m in the previous year.In June, Sir Philip acknowledged to the BBC that the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react.""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job,"" he told the BBC in June.The business has not been alone in finding the going tough on the High Street.Earlier this year, Britain's biggest department store chain Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders as part of an administration process, while House of Fraser was sold to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct last year.Marks and Spencer has also illustrated the woes facing traditional retailers, falling out of the FTSE 100 index this week amid competition from firms such as Primark on the High Street and Boohoo online."
business	Salmonella scare sparks hummus recall		"A salmonella scare has sparked the recall of hummus stocked in a wide range of supermarkets.The recall is for 17 products at chains such as Aldi, Morrisons, Lidl, Asda and Sainsbury's. It also applies to a Nando's branded product.The products have use-by dates ranging from 31 October to 7 November.The Food Standards Agency said: ""Zorba Delicacies Limited is recalling various brands and flavours of hummus because the products may contain salmonella.""A spokesman for Zorba Delicacies said salmonella had been found in a ""limited volume"" of hummus and said this was the first product recall for salmonella in its 15 years of operation.The FSA said that symptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.Discount retailer Aldi was among the chains to tweet about the issue on Thursday.""We have recalled this product due to it not meeting our high quality standards. Customers should return the product to their nearest store, where they will receive a full refund. We apologise for any inconvenience,"" Aldi said.A spokesman for Zorba Delicacies said: ""The company maintains thorough procedures for the sourcing, use and testing of all products including independent laboratory testing. The frequency of product testing goes way beyond the minimum standards set for the industry.""The issue was identified during our testing procedure and root cause analysis has quickly pinpointed the likely source as being from a batch of ingredient supplied by a third party.""The company said it had immediately told the FSA about the matter. It said none of its other products were affected, and subsequent production has not identified any issues.The FSA issued information about the recall on 29 October.""Point of sale notices will be displayed in all retail stores that are selling these products. These notices explain to customers why the products are being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the product,"" the FSA said.Two years ago, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer withdrew parts of their hummus ranges from stores because of a ""production issue"".At the time, it led to social media hysteria over the Middle Eastern dip.Britain consumes about 12,000 tonnes a year of the dip, which is usually made of cooked and mashed chick peas, tahini (sesame paste), lemon and garlic."
business	Asda's contract changes are 'just not fair'	'Highly competitive industry'	"Cathy Murphy has worked for Asda for the last 44 years and says it has been an ""absolutely amazing employer"".However, recently the supermarket chain told Ms Murphy she will be fired unless she signs up to a new contract that will strip her of her long-service benefits, paid tea breaks and Bank Holidays off.She is one of thousands of employees who have been told to sign the new contract before 2 November or leave the business. But Ms Murphy describes it as ""just not fair"".The GMB union says up to 12,000 workers face a choice between signing the new contracts - which increase wages to £9 an hour but scrap many other perks - or being sacked in the run up to Christmas.But Asda told the BBC: ""This contract is an investment of more than £80m and increases real pay for over 100,000 colleagues.""Despite this, Ms Murphy worries for night shift staff who will have their pay cut, as well as people with caring responsibilities who may struggle with the new contracts.Ms Murphy works in the fruit and vegetable section at Asda's Parkhead Forge store in Glasgow.As a union representative, she has been aware of the contract changes since the spring. However, her colleagues at the store only found out through meetings with managers over the summer.Workers were given a document, which said they would have private meetings - or one-to-ones (121s) - with management.""As part of the 121 process we hope that you agree to move to the new contract,"" Asda said in the document. ""If you still don't want to sign up to the new contract at your final 121 we will issue you notice to terminate your employment.""It said staff who had not signed the new contract would ""leave the business"" at the end of their notice period.Then, earlier this month, Asda bosses handed out a leaflet with tips on getting a new job.It suggested staff use their local job centre, get an email address and offered advice on CV writing. Ms Murphy called the leaflets ""condescending"".It is not the first time that Asda has tried to move staff onto flexible contracts.In 2017, the supermarket chain offered workers a salary increase in exchange for voluntarily switching to a new contract that introduced unpaid breaks and a requirement to work over Bank Holidays.But over the summer, those changes were made compulsory.The GMB union has written to the supermarket chain, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, asking it to delay the introduction of the new contracts.""On November 2nd, we understand up to 12,000 of your loyal Asda workers will be given the sack - just before Christmas,"" it said in a letter sent over the weekend. ""That can not be right.""But Asda says the vast majority of staff have signed up to the new contract.""We have been clear that we don't want any of our colleagues to leave us,"" a spokesman said, explaining that the changes would help the chain ""adapt to the demands of the highly competitive retail industry"".Ms Murphy thinks the chain will go through with its threat to fire the rest but she says it is unfair after giving more than four decades to the supermarket chain.""I'm coming to the end of my working life,"" she says. ""And for this to happen [now], it's just not fair.""It's not fair at all."""
business	Retail sales growth boosted by clothing	'Resilience'	"UK retail sales grew by 1% in August compared with the previous month, with sales of clothing and non-essential items reported as strong.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said that compared with last August, sales volumes were 2.4% higher.It was the 52nd month in a row that sales have risen.The ONS also said that prices for non-food sales had risen at their fastest rate in 15 years. It added the underlying pattern was of growth.The figures add to evidence of rising inflation which has been fuelled, in part, by the drop in the pound's value since the Brexit vote.Last week, the Bank of England said this was likely to peak at 3% from its August figure of 2.9%.The bank said it was likely to raise interest rates if inflation and the economy continued to remain strong.The figures show higher prices had failed to stop consumer spending, despite the squeeze on wages, which have not been rising as fast as inflation.Official figures last week showed wages in the three months to July were 0.4% lower in real terms than in 2016.The ONS said: ""Year-on-year contribution of food stores remains flat, while there was a fall in the contribution of growth within petrol stations, showing that contributions to the overall growth came from non-essential items.""Retail prices increased across all store types on the year, with non-food stores and non-store retailing recording their highest year-on-year price growth since March 1992, at 3.2% and 3.3% respectively.Ben Brettell, senior economist, at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the willingness of consumers to spend was surprising: ""The UK consumer continues to show remarkable resilience, with retail sales in August blowing economists' forecasts out of the water.""Spending has defied expectations of a slowdown since the Brexit referendum, and currently seems to be holding up despite weak wage growth and above-target inflation.""This could bode well for economic growth - the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer, and economists had expected falling real incomes to eventually translate into weak retail sales. If this fails to materialise, the economy could see a stronger second half to the year."""
business	The £7,500 dress that does not exist	Digital collection	"Earlier this year Richard Ma, the chief executive of San Francisco-based security company Quantstamp, spent $9,500 (£7,500) on a dress for his wife.That is a lot of money for a dress, particularly when it does not exist, at least not in a physical form.Instead it was a digital dress, designed by fashion house The Fabricant, rendered on to an image of Richard's wife, Mary Ren, which can then be used on social media.""It's definitely very expensive, but it's also like an investment,"" Mr Ma says.He explains that he and his wife don't usually buy expensive clothing, but he wanted this piece because he thinks it has long-term value.""In 10 years time everybody will be 'wearing' digital fashion. It's a unique memento. It's a sign of the times.""Ms Ren has shared the image on her personal Facebook page, and via WeChat, but opted not to post it on a more public platform.Another fashion house designing for the digital space is Carlings. The Scandinavian company released a digital street wear collection, starting at around £9 ($11), last October.It ""sold out"" within a month.""It sounds kinda stupid to say we 'sold out', which is theoretically impossible when you work with a digital collection because you can create as many as you want,"" explains Ronny Mikalsen, Carlings' brand director.""We had set a limit on the amount of products we were going to produce to make it a bit more special.Being digital-only allows designers to create items that can push boundaries of extravagance or possibilities.""You wouldn't buy a white t-shirt digitally, right? Because it makes no sense showing it off. So it has to be something that you really either want to show off, or an item that you wouldn't dare to buy physically, or you couldn't afford to buy physically.""Carlings' digital collection was produced as part of a marketing campaign for their real, physical products. But the firm thinks the concept has potential - a second line of digital garments is planned for late 2019.The Fabricant releases new, free digital clothes on its website every month, but consumers need the skills, and software, to blend the items with their own pictures.This also means the company has to find another way to make money until digital fashion becomes more popular.More Technology of Business""We make our money by servicing fashion brands and retailers with their marketing needs, selling tools, and creating content that uses that aesthetic language of digital fashion,"" says The Fabricant founder Kerry Murphy.It is not entirely clear who is buying the digital garments from Carlings, or downloading clothes from The Fabricant.Mr Mikalsen says Carlings has sold between 200-250 digital pieces, but a search to find them on Instagram only resulted in four people who independently purchased from the collection and had no involvement with the company.However, some of the those clothes might have only been shared privately.Amber Jae Slooten, a co-founder and designer at The Fabricant, concedes it is mainly industry professionals, who use the CLO 3D software, that are downloading their clothes.""But it's also just people are very curious to see what the files look like. People just want to own the thing, especially since that one dress sold for $9,500.""Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at market research company NPD Group, calls the emergence of digital fashion an ""amazing phenomenon"", but is yet to be convinced about its long-term impact.""Do I believe it's going to be something huge and stay forever? No.""He says the technology works for people who want the perfect image. ""If you don't like what you're wearing, but you love where you are, you now have the ability to transition your wardrobe, and digitally enhance the photograph to make it look like you're wearing the latest and greatest.""Players of computer games have long been willing to spend money on outfits, or skins, for their in-game characters. That partly inspired The Fabricant to work in the digital space.""The only reason we made the collection the way we did - inspired from Fortnite - was because of the whole link between buying skins and buying digital clothing,"" Mr Mikalsen says.""When it comes to technology and the way people are living their lives, we have to be aware of that the world is changing.""Designers working on skins for games face extra challenges - they have to make sure it fits the story and the character.Once the outfit is designed, which can take one try or 70, the hardest part starts according to in-games cosmetics consultant Janelle Jimenez.The skins have to work in the game - a medium that, unlike digital fashion, often involves movements such as walking, fighting or dancing.""For a game like League of Legends, you have to do 3D, there's sound effects, there's animations, all of these things have to come together to make the character feel like they're sort of expressing a different fantasy of themselves.""It's less like changing clothes and more like seeing an actor playing a different role.""The influence of games and shifts in customer tastes gives some in the fashion industry confidence that digital clothes, in some capacity, will have long-term impact.""Digital fashion will become an important part of every fashion business' future business model,"" says head of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion, Matthew Drinkwater.""It's not going to replace everything, but it will be an important part of that."""
business	Black Friday lifts UK retail sales in November		"Black Friday helped to propel retail sales 1.6% higher in November from a year earlier, official figures suggest.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that retailers had reported a particular uplift in sales of electrical household appliances.ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said underlying growth remained ""reasonably strong"".However, analysts said that Black Friday had distorted sales and retailers faced challenging conditions.The ONS said that the quantity of food bought in November fell by 0.1% compared to the same month last year.However, the amount of money spent jumped by 3.5%, reflecting a rise in food prices that has contributed to the increase in inflation, which is now at a near six-year high of 3.1%.In non-food sales, clothing and footwear rebounded from a slump in October to rise 2.3% in November from a year earlier. Department stores, however, saw their sales fall by 0.9% which the ONS said ""continues a recent pattern of slowdown in this sector"".Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, said: ""The final run up to Christmas may prove more difficult than usual for retailers as they battle low consumer confidence amid increasing inflation and a squeeze on wages.""Black Friday is an import from the US, where it takes place on the day after Thanksgiving and is regarded as the start of the Christmas shopping period.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The surge in retail sales in November does not signal broader consumer strength.""Mr Tombs said Black Friday meant the strength in November retail sales ""merely reflected people bringing forward purchases that they otherwise would have made in December or January to November, due to the discounts available"".Month-on-month, sales rose by 1.1% in November from October, which was ahead of analysts' forecasts for 0.4% growth.Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said that ""on the surface"" the data was ""promising"".But he said: ""The next 10 days of pre-Christmas sales will be crucial for retailers. Trading is likely to peak on Friday 22 December, particularly for purchases of food and drink as consumers prepare for festive hosting.""However, profitability is another matter and margins are under intense pressure."""
business	UK retail sales show weak growth despite gym wear boost	'Terrible start'	"Retail sales saw only a slight pick-up in January as rising prices continued to dampen shoppers' spending.UK sales volumes rose by just 0.1% in January from the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said.Sports equipment saw stronger sales than usual, the ONS said, as shoppers set out to meet New Year's resolutions to get fit, but food sales fell.The ONS said the longer-term picture showed ""a continued slowdown"" in the retail sector.Inflation has been running at a higher rate than increases in earnings, eroding consumers' spending power.Sales volumes in January were up 1.6% when compared with a year earlier, the ONS said. That was the highest year-on-year rate since August, but was below analysts' expectations.""Retail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the New Year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices,"" said ONS senior statistician Rhian Murphy.Many traditional High Street stores have been struggling recently as they battle for shoppers' custom in the face of growing competition from online retailers.Last week, Debenhams said it was cutting 320 store management jobs as it stepped up cost-cutting plans in the wake of a profit warning that was triggered by disappointing Christmas trading.Supermarkets are also keeping a sharp eye on costs. Three of the UK's biggest supermarket chains - Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - have announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, including stripping out layers of middle management.""Following a wave of profit warning and job cut announcements, these figures confirm a terrible start to the year for retailers. Indeed, the worst January since 2013,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics.""In part, inflation has proved stickier than expected, remaining at uncomfortably high levels for many households. As spending on essentials eats into personal finances, consumers have continued to cut back on discretionary spending elsewhere.""However, Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there ""could be some light at the end of the tunnel"".""The Bank of England says wage growth is on an upward trajectory, while inflation may well have peaked,"" he said.""This means we could see an end to falling real wages in the coming months, which would provide a welcome fillip to cash-strapped households."""

business	John Lewis seeks discounts from some landlords	'Distorted market	"John Lewis is seeking discounts from its landlords to cut costs, in a highly unusual move that highlights the huge pressures on retailers.The BBC has learned that the retail giant has been telling landlords in some locations that it will withhold 20% of this quarter's service charge.These are the fees retailers pay on top of rent for services such as heating and security.John Lewis said the charges had become too high and urged landlords to help.But the move could lead to legal action by property owners to recover any unpaid money.John Lewis Partnership announced a major restructuring of its management teams earlier this week in a bid to cut £100m a year from its costs. From next year its supermarkets and department store divisions will be run as one business.But it's also clearly trying to make savings across its portfolio of stores as well.""This was done without any consultation,"" one landlord told the BBC.""Every landlord will be looking at their lease, talking to lawyers who will get revved up to recover this money as a debt,"" he added.A service charge is a sum due under the terms of a lease between a landlord and tenant, towards the costs incurred in providing a range of services for the operation of a building's common parts.That could include cleaning, security, maintenance, marketing, heating/cooling and staffing. Tenants are then charged on an apportioned basis relating to the size of the space occupied with larger stores getting a significant weighted discount.John Lewis has around 20 stores in covered shopping centres.It's understood that it wants mainly these landlords to shoulder some of the service charge during the so called ""golden quarter"" - the fourth quarter that includes Christmas. In September, the group posted its first ever loss for the first half of this year.In a statement John Lewis said: ""At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres.""Over the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs.""We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this,"" it added.But John Lewis is under contract to meet its service charge obligations and withholding a big chunk of it could put it in direct conflict with some of its property owners.""John Lewis is in a much better place than most of its rivals but its revenues are under enormous pressure right now,"" said another landlord.""What they're up to, I think, is trying to open up a broader conversation about property costs more generally. The market is distorted right now. The stronger retailers are pretty concerned about this uneven playing field,"" he added.Debenhams has managed to slash its rent bill with reductions of up to 50% after securing a restructuring deal with its creditors. Struggling retailers have been turning to these so-called company voluntary arrangements as a way to cut costs.House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct and many of these stores are currently paying little if any rent.John Lewis is one of Britain's stronger retail chains and has a reputation for plain dealing. This particular cost-cutting measure, if it succeeds, will be controversial for the already beleaguered retail property industry. The group's biggest landlords include Hammerson and Intu.""I am astounded to hear this from a company which sets the gold standard in retail,"" one seasoned property expert told the BBC.""There's nothing new in retailers trying to challenge the specifics of a service charge. But to seek to withhold money like this is in breach of a contract. This is going to go down like a lead balloon.""Landlords are already grappling with falling rents and property values. Now they may have something else to worry about if other retailers follow suit."
business	Xinjiang cotton sparks concern over 'forced labour' claims	What is happening in Xinjiang?What is produced in Xinjiang?Which brands use Xinjiang cotton?	"Global retailers are facing scrutiny over cotton supplies sourced from Xinjiang, a Chinese region plagued by allegations of human rights abuses.China is one of the world's top cotton producers and most of its crop is grown in Xinjiang.Rights groups say Xinjiang's Uighur minority are being persecuted and recruited for forced labour.Many brands are thought to indirectly source cotton products from the Xinjiang region in China's far west.Japanese retailers Muji and Uniqlo attracted attention recently after a report highlighted the brands used the Xinjiang-origin of their cotton as a selling point in advertisements.H&M, Esprit and Adidas are among the firms said to be at the end of supply chains involving cotton products from Xinjiang, according to a Wall Street Journal investigation.""You can't be sure that you don't have coerced labour in your supply chain if you do cotton business in China,"" said Nathan Ruser, researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.""Xinjiang labour and what is almost certainly coerced labour is very deeply entrenched into the supply chain that exists in Xinjiang.""UN experts and human rights groups say China is holding more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps.Rights groups also say people in camps are made to learn Mandarin Chinese, swear loyalty to President Xi Jinping, and criticise or renounce their faith.China says those people are attending ""vocational training centres"" which are giving them jobs and helping them integrate into Chinese society, in the name of preventing terrorism.The Xinjiang region is a key hub of Chinese cotton production.China produces about 22% of global cotton supplies, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Last year, 84% of Chinese cotton came from Xinjiang, the report said.That has raised concerns over whether forced labour has been used in the production of cotton from the region.Nury Turkel, chairman of the Uighur Human Rights Project in Washington, said the Uighurs were being ""detained and tormented"" and ""swept into a vast system of forced labor"" in Xinjiang.In testimony to US congress, he said it was becoming ""increasingly hard to ignore the fact"" that the goods manufactured in the region have ""a high likelihood"" of being produced with forced labour.Amy Lehr, director of CSIS Human Rights Initiative, said in many cases Western companies aren't buying directly from factories in Xinjiang.""Rather, the products may go through several stages of transformation after leaving Xinjiang before they are sent to large Western brands,"" she said.Some, like Muji, are very open about sourcing material from Xinjiang.The Japanese retail chain launched a new Xinjiang Cotton collection earlier this year.One of its advertisements boasts ""soft and breathable"" men's shirts made from organic cotton ""delicately and wholly handpicked in Xinjiang"".Another Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo had also touted the Xinjiang region in an advertisement advertisment for men's shirts.In the fine print of the shirt description, the advert said the shirts were made from Xinjiang cotton, ""famous for its superb quality"".That reference was later removed from the advertisement ""given the complexity of this issue"", according to a spokesperson for Uniqlo.""Uniqlo does not have any production partners located in the Xinjiang region. Moreover, Uniqlo production partners must commit to our strict company code of conduct.""To the best of our knowledge, this means our cotton comes only from ethical sources,"" the spokesperson told the BBC.According to the Wall Street Journal report which focused on workers at a mill operated by Huafu Fashion in Aksu, Xinjiang, yarn made in the region was present in the supply chains of several international retailers including H&M, Esprit and Adidas.Many of the companies looked into the allegations, including those without clear links to the Huafu mill.In a statement to the BBC, Adidas said: ""While we do not have a contractual relationship with Huafu Fashion Co., or any direct leverage with this business entity or its subsidiary, we are currently investigating these claims.""""We advised our material suppliers to place no orders with Huafu until we have completed those investigations,"" the Adidas spokesperson said.Esprit, which also does not source cotton directly from Xinjiang, said it had made several inquiries earlier this year.""We concluded that a very small amount of cotton from a Huafu factory in Xinjiang was used in a limited number of Esprit garments,"" the firm said in a statement.The company has instructed all suppliers to not source Huafu yarn from Aksu, the statement said.H&M said it does not have ""a direct or indirect business relationship"" with any garment manufacturer in the Xinjiang region.""We have an indirect business relationship with Huafu's spinning unit in Shanyu, which is not located in the Xinjiang region, and according to our data, the vast majority of the yarn used for our garment manufacturing comes from this spinning unit,"" a spokesperson for H&M said.""Since we have an indirect business relationship with the yarn supplier Huafu, we also asked for access to their spinning facilities in Aksu. Our investigations showed no evidence of forced labor."""

The ONS said food prices had risen by 3.5% and general retail prices by 3.1%.ONS statistician Kate Davies said: ""We are continuing to see an underlying picture of steady growth in retail sales, although this October suffered in comparison with a very strong October in 2016.""Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said there were a whole host of factors that had held back October sales, but the retail industry was likely to see a pick-up in November.""Unseasonably warm weather and Storms Brian and Ophelia coinciding with half-term saw some shoppers temporarily stay away from the High Street, impacting footfall and sales of non-food items - particularly new season clothing lines,"" she said.""We expect stronger retail sales in November, as many retailers have waited until after Halloween to kick start their Black Friday and Christmas campaigns."""
business	Eurozone retail sales boosted by clothing and food	Higher growth	"Eurozone retail sales grew in September, buoyed by sales of clothing, food and tobacco.Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, said retail sales in the region rose 0.7% month-on-month and 3.7% year-on-year.The figures eclipsed a 0.4% fall in car fuel sales in the month.The data indicates the area's economy is picking up amid stronger domestic demand. Economists expected less of an overall improvement.Eurostat attributed the increase in September retail sales to a rise of 0.5% for non-food products, which include clothing, furniture and electrical goods, and an advance of 1.3% for food, drinks and tobacco.Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg and France led the stronger retail volumes, while the UK, Croatia and Lithuania had the biggest decreases.Unofficial data showed sales of non-food items in the UK grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping. The British Retail Consortium said the figures would give retailers ""cause for concern"" in the run-up to Christmas.The European Central Bank in September raised its eurozone economic growth forecast for the year to 2.2%, the fastest pace in 10 years.The eurozone economy ended the third quarter of the year on a strong note, according to an IHS Markit survey released that month.The manufacturing sector observed the biggest rise in employment in over two decades, signalling that this quarter may also register strong manufacturing growth."
business	Hot weather boosts UK retail sales		"UK retail sales rose by more than expected in June, rebounding from May's decline, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting.The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes.That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks.""A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,"" ONS statistician Kate Davies said.Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year.Economists prefer to look at figures over three months, which smooth out volatile moves from month to month.""We shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis. And the heatwave in June provided a boost to clothing sales that may not be sustained,"" said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics.Other economists argue the figures should have been even stronger.""Last month was the fifth warmest June since 1910, and food and clothing sales usually surge when the temperature is unusually high in the summer,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""The increase in retail sales in June was relatively modest, given the temporary support to demand from the unusually warm weather.""Economists are keeping a close eye on spending by UK shoppers as it has been supporting the overall economy.But with inflation now running ahead of wage growth, there have been concerns of a slowdown in spending.""The outlook of falling real wages and tightening credit conditions suggest that retail sales will struggle to retain Q2's vigour in the second half of this year,"" Mr Tombs said.Next week, figures will be released on second quarter growth in the UK. Growth could ""perk-up"" from the first quarter figure of 0.2% according to Chris Williamson from IHS Markit.However, Mr Tombs from Capital Economics doubts there will be much improvement, given other weak economic data."
business	Amazon's arrival set to shake up Australia's retail sector	Lagging technologyRetail woes	"Amazon has made its long-awaited entry into Australia, in a move that could have ramifications for the country's A$300bn (£171bn) retail sector.Online shopping makes up a relatively small - but growing - proportion of retail sales in Australia.Geography, poor infrastructure and firms slow to adapt to e-commerce have held the sector back.Australia's retail industry association said Amazon would help local firms by providing a new sales platform.Australian consumers could previously buy through Amazon's US site. From Tuesday they can buy locally, as the American retail giant has established a huge distribution warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne on the country's east coast, home to most of the population.The move should cut shipping costs and delivery times for Australian shoppers.The arrival of Amazon has left some retailers bracing for a shake-up of the industry.Shares of traditional retailers like department store operator Myer Holdings and electronics firm JB HiFi have fallen sharply since Amazon confirmed plans to enter the market in April.Many of these companies have been slow to develop what retail analyst and chief executive of the Retail Doctor Group, Brian Walker, describes as an ""omni-channel offer"", linking their physical stores with websites and distribution channels.Online shopping makes up between 8% to 13% of total retail sales in Australia.Among the factors frustrating growth of the sector has been poor access to high-speed broadband in parts of the country.In the most recent State of the Internet survey, US internet firm Akami ranked Australia 50th in the world for internet speed.The country's largest infrastructure project - the $49bn rollout of the National Broadband Network - has been hamstrung by delays, policy shifts and cost overruuns.Australia's sheer land size coupled with low population density makes the logistics of retail delivery expensive. The country is the size of the mainland US, with one-thirteenth of its population.Mr Walker said Australia was ""not an easy country"" for e-commerce businesses.""It's geographically spread out [and] it's relatively expensive for shipping and freight.""The retail sector has seen other challenges.Bricks-and-mortar retailers have been struggling amid tough competition, and price discounts have failed to entice customers facing low wage growth and high levels of debt.Australian Retail Association executive director Russell Zimmerman said small businesses have seen rising costs and increased global competition, as well as the challenges of the ""24-hour market place"".But he believes Amazon's Marketplace - which has more than 300 million active users - could provide a lift to the Australia sector.The platform will offer ""millions"" of products from well-known Australian brands, as well as smaller local business selling on the Marketplace platform.""The majority of Australian retailers view Amazon's platform as a supplementary channel to their current retail offering,"" he said.Still, not all have been impressed with Amazon's first day's trade. Local media reported complaints of limited product range and uncompetitive prices."
business	UK retail sales growth continues in July	'Extraordinarily resilient'	"UK retail sales increased in July as stronger spending on food offset a fall in the purchase of other goods, according to official figures.The volume of sales grew by 0.3% compared with June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.However, the figure for June's retail sales growth was revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%.The latest data shows that the volume of food sales rose by 1.5% in July, having fallen by 1.1% in June.The ONS said all other sectors saw a fall in volume sales apart from household goods.Ole Black, ONS senior statistician, said that overall it was a ""relatively subdued picture"" in retail sales"".""Strong food sales have been responsible for the growth of 0.3% in July compared with June, as all other main sectors have shown a decrease. Whilst the overall growth is the same as in June, trends in growth in different sectors are proving quite volatile,"" he said.However, Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the July figures were ""fairly encouraging given the recent intensification of the squeeze on consumers' real incomes and suggest that talk of a sharp consumer slowdown has been overdone"".She said there had been few signs of a sharp slowdown in spending growth away from the high street.""What's more, with annual retail sales values growth remaining at a still strong 4.1% in July, this suggests that consumers haven't been tightening their belts as a result of Brexit uncertainty,"" she said.Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the figures showed the UK consumer was ""extraordinarily resilient"".""Spending has defied expectations of a slowdown since the Brexit referendum, and currently seems to be holding up despite weak wage growth and above-target inflation,"" he added.""This could bode well for economic growth - the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer, and economists had expected falling real incomes to eventually translate into weak retail sales.""However, the continuing difficulties for retailers was underlined on Thursday when Kingfisher reported a 1.9% fall in like-for-like sales for the three months to 31 July.The group's operations include DIY chain B&Q, whose sales fell 4.7%.PwC economic advisor, Andrew Sentance said the underlying picture on the High Street remained one of ""subdued growth"".""Consumers may also be becoming more cautious about spending because of the political uncertainty following the General Election and surrounding the Brexit process.""However, the main factor squeezing consumers is the weakness of the pound against other major currencies which is pushing up import prices and fuelling inflation,"" he added.""UK consumers are watching and waiting - for inflation to subside and for the post-Brexit to become clearer. Until there is some relief on these two key issues, subdued growth of retail sales looks set to continue through this year and into 2018."""
business	Amazon apparel announcement hits retail stocks		Tech stocks and retailers were among those posting losses on Tuesday, after e-commerce giant Amazon announced a new clothes shopping service.The fall weighed on US markets, as most sectors showed declines.The S&P 500 index fell 0.67% to 2,437.03 and the Dow Jones dipped 0.29% to 21,467.14.The Nasdaq index, which was buoyed by a tech rally on Monday, dropped 0.82% to 6,188.03.Amazon on Tuesday said it is testing a service that would allow customers to order boxes of clothes to try-on without paying upfront.It's a move aimed at eliminating one of the advantages of traditional stores. It also poses a threat to fashion start-ups already pioneering a similar business model.Shares in department stores, which were already struggling, fell further after the announcement. Kohl's stock slid 4%, Nordstrom dropped 3.95% and Macy's closed down 2.7%.Amazon shares also declined 0.3%, but that was more in keeping with market-wide trends.Biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms were among the few winners on Wall Street on Tuesday. The gains in share prices came as Washington looks to the White House to release a plan for grappling with the high costs of prescription drugs.Reports so far indicate the proposal hews closely to industry desires.
business	Rescue talks for retail supplier Palmer and Harvey	Tesco-Booker worry	"Talks over the future of major wholesaler Palmer and Harvey are being held with a number of parties.There have been reports for some weeks that P&H is struggling with debts and owes substantial sums to key suppliers.The BBC understands two cigarette firms, Imperial Brands and JTI, have extended loans to P&H while private equity firm Carlyle prepares a bid.P&H, Britain's main cigarette supplier, is the UK's fifth biggest privately-owned firm.It also delivers 12,000 products, including food and alcohol.It supplies about 90,000 outlets around the UK including major chains, convenience stores, corner shops and petrol station forecourts.P&H technically has until Saturday to secure its future, the date at which a number of credit lines are due to be repaid.Imperial Brands said earlier on Thursday it was working ""to create a sustainable future"" for the company.In its statement, Imperial said: ""Further to overnight media speculation, we confirm that we have been working, together with other stakeholders, to seek to create a sustainable future for the UK wholesaler, Palmer & Harvey, with whom we have a close trading relationship.""David Gilroy, independent retailer expert at Storeexcel, said H&P was in a tough business: ""They make thousands of deliveries to stores every week and making profit from small stores is very difficult and margins are tight.""There's the cost of vehicles and manpower and the profit yield per route is tricky. There are lots of small drops, the unloading time is 15-20 minutes each stop. It's a delicate balance to make profit like that.""Rival distributors to P&H include Bestway, which serves 100,000 stores, and Booker, which owns Budgens, Londis and Premier convenience stores, and delivers to 94,000 outlets.Earlier this year, Booker agreed to be bought by Tesco, a deal that could threaten P&H's relationship with the supermarket giant, which is one of its most important clients.However, the UK's competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), is currently assessing whether the proposed tie-up could reduce choice for shoppers and for small stores supplied by Booker.The CMA has said that if the deal did go through, there is the possibility that Booker could offer inferior wholesale terms to the stores it currently supplies, ""in order to drive customers to their local Tesco"".P&H is owned by its employees, both current and former, and has been in business since 1925."
business	Wall Street: Tech stocks gain as retail shares slide		"Technology stocks were big risers in early trading following a slew of earnings reports after the closing bell on Thursday.Microsoft and Intel jumped 7% and 6% respectively, while Amazon rose 8% and Google-owner Alphabet was up 4.5%.Department store stocks were big losers, sparked by trading worries at JC Penney, whose shares sank 21%.At the open, the Dow Jones fell 0.11% at 23,375.6 and the S&P rose 0.31% to 2,568.5. The Nasdaq added 1% to 6,631.The gains from technology giants drove the S&P tech index up about 2%. The sector has gained about 30% this year, double the gains in the broader S&P index.""Earnings are driving the positive sentiment at the open,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Florida-based Raymond James. ""Certainly a lot of enthusiasm for tech stocks that have reported.""Sentiment generally was also driven by better-than-expected US growth figures.But shares linked to the retail and consumer sectors were among the major losers. In addition to JC Penney's slump, rival Macy's fell 5%.Toymaker Mattel plunged about 17% after it said it would miss its full-year revenue forecast and stop the dividend from the fourth quarter.And Expedia slide 20% after the online travel services company's profit missed Wall Street's consensus forecast."
business	'Women hit hardest by High Street job losses'		"Women have been hardest hit by the wave of job losses that has swept the retail industry since 2011, a study from the Royal Society of the Arts has found.Of the 108,000 retail jobs lost to automation and ecommerce, 70% were among female employees, it found.The think tank also said that regions outside London were disproportionately affected by the retail downturn.The RSA said new jobs could be created, however, if retailers offered more ""experiential"" shopping.""Our research shows that the economic pain that comes with the decline of the High Street is not being felt evenly,"" said Fabian Wallace-Stephens, one of the report's authors.The UK's High Streets have come under pressure from the rise of online shopping, high business rates in some parts of the country, and the squeeze on incomes during the years since the financial crisis.The pace of shop closures rose in the first half of 2019, with about 16 shops closing every day.However the North East and East Midlands saw an 11% drop in the retail workforce, while London had a 16% increase, according to the RSA's report.The RSA's study covered the years from 2011 to 2018, and found that 40,000 new warehouse and distribution jobs had been created by online retailers, but three quarters of those roles had been taken by men.""As ever more people are shopping online, and businesses are introducing automated technology like self-service checkouts, this is changing the types of jobs available,"" said Fabian Wallace-Stephens, one of the report authors.""Women are being hit particularly hard, with jobs growth being contained to roles usually filled by men such as delivery drivers.However, the High Street's decline could be reversed if retailers began offering more exciting in-store experiences, and customer service staff became more like ""in-store influencers"" he argued.An in-store ""influencer"" would provide a mixture of concierge and stylist roles at some retailers, or shop-floor workers in supermarkets providing nutrition or cooking demonstrations, said report co-author Alan Lockey.The RSA report also gave the example of the Lego store in Beijing, which it said felt like one of the Danish toy giant's theme parks.""Many of these experiences cleverly utilise new technologies such as virtual reality to immerse customers in a world made of Lego, or to envisage what customers may look like as a Lego character,"" the think tank said.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said it was disappointing that job losses in retail had fallen hardest on women and less affluent regions.""If the government wishes to support less affluent regions, it should reform the broken business rate system which holds back investment in physical space, and widens regional disparities,"" she said.Sophie Walker, chief executive of Young Women's Trust, said young women were losing out after being ""encouraged into the sector by sexist career advice and the need to find work that fits around the caring responsibilities they disproportionately shoulder"".Around one million young women are trapped in positions of no pay or low pay, she said.High Streets minister Jake Berry said the government was tackling the challenges facing the High Streets including putting £1bn into a Future High Streets Fund.""We've slashed business rates by a third for many retailers - worth an estimated £1 billion - bringing the total amount of business rate support to over £13 billion and ensuring our High Streets are fit for the future,"" the minister said."
business	Amazon in row over plastic packaging	Recyclable plastic	"The US retail giant Amazon has been criticised by customers for increasing its use of plastic packaging.While UK supermarkets and shops try to use less plastic, Amazon earlier this year introduced a new range of padded plastic envelopes for deliveries.One fed-up customer told the BBC: ""Amazon shouldn't be creating more plastic waste.""Amazon said its SmartPac envelopes are recyclable and that it is ""working to improve"" its packaging options"".""Over the past 10 years, our sustainable packaging initiatives have eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials, avoiding 500 million shipping boxes,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.""SmartPac mailers are kerbside recyclable in some cities, and in all store drop-off locations.""Concern is growing about the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans, harming marine life.But Amazon said it urged customers to recycle its plastic envelopes, along with its Prime Now plastic bags.If your local council doesn't take them through its normal kerbside pick-ups, you can see where you can recycle plastic bags locally at the Recycle Now website.Alex, who works in higher education and did not want to share her surname, said Amazon ""has a duty to act and set the standard for others"".""I haven't been buying from Amazon because of the way they treat their workers, and really this is the last straw,"" she told the BBC.""Now that Greenpeace has found that microplastics and hazardous chemicals have reached Antarctica, this should be a stark warning to all of us that this is no time to be complacent.""Andy Taylor, a retail manager from Leighton Buzzard, also said that he was upset about Amazon using more plastic packaging. ""I've had a few of these deliveries recently,"" he told the BBC.""They almost seem to be completely blind to the shift to more ecologically sound practices generally by business.""Is there a sound reason for opting for plastic rather than paper envelopes? Not according to the Confederation of Paper Industries.A spokesperson for the CPI said: ""Not only is paper and cardboard a uniquely renewable, recyclable and re-usable resource, it's also strong and flexible enough to keep goods safe while in transit making it the perfect packaging material.""Many supermarkets, shops on the high street and online retailers have been making the switch from plastic to cardboard for their packaging recently and it's a trend we would like to see continue.""Alex wants Amazon to rethink its plans. She said: ""Even if the plastic is recyclable I am not confident that it all gets recycled, so where does it end up?""Also Amazon's move places the onus on the customer. I don't believe creating plastic packaging and then expecting consumers to recycle it is the answer."""
business	Higher food and clothing prices drives retail sales growth		"Higher prices for food and clothing prices driven up by the weak pound fuelled retail sales growth last month.British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG figures showed that like-for-like retail sales rose 1.9% in SeptemberThat was far higher than the 0.4% increase for the same month last year. Total sales climbed 2.3%.Much of this growth was due to price rises filtering through, particularly in food and clothing, said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.""Retailers have worked hard to keep a lid on price rises following the depreciation of the pound, but with a potent mix of more expensive imports and increasing business costs from various government policies, something had to give at some point,"" she said.""Spending is still being focused towards essential purchases; with consumers buying their winter coats and back to school items, but shying away from big ticket items such as furniture and delaying the renewal of key household electrical goods.""The survey showed that food sales rose by 2.5% on a like-for-like basis over the three months to September and 3.5% in total, while non-food sales rose by just 0.5%, or by 0.9% on a total basis.Non-food sales in stores slumped 2% last month, and slid by 1.5% in total in the three months to September.Yet online sales for non-food surged 10.7% in September - well above the three-month average of 10% - as shoppers responded well to online discounts.Paul Martin, KPMG UK's head of retail, said: ""With potential interest rate rises on the horizon, shaky consumer confidence and ever-increasing levels of household debt, uncertainty remains.""We're now moving into the final quarter, which will ultimately define whether 2017 has been a good or bad year for retailers."""
business	South Africa retail merger collapses		"South African retail group Steinhoff and supermarket chain Shoprite have abandoned a $14bn deal to create Africa's biggest shop network.The tie-up would have been the latest expansionary move by Steinhoff, which bought the UK's Poundland discount chain last year.But the merger talks foundered after Shoprite shareholders complained they were getting a bad deal.Steinhoff shares rose 7% in Johannesburg, while Shoprite jumped 6%.Paul Chakaduka, a trader at Global Trader, said the collapse of the deal would please many Steinhoff shareholders.""For Shoprite there has been this major overhang around this acquisition for a very long time and I think it will free up any uncertainties,"" he said.Steinhoff's brands include Hardware Warehouse and clothing store Pep.As well as its South African operations, Shoprite also has stores in Angola and Nigeria.Steinhoff owns 40 retail brands in 30 countries, including Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK.One of the main backers of the deal was Christo Weise, the South African retail billionaire ranked by Forbes as the second-richest man in Africa.Mr Weise owns 23% of Steinhoff and 16% of Shoprite."
business	US stocks flat but retail sales lift dollar		Wall Street shares ended Tuesday little changed, but the dollar rose on the back of strong retail sales figures.The Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 0.6% last month, the biggest increase since December.In addition, the retail sales figures for June were revised to show a 0.3% rise instead of the previous estimate of a 0.2% drop.In response, the dollar hit a near three-week high against a basket of major currencies.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose 5.28 points to 21,998.99, the S&P 500 index dipped 1.23 points to 2,464.61 and the Nasdaq fell 7.22 points to 6,333.01.Shares in Coach sank 15% after the handbag maker's full-year sales forecast fell short of analysts' expectations.The company said it expected revenues for the 2018 financial year to be between $5.8bn and $5.9bn, whereas analysts had been predicting a figure above $6bn.Dick's Sporting Goods plunged 23% after sportswear retailer's sales and profits in the second quarter came in below expectations.
business	Amazon-Whole Foods deal hits retail stocks		Retail stocks tumbled on Friday as investors digested the news that Amazon had agreed to buy upmarket grocer Whole Foods for $13.7bn.Markets closed little changed, in spite of steep declines in supermarket chains, with Kroger down 9.2%, and Target and Walmart falling about 5%.Shares in Amazon rose 2.4% while Whole Foods jumped 29% to $42.68, above the price of Amazon's bid.Analysts said the deal was potentially a seismic shift in the sector.The S&P 500 index held steady edging up 0.69 points to close at 2,433.15 in early trade.The Dow Jones climbed 0.11% to 21,384.28, while the Nasdaq slid 13.74 points to 6,151.76.A report from the US census also showed new housing construction slowed in May, a sign of economic weakness that pushed Treasury yields lower.
business	UK retail sales in sharp fall in September, ONS says		"Retail sales suffered an unexpectedly sharp fall of 0.8% in September, reversing a jump in August, according to the Office for National Statistics.It meant that third-quarter retail growth slowed to a year-on-year rate of 1.5%, its lowest since the second quarter of 2013.The figures come at the Bank of England contemplates its first interest rate rise in a decade.Sterling fell as traders bet the data made imminent rate rise less likely.Despite September's sales fall, Kate Davies, ONS statistician, said: ""There is a continuation of the underlying trend of steady growth in sales volumes following a weak start to the year, and a background of generally rising prices.""The ONS said retail prices continued to rise across all store types and were up 3.3% from a year earlier, the highest year-on-year increase since March 2012.The biggest downward pressure on sales volume and value in September was in non-food stores. Food stores also reported falls in both measures, but to a lesser degree than non-food outlets, the ONS said.Online sales values increased year-on-year by 14%, accounting for approximately 17% of all retail spending.Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: ""It's important to avoid overstating the negatives in September's retail sales, as retailers did manage to post year-on-year growth despite the range of headwinds they are battling currently.""However, he said September's fall, following strong sales in August, was ""worse than predicted"".Neil Jones, Mizuho's head of hedge fund currency sales in London, said the retail data was ""not encouraging"".The value of pound fell immediately after the figures were released, with sterling down almost half a cent to $1.3126, suggesting traders believe a rate rise next month is less likely.Bank governor Mark Carney has said rates could go up in the ""relatively near term"", with many analysts expecting a hike in November.Alvin Tan, currency strategist at Societe Generale, said that he still felt a rate rise next month was possible, but said a second rise early next year was now very unlikely.Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said a November rate rise ""could come at a challenging time for the retail sector"".With rising inflation and increasing consumer debt, a rate hike just as the industry enters the key Christmas period would be ""an additional headache for retailers"", he said."
business	Retail sales rebound in August, says shopping trade body		"Retail sales rebounded last month despite shoppers facing pressure from higher inflation, according to an industry report.The British Retail Consortium, working with consultancy KPMG, said like-for-like sales rose 1.3% in August, against a 0.9% fall for the same month in 2016.Sales of autumn fashion ranges and back-to-school kit were big contributors to the rise, it said.But the body warned belt-tightening by consumers was still a risk.Household finances have been squeezed by tepid wage growth and higher inflation, leading to an expansion of credit and a decline in savings.The cost of living held steady at 2.6% in July, as a drop in fuel prices offset the rising cost of food, clothing and household goods. Wages are growing at a slower 2.1% rate.Despite the sales improvement, the BRC's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, was worried about the months ahead.She said: ""These figures tell a less positive story about the health of consumer spending than it might seem at first glance.In food, total sales remained robust, easing back by 0.2% points to 3.2% for the three months to August, but remained above the annual average of 2.7%.Online non-food sales continued to motor ahead in August, expanding by 11% compared to 8.8% for the same month last year.Ms Dickinson said: ""Non-food sales have only just recovered to levels seen two years ago, after a dismal August in 2016, while strong figures for food are largely the result of rising prices, leaving growth in volume terms weaker than last year.""Stark challenges lurk around the corner for the retail industry... with the amount of money in people's pockets set to be dented by inflation and statutory rises in employee pension contributions in a few months' time."""
business	Department store sales rise for first time in 2019		"Sales in department stores rose for the first time this year in July, the Office for National Statistics said, with data showing an unexpected rise in total retail sales in the month.Monthly retail sales rose 0.2% - defying forecasts for a 0.2% fall - boosted by online sales.Department stores rose 1.6%, reversing their decline through sales of clothes.But over the three months to July, the ONS said growth in sales in all sectors was ""only modest"".In the three months to July 2019, sales increased by 0.5% when compared with the previous three months, with food stores and fuel stores seeing a decline.That is the lowest increase this year.Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: ""Retail sales saw only modest growth in the last three months,""Although still declining across the quarter, there was an increase in sales for department stores in July for the first time this year.Strong online sales growth on the month was driven by promotions.""The ONS data showed that internet sales recorded a 6.9% jump in the month - the biggest rise for three years.Sales of household goods plunged 5.4% month-on-month in July and were down 3.3% year-on-yearLast Friday, separate data showed that the UK economy contracted in the second quarter for the first time since 2012.Economists looked to the retail sales data for clues for the strength of the economy at the start of the third quarter.Gabriella Dickens, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The rise in retail sales in July was encouraging and supports our view that the economy has picked up in [the third quarter].""Of course, the retail sector only makes up about 30% of total household spending.But spending growth off the High Street appears to have remained fairly steady. So July's figures leave us more confident that the economy avoided another contraction in Q3""."
business	'Why I want to sue Asda over new employment contract'	'Unfair dismissal'	"Duncan Carson has just lost his job as a baker at an Asda store near Stoke, but he is preparing to put up a fight.He is among the Asda workers who have been sacked after refusing to sign up to new contracts, but he aims to take the supermarket to an employment tribunal.""I think someone should stand up to them,"" he said. ""What is the point in having a contract if they can unilaterally change it?""Asda gave its workers until midnight on Saturday to agree to new terms, which include unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice.The supermarket said 120,000 workers had agreed to the deal, and that fewer than 300 had yet to sign up to the new contract.But Mr Carson, who has worked for Asda for 13 years, said the new contract was ""unacceptable"".""I have an appointment with my union officer on Thursday to start the process,"" he said.He usually works from 06:00 until noon as a baker, which he says suits him as he is used to working mornings. The new contract means he can be asked to work any hours from 05:00 until midnight.The move will destroy trust in the business, he says. While the new terms stipulate that Asda must give four weeks' notice of new shift patterns, ""what will stop them changing it again?"" he asks.Asda has extended its deadline to accept the new term by a week, meaning workers who return can do so on the new terms. Those who do not will remain sacked, however.""We have been clear that we do not want anyone to leave us as a result of this necessary change and so we have written to the fewer than 300 colleagues who have not signed the contract to offer a little more time to sign up and continue to work with us, should they wish,"" the company said.It added that it had always been clear that it understood people had responsibilities outside of work and would ""always help them to balance these with their work life"".Neil Derrick, GMB regional officer for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, said his union would offer advice on what legal challenges his members can mount.""We are working with every individual member with a view to lodging a claim,"" he said, which might be based on unfair dismissal, sex discrimination or potentially disability discrimination.Many Asda workers are women who are on part-time contracts to fit in with looking after family members, he added.""This new contract completely turns that on its head,"" he said.However, Sarah Crowther, a barrister at Outer Temple Chambers, noted that other retailers had made similar contract changes and that they were perfectly legal.She said employees that refused to accept the changes had two potential ways to make a claim: unfair dismissal or indirect discrimination.""Those with two years of qualifying employment could bring a claim for unfair dismissal. In that situation it would depend on whether the tribunal was satisfied that there was a good business reason and that procedurally everything had been done with adequate consultation,"" she told the BBC's Today Programme.Ms Crowther added that people ""disproportionately affected"" by the change such as ""those less able to accommodate the flexibility... might have a case, but then it would be open to an employer to justify that"".Last week, Leeds-based Asda said it was increasing its hourly pay rates.The supermarket said it would raise its basic rate for its hourly-paid retail employees to £9.18 an hour from 1 April next year, following an increase to £9 from 3 November.In London, which has an additional allowance to reflect the higher cost of living, basic pay will increase to £10.31 an hour.The retailer, owned by Walmart, acknowledged that the announcement for April pay rises had come earlier that usual."
business	US stocks fall as retail sales disappoint		Weaker-than-expected retail sales figures weighed on Wall Street on Friday, pushing two of three major indexes lower.Commerce Department figures showed US retail sales up 0.4% in April, but economists had predicted a rise of 0.6%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 5.27 points to 6,121.23.But the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.81 points to 20,896.61 and the S&P 500 slid 3.57 points to 2,390.69.Shares in JC Penney sank 14% after it became the latest department store chain to report disappointing results. In the first three months of the year, the retailer's net sales dropped 3.7% to $2.71bn - the third quarter in a row they have fallen.Stock at Nordstrom, which reported after the bell on Thursday, also saw a steep fall of nearly 11%.The sector is struggling to adapt to changing trends, with consumers increasingly shopping online instead of visiting malls.As well as retail sales data, investors were also digesting the latest US inflation figures.The Labor Department said that US consumer prices increased by 0.2% in April, following a 0.3% fall in the previous month, taking the annual rate to 2.2%.Core consumer prices, which strip out the cost of food and energy, rose 0.1% last month, and were up 1.9% from a year earlier.
business	US retail sales rise as stores struggle	'Gigantic adjustment'	"US retail sales rose by 4.5% in April compared with the same month last year, but department store chains continue to struggle.JC Penney said like-for-like sales fell by 3.5% in its first quarter, against the same period last year.Earlier this week rival retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom, also reported declining sales.Meanwhile the US Commerce Department reported that online shopping boomed in April, climbing 11.9% year-on-year.""That's the growth area and that's the whole growth area,"" said Howard Davidowitz, chair of Davidowitz & Associates, a retail consulting firm based in New York.Sales at non-store retailers represented 10.8% of total US food and retail sales in April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Annual growth in the sector has topped 10% for 12 consecutive months.But sales at US department stores in April fell 3.7% year-on-year, marking a two-year run of annual declines, the Commerce Department said.Sales at sporting goods, hobby, music and book stores dropped 2.4%.Sliding sales stoke fears for US department storesBiggest fall in UK retail sales in seven yearsJC Penney, which has more than 1,000 branches across the US, reported net sales of $2.7bn in the three months to the end of April - a fall of 3.7%.Like-for-like sales, which strip out stores open for less than a year, declined by 3.5% in the quarter.Business picked up in April, but February weighed on the quarterly figures, chief executive Marvin R. Ellison said.The company posted a net loss of $180m, more than double last year, in part due to the costs related to plans for more than 100 store closures.""Obviously we had a very challenging quarter in a challenging environment,"" said chief financial officer Ed Record.Mr Davidowitz said consumer spending isn't strong enough to overcome the headwinds traditional retailers, like Penney, face.The US middle class, once the primary customer for chains like Penney, Macy's and Kohl's, has shrunk, while online shopping competition adds to pressure to keep prices down.The price of clothing, for example, increased by just 0.5% between April 2016 and April 2017, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday.That compared to overall an inflation rate of 2.2%, and a 1.9% rate, excluding energy and food.Mr Davidowitz said US retailers are also grappling with a physical footprint that is much larger than in many other countries.That cost drags on results, even for firms that are doing significant online business, he said.""There's going to be a gigantic adjustment, which is going to take place over a long period,"" he said."
business	Luxury goods giant LVMH eyes $14.5bn Tiffany takeover	Higher bid?	"US-based Tiffany says it is ""reviewing"" a takeover offer worth about $14.5bn (£11.3bn) from the world's biggest luxury goods company, LVMH.The companies confirmed the offer in separate statements on Monday, with the 182-year-old Tiffany saying there are currently no talks.LVMH, owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Bulgari.Jewellery has been one of the fastest growth spots in the luxury sector.In a two-sentence statement early on Monday, LVMH said it ""confirms that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany,"" adding that there is no certainty of a deal.A few hours later Tiffany, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said it ""has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH"" of $120 per share in cash.Reports at the weekend said cash-rich LVMH, which also owns Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom Pérignon, Moet & Chandon, as well as Louis Vuitton handbags, made a preliminary offer for Tiffany earlier this month. A takeover would be LVMH's biggest deal since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn.""LVMH's attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.As part of its push for a bigger share of the US market, LVMH has opened a factory in south Texas, which was officially inaugurated this month in ceremony attended by Mr Arnault and US President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka.Tiffany's flagship New York store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the company's fame was sealed after the release of the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, staring Audrey Hepburn and loosely based on Truman Capote's novella of the same name.Global demand for LVMH's products has held up well in recent years, but the same cannot be said for Tiffany, which has seen worldwide sales fall.Like several luxury firms, analysts say Tiffany may have been caught out by the US-China trade dispute and rise in tariffs. It has also been hit by lower spending in its retail outlets by Chinese tourists.LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores.News of LVMH's offer sent Tiffany's share price surging more than 31% to nearly $130.A $14.5bn offer is worth about $120 a share, but analysts said LVMH could afford to go higher, and Credit Suisse estimated that Tiffany was worth about $140 a share.LVMH rival Kering has been looking to expand in the jewellery sector too, and has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci.Switzerland's Richemont, meanwhile, a sector leader with labels such as Cartier, has also been adding to its portfolio, and recently acquired Italy's Buccellati.But, said analysts at Jefferies, ""Tiffany is potentially the biggest prey and the only US global luxury brand""."
business	Retail sales fall in May as prices rise	Shoppers squeezed	"Retail sales fell in May as shoppers began to feel the effect of higher inflation.The Office for National Statistics said the quantity of goods bought between April and May fell by 1.2%, which was worse than economists had expected.Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were up by 0.9% - the weakest annual growth rate since April 2013.The ONS said that higher prices across all sectors ""seem to be a significant factor in slowing growth"".Data showed that average store prices rose by 2.8% over the year, which the ONS said was the largest increase since March 2012.One of the key factors behind the rise in prices has been the fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum, which has increased the cost of imports.Non-food stores were the main contributor to the slowdown after reporting an annual sales fall of 1.2%. However, food retailers reported growth of just 0.1% - the slowest since July 2013.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""It's hard to see the trend in retail sales improving soon. Retailers have not finished yet passing on higher import prices to consumers, wage growth looks set to remain depressed and banks are reporting that they intend to restrict the supply of unsecured credit.""Keith Richardson, head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Shoppers are actually tightening their belts, switching to supermarkets' own-brand products, while the discounters are also enjoying renewed growth.""They're also prioritising their spending, with non-food sales suffering so that consumers can still afford to put a treat in the trolley when buying their groceries.""The gap between wages and inflation is continuing to widen.Data released on Wednesday revealed that average earnings fell in real terms by 0.6% in April compared with same month last year.Inflation stands at 2.9% - far above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank is due to announce its latest interest rate decision at midday.While it is not expected to make any change to rates, investors will scrutinise the minutes from the most recent meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee for clues about inflation."
business	Retail sales fall unexpectedly in January	Wary	"Retail sales slipped back unexpectedly in January, following on from December's dip.Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed retail sales volumes dropped by 0.3% compared with the previous month, well below the 0.9% rise expected.The ONS said the data indicated the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013.It said evidence suggested higher fuel and food prices were key factors.Compared with January 2016, sales were up 1.5%, the weakest performance since November 2013.Figures earlier this week from the ONS showed inflation rose to its highest level in two and a half years at a time when wage growth was slowing down.Fuel prices jumped 16.1% in January, the biggest changed since September 2011.Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013.""We have seen falls in month-on-month seasonally adjusted retail sales, both in conventional stores and online, and the evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown.""Analysts said consumers were becoming wary of spending at a time when employment and earnings growth was slowing and inflation rising.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said consumers were starting to ""crumble"" in the face of inflation pressure.Ruth Gregory, from Capital Economics, said: ""January's surprise fall in the official measure of retail sales volumes has brought the recent run of resilient economic news to an abrupt end. And the rest of the year is shaping up to be tough on the high street, given the expected squeeze on consumers' real pay growth."""
business	Royal Mail union votes in favour of strike action	'Very disappointed'	"Royal Mail is facing its first national postal strike in a decade after staff voted overwhelmingly for action.The dispute between workers and the firm is over job security and terms and conditions of employment.More than 97% of votes by members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed a strike. Turnout was 76%.Strike dates have yet to be announced, but the union could target the annual Black Friday retail sales event in late November and the Christmas post.The CWU says an agreement reached with management last year to raise pay and reform pensions is not being honoured.About 110,000 members of the union were balloted in the dispute.Royal Mail says it has 51% by volume of the UK parcel market.Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU, accused Royal Mail of breaking the ""progressive"" agreement that it reached with the union a year ago.He added: ""Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed.""The CWU's general secretary, Dave Ward, urged Royal Mail to enter ""serious negotiations"" with the union.Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" that the CWU had chosen to ballot for industrial action and said it was still ""in mediation"" with the CWU.""We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action,"" the firm said.Strikes at the privatised postal service were averted last year after Royal Mail agreed to raise pay, reform pensions and reduce weekly working hours from 39 to 35 by 2022, subject to productivity improvements.However, the CWU has claimed that the deal is ""under threat"" under recently appointed chief executive Rico Back.Royal Mail has said it is abiding by the agreement and has awarded two pay rises since last year.It also said it had cut the working week by an hour - although discussions with the CWU about further cuts had stalled."
business	Brexit risks gaps on shop shelves, says retail body BRC	'Good for consumers'	"Brexit brings risks of food shortages if the UK does not resolve issues around customs processes, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned.While the UK has outlined its vision for customs arrangements after Brexit, the retail trade body said it was still waiting for crucial details.It said European supply chains were ""key"" to delivering everyday goods.But Brexit campaigners said technology meant there would be ""no need for hold-ups at borders"".Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for businesses when the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019.The BRC called for significant investment in ports and transport infrastructure to ensure new systems are ready when Brexit takes place.It also said agreements were needed to prevent goods being held up at the border because of extra checks.""Whilst the government has acknowledged the need to avoid a cliff-edge after Brexit day, a customs union in itself won't solve the problem of delays at ports,"" said the trade body's chief executive, Helen Dickinson.""So to ensure supply chains are not disrupted and goods continue to reach the shelves, agreements on security, transit, haulage, drivers, VAT and other checks will be required to get systems ready for March 2019.""The body said disruption or additional costs would ""affect availability on the shelves, increase waste and push prices up"".Earlier this month, the UK government produced a paper setting out two proposals to replace its membership of the EU's customs union.The first was an ""innovative and untested approach"", which would mean no customs checks at UK-EU borders.Its alternative proposal - a more efficient system of border checks - would involve ""an increase in administration"", it admits.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday that none of the UK's Brexit papers provided so far were satisfactory.If the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal or a transitional period - something the government has said it wants to avoid - that could result in delays of up to three days at ports, the BRC said.It added that 180,000 extra firms would need to make customs declarations for the first time.However, Patrick Minford, a Brexit campaigner at Economists for Free Trade, rejected the BRC concerns.""Modern computerised customs procedures are something the EU must by international law put in place for the UK as a sovereign state with its own customs authority post-Brexit,"" he said.""It is also necessary for the UK government to make sure that HMRC has installed all the necessary computer and other systems to handle trade with the EU as a foreign customs authority.""There is no need for any hold-ups at borders, provided both the EU and HMRC take these necessary actions, which they should be preparing already,"" he said.And Jamie Whyte, director of research at the free-trade think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""If the UK leaves the customs union, barriers to the entry of imports are entirely a matter of domestic policy.""This gives the government a huge opportunity to make importing as easy as possible, not only from the EU, but from the rest of the world.""UK consumers will benefit enormously from the lower prices which would ensue,"" he added."
business	Retail winners and losers this Christmas	The winnersFestive food sales 2016The losersWhat's in store in 2017?	"Now the leftovers are all curry and the tree is at the tip, it's time to digest the news from the retail sector over just how merry a Christmas it really was.And it seems that just like Mr Scrooge, UK shoppers were persuaded to open their purses just a little wider this year.So if you're one of those who splashed out on gin, indulged in a new jumper and pulled out all the stops for your festive feast, you are in good company.But how and where was the festive cheer felt most? Here's our look at where the glass is half full and where half empty as we head into 2017.SupermarketsIt's not likely to be a dry January if you're running one of the UK's supermarkets. They have good news to toast this week.Tesco and Morrisons, which have both had a difficult few years, have reported stronger sales. Tesco said fresh food had been ""particularly popular, outperforming the market"", adding that there had been a 24% increase in party food sales over Christmas, while Morrisons reported its strongest Christmas sales for seven years.Even Sainsbury's, which saw a meagre 0.1% overall rise in sales, managed to beat analyst expectations of a 0.8% fall.Discounters Lidl and Aldi don't report their figures in quite the same way - they do not give like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings and are therefore a better comparison - but both reported double-digit increases in Christmas sales, reflecting brisk business.£480mmore spent over the 12-week Christmas trading period compared with the previous year£365 typical household grocery spend in December£52 more than the average month71% market share held by the ""Big Four"" - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, MorrisonsIt looks like we collectively loosened our belts at just the right time for the big food retailers. ""I guess the biggest impression so far is that food retailers did better than non-food in December,"" says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb.According to Kantar Worldpanel we spent almost half a billion pounds more in the final 12 weeks of 2016 compared with the year before (so no wonder we're still ploughing through the chocolate biscuits and checking out stilton soup recipes).But putting it into context, a lot of the good results now are set against a backdrop of pretty weak performances the previous year.If you look at the grocery sector in 2015, Tesco and Morrisons were both implementing turnaround plans, while Sainsbury's and Asda also faced sales challenges.""Overall, food had an ok end of the year and traded ok over the course of the year but that was against very low comparitors,"" says Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Dressed to impressIt wasn't just the food stores that have given the market cause for cheer.Early in the month Next had everyone spooked as it reported a drop in sales in the run-up to Christmas, but plenty of other clothing retailers have reported strong results.M&S surprised the market with sales in its clothing and homeware division up 2.3% - well above expectations for about 0.5% - while John Lewis, Debenhams, Ted Baker and online retailers Boohoo.com and Asos also reported sales growth.Strong festive periods were also seen at Primark, JD Sports and Superdry owner Supergroup, which saw like-for-like sales up 15% over the Christmas period.""The biggest loser is obviously Next so far. They've had a bit of a shocker,"" says Patrick O'Brien from Verdict Retail. Next saw sales of full-price items fall 0.4% and warned of a ""challenging"" 2017.""Next [used to be] way ahead of the others with its online operation. But competitors have now caught up with that in terms of online and collection, with really high growth in online specialists like Boohoo,"" he says.But apart from that the really surprising thing is how few bad results there have been. Partly that is because they started from a low base after the poor sales of 2015, and partly because British consumers simply held their nerve.""Consumers have understood that prices are going up and it's been a good time to buy,"" says Mr O'Brien.Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, adds: ""The British defied the mood music out there and wanted to go out and treat themselves and celebrate Christmas. That's the most surprising thing in a world where negative news is easier to come by than positive.""But if 2016 ended on a positive note, Paul Martin says retail is moving into a ""perfect storm"" in 2017.He warns that around April to July the hedging positions retailers took against currency fluctuations will begin to run out and the full force of the pound's devaluation since the Brexit vote will start to be felt through higher prices for imported goods.Multinationals will flex their muscles a little more over pricing imported goods for the UK market. And costs will be rising as business rates are revalued and the minimum wage rises.Inevitably, he says, retailers will have to look at what kind of price rises their customers can bear. ""We think it will be 5% to 8%. But that can vary substantially across sectors - you will find some cases where it will be 50%,"" he warns.In addition to Next, other retailers including John Lewis and Sainsbury's have warned about the uncertain impact of a weaker pound.The boss of fashion chain Ted Baker has vowed, however, that ""there won't be any price increases this year"".Chief executive Ray Kelvin told the Press Association: ""We were hedged for two years and we have one year left on that. We're a public company, we don't gamble with things like this, plus we also have a big dollar income.""The consensus though, is that consumer spending will be squeezed this year, and Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, says that will make it harder for retailers to generate growth.She also points to the uncertainty around what trading relationship the UK will have with the rest of the world once it leaves the EU.""An announcement about that that doesn't seem favourable could have an impact on confidence,"" she says. But she adds that the mood among retailers is ""not one of doom and gloom, it's caution""."
business	Government abandons Lloyds retail sale		"The government has abandoned plans to launch a major retail share offer of the 9% of Lloyds Bank it still owns.The chancellor said market volatility meant it was not sensible to attempt to sell the multi-billion pound stake it still owns to members of the public.The shares will now be sold via a ""trading plan"" - small tranches of shares sold to institutional investors.Philip Hammond said the private sale would ensure the taxpayer recovered the ""full investment"" made in the bank.He said that £17bn of the £20bn invested by the government, when it bailed out the bank during the financial crisis, had already been sold back to the market.""We need to recover the taxpayers' money,"" Mr Hammond said, saying that he wanted Lloyds to be fully back in the private sector.""The proceeds of the Lloyds bank sale - the priority is to turn those assets into cash and use those to reduce debt,"" Mr Hammond said.He said that the sale of the government's stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland was ""not practical at the moment"" whilst the bank was under the threat of fines from the Department of Justice in America and was struggling to sell its Williams and Glyn branch network."
business	Businesses deny Gove claims on no-deal preparation	'Crystal clear'	"UK firms present at a meeting with no-deal Brexit minister Michael Gove this week have denied his claim that industry told him it is ""ready"" for no-deal Brexit.In the resumed Commons session, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""The automotive sector, who I met this week, confirmed that they were ready, the retail sector said they were ready.""Three attendees at the relevant meeting in Coventry this week told the BBC this was not an accurate reflection of Monday's meeting with manufacturers.""I was at the meeting. There's no way that is the message he could have gone away with,"" said one business leader.Another present, when asked if Mr Gove had been told by the car industry that it was ready, replied: ""No! We said we are planning as best we can, but cannot prepare for all eventualities and tariffs alone undermine our viability. We want a deal. No deal is not an option. Catastrophic.""A written briefing for the EU exit preparedness manufacturing round table has been obtained by BBC News.It was held at the National Automotive Innovation Centre on Monday afternoon and attended by Aston Martin, the British Ceramic Confederation, Ford, Make UK, Toyota and the SMMT.The briefing says the key message was ""leaving without a deal is the worst possible outcome"", that ""short-term disruption is likely to be severe after 31 October"", and that businesses were ""preparing the best they can, but it is creating huge costs, particularly for SMEs"".Another organisation present told the BBC that the Commons' claims did not ""bear reality"", that bigger car companies said they had prepared as far as they can, but there was ""no preparing"" for developments such as tariffs.It said smaller companies had said that further down the supply chain, it was impossible to prepare, because they didn't have the resources or the expertise to prepare and they didn't know what they were preparing for.Other major carmakers have told the government in writing that ""they have done what they can"" but ""you cannot really be ready for a no-deal outcome"".Separately, retailers also again disputed Mr Gove's claims about readiness in food supply. The British Retail Consortium said in a statement that it had been ""crystal clear"" that ""it is impossible to completely mitigate the significant disruption which would be caused by no-deal"" and ""would likely see reduced availability and higher prices""."
business	UK consumer spending growth 'falls to record low'	'Languishing'	"July's hot weather failed to boost consumer spending in the UK which fell to a new low amid Brexit uncertainty and slow real wage growth.Average retail sales over the year to July rose by 0.5% - a record low according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG.They said the ""challenging retail environment"" was taking its toll on both the High Street and online.And grocery sales, which normally rise when the sun is out, were ""lacklustre"".KPMG's UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said that while online shoppers had chosen to go online to update their wardrobes in the hot weather, online non-food sales grew by just 3.7% in July from 7.5% in the same month last year.He added: ""Another category which has historically benefitted from the good weather is grocery, but even here sales are lacklustre, which is a cause for concern.""Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive said a ""combination of slow real wage growth and Brexit uncertainty has left consumer spending languishing"".Wage growth accelerated to 3.6% in the year to May, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, when adjusted for inflation, pay remains below the average recorded before the 2008 financial crisis.Average pay in May this year was £468 a week when adjusted for inflation compared to the pre-recession peak of £473 a week in April 2008.Ms Dickinson said: ""The challenging retail environment is taking its toll on many High Street brands who must contend with rising import costs, a multitude of public policy costs and ever higher business rates.""Total sales in July rose by 0.3% after two months of falls.Like-for-like retail sales in the UK also reversed two months of declines to grow by 0.1% compared to July last year.Ms Dickinson said: ""While retailers will welcome the return to growth, it has nonetheless been a punishing few months for the industry."""
business	US retail sales see strong growth		Retail sales in the US rose faster than expected in October, helped by strong car sales, figures have shown.The data is the latest evidence that the US economy is growing strongly and adds to speculation that there could be an interest rate rise next month.The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.8% in October from the month before, and were up 4.3% from a year earlier.In addition, September's sales increase was revised up to 1.0% from 0.6%.The combined sales rise over September and October was the largest two-month gain since early 2014.The Commerce Department said there was strong demand for building materials in the wake of hurricane Matthew.In addition, car sales rose 1.1% last month after an increase of 1.9% in September. Spending at service stations increased by 2.2% in October as petrol prices rose.The dollar strengthened following the data, amid speculation that US interest rates could be increased in December.Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve - which holds its next policy meeting on 13-14 December - said it judged the case for an increase in rates had continued to strengthen.The US economy created 161,000 jobs last month, and the same data release showed the number of jobs created for the months of August and September was revised up.
business	Higher fuel prices take toll on retail sales	Next 'cautious'	"UK retail sales posted a 1.4% rise in February from the previous month, but there are signs that higher fuel prices have begun to hit shoppers' pockets.In the three months to February, sales volumes fell by 1.4%, a sharper slide than the 0.5% decline for the three months to January.That was the biggest three-month fall recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since March 2010.Fuel prices in February were 18.7% higher than a year earlier.""February's retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February's figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January,"" said ONS statistician Kate Davies.""The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months.""Petrol cost an average of 120p a litre in February, with diesel 3p more, according to ONS figures.However, the 1.4% rise in retail sales in February was higher than the 0.4% increase expected by economists.News of the month-on-month increase sent the pound higher above $1.25.Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said the figures would give some reassurance that higher inflation had not brought growth in consumer spending to a halt.Inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index jumped to 2.3% in February - up from 1.8% in January, the ONS said on Tuesday.However, Howard Archer at IHS Markit said consumers were becoming more cautious as higher inflation squeezed their purchasing power.""The economy's persistent resilience since last June's Brexit vote has been largely built on consumers keeping on spending,"" he said.""With consumers now seemingly moderating their spending, the long-anticipated slowdown in the economy looks set to materialise unless other sectors can make significantly increased contributions.""Fashion retailer Next said on Thursday it was ""extremely cautious"" about trading for the coming year as it reported lower annual profits.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said annual shop price inflation increased from 1.9% in January to 2.8% in February - a 60-month high.""How the year pans out will depend heavily upon consumers' willingness to draw on savings or take on more debt,"" he said. ""Last year's retail boom looks set to become an increasingly distant memory."""
business	UK retail sales fall sharply in December	'Tough 2017'	"Retail sales in December dropped 1.9% from the previous month, according to official figures.Sales across all main retail sectors declined, with the heaviest falls coming at non-food stores, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.It was the biggest monthly fall for more than four and a half years.The Black Friday discounts in late November made it ""even harder... to keep shoppers spending during December"", analysts at Lloyds said.Experts had predicted a much smaller 0.1% monthly fall.Retailers had a ""disastrous December... much worse than expected,"" said Alan Clarke of Scotiabank.Inflation figures earlier this week showed prices rose more than expected in December, ""and now we also know that sales volumes fell"", Mr Clarke said.""This is likely to be the theme for the rest of the year - higher prices will reduce disposable income and hurt consumer spending growth,"" he added.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said ""the squeeze on households' real incomes is gradually tightening, implying a tough 2017 for retailers"".Clothing, footwear and household goods all saw ""particularly sizeable drops"" last month, he added.However, when compared with a year ago, retail sales were up 4.3% in December.""There were some notably strong figures from smaller retailers, in particular butchers, who reported a significant boost in sales in the run up to Christmas,"" said Kate Davies, ONS senior statistician.Shoppers also bought more online, spending about £1bn a week, which was 21.3% higher than in December 2015.Despite the disappointing December figures, ""retailers shouldn't assume that they will lead to a bad January as well"", said Keith Richardson, managing director of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.""Consumer spending held up - against expectations - after the EU referendum and it may do so again.""On Monday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said household spending was still strong after the Brexit vote, but warned the UK economy was becoming overly reliant on consumer spending."
business	Sainsbury's to stop selling fireworks		"Sainsbury's has become the first major supermarket to stop selling fireworks at its 2,300 stores across the UK.The company said it made the decision following a regular yearly review of all its products.Last year, a petition to ban the public sale of fireworks to protect animals, children and people with a phobia attracted more than 300,000 signatures.Pet-owners welcomed Sainsbury's decision with many tweeting that other supermarkets should follow suit.A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's declined to detail why the supermarket will no longer sell fireworks, stating that it was commercially sensitive.Tesco and Asda said they would continue to sell fireworks.Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive and founder of Savvy Marketing, also said that selling fireworks was ""a really expensive way of doing retail in supermarkets"".She said: ""When you go and buy your fireworks, obviously they are not on a shelf anywhere in the store. They tend to be in a glass cabinet that's locked up and a member of staff has to go and unlock that cabinet every single time you want to buy fireworks.""She also said the customer's age has to be checked because it is illegal to sell fireworks to anyone under 18. In addition, the supermarket cannot send back any unsold products to the distributor, ""and they are quite dangerous to keep in the back of shops, which are busy places"".A petition last year calling for a ban, which gained 307,897 signatures, said that fireworks ""injure thousands of people every year"" and ""cause damage to buildings, vehicles, [and] emergency vehicles"".In response, the government said it ""takes the issue of safety of fireworks very seriously. Legislation is in place to control their sale, use and misuse. We have no plans to change legislation"".One healthcare professional said on Twitter: ""Just came here to say a huge thank you and praise to Sainsbury's for the decision to not sell fireworks this year. It is not just the animals who suffer but anyone who is unwell or has a condition like autism.""Scottish National Party MP Alison Thewliss tweeted: ""Really pleased to see Sainsbury's have taken the responsible decision to stop selling fireworks. I hope other retailers follow suit.""A recent consultation in Scotland over the sale of fireworks to the public found that there was support for tougher controls on the selling and use of the products.Of the 16,000 people who responded, 94% wanted tighter controls on the sale of fireworks and 87% supported an outright ban on the sale of fireworks."
