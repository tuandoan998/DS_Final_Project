technology	Amazon: What does 'peak season' mean for employees?	'No more than five deaths'Accidents and incidentsMy trip to an Amazon warehouse	"Amazon orders are pouring into warehouses around the world as people rush to buy Christmas gifts and take advantage of Black Friday deals.But for those fulfilling these orders, peak season - as workers call the run-up to Christmas - is not especially festive.It means long hours, hard work and for some, difficult decisions.One young woman working at an Amazon warehouse in the US describes driving hundreds of miles to drop her child with his father for the whole Christmas period. Her schedule means she cannot look after him.She posted a picture of herself and her child in their car on a Facebook group.The BBC gained access to the group, which has 20,000 members, and is a place where workers discuss their jobs, lives and working conditions.Amazon insists that it pays industry-leading wages and that working conditions in its warehouses are very good.Jeff Bezos, chief executive and one of the world's richest men, has resisted calls for unionisation.The Facebook group paints a complex picture of the firm.Lots of people say they are worried about being fired.Some (but not many) of the group appear to enjoy their jobs; lots of people make light of their daily routines with black humour, memes and videos. Sometimes they share good news about promotions or bosses spontaneously buying them pizza.One has posted a live video of recent protests at a Staten Island warehouse alleging poor working conditions.The first comment below it reads: ""They will take names and six months from now none of those people protesting will be working there any more.""Others point out that there did not seem to be much of a crowd, with some saying that while they agreed with the sentiment, it was ""stupid"" to protest.Amazon told the BBC: ""Fewer than five Amazon associates participated in the event outside the Staten Island fulfilment centre. It was obvious to the 4,500 full-time workforce that an outside organisation used our building and the upcoming retail holidays to raise its own visibility and spread misinformation.""The fact is that Amazon provides a safe, quality work environment in which associates are the heart and soul of the customer experience, and the notable lack of Amazon employee participation shows that associates know this to be true.""One woman on bereavement leave is concerned that she won't have a job when she returns because she is not sure how many times she is allowed to ""be off"" for family funerals. She seeks advice on the group.""No more than five deaths"" replies one.Amazon responded: ""Employees have time-off options they can choose to use if they would like.""Another person on the group alleges that they earned just $20 (£15.50) for working an extra day while having $198 deducted for one sick day.And another describes a car accident she had on the way to work.After treatment in hospital, she called in to work to show her discharge papers to ""prove"" to HR that she has good reason for not being at work.Even though the doctor prescribed bed rest for two-to-four days, the woman says she was advised she needed to return to her manager and start her shift, four hours into it. Not doing so will mean she falls into negative PTO/UPT (paid time off/unpaid time off).The woman pointed out she couldn't lift any objects and was on a lot of medication. She does the sensible thing and goes home. The next day she alleges she was fired.Amazon said it could not comment on specific cases without names and the BBC has decided not to reveal the identities of those in the group.The woman's post receives a mixed response. One worker tells her she needs to start a lawsuit, saying that her bosses had agreed a settlement after she took them to court.But another says she shouldn't have used up all her UPT, as that is what it is for.What no-one says is that she should take her case to a union.On a recent visit to a fulfilment centre at Manchester Airport, I asked general manager Neil Travis why the firm was so against unionisation.""We provide industry-leading pay and benefits and we deal directly with our team. We'd rather hear directly from them in terms of whether there are any issues, whether there is anything they want to share with us and whether there is anything we can do to help them,"" he tells me.""We have a forum that represents people within our building. We'd rather just have direct conversations with the people that work here, and that has been fairly well-received and respected by our teams.""The UK's GMB union said of Mr Travis's response: ""Amazon bosses are burying their heads in the sand if they don't think they have a problem. Conditions are appalling.""Their forum is clearly not fit for purpose. Amazon needs to get round the table with GMB and discuss ways to make their workplaces safer and to give their workers an independent voice.""Amazon hit back, describing the union as ""self-interested critics with a vested interest in spreading misinformation about Amazon"".""The truth is that Amazon already offers industry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits, as well as a safe, modern work environment.""A Freedom of Information request, sent to the UK's Health and Safety Executive by the union and shared with the BBC, suggested that reports of serious incidents at the Manchester Airport site had doubled over the past three years, from 10 in 2016/17 to 22 in 2018/19.The reports include cases of workers fracturing bones, another suffering concussion, falls and a collision with heavy equipment.For injuries to be reported to the UK's Health and Safety Executive under Riddor (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulation) they must be:When I visit, a notice board in the lobby proudly proclaims that there have been 33 days since the last incident, although Mr Travis cannot say what that was. It turned out to have been a minor fall.Meanwhile, evidence is mounting in the US that working conditions could be improved.The New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health Administration said in its recent report, Time Off Task, that employees at the Staten Island distribution centre were encouraged to work faster and limit breaks, causing physical pain in 66% of the 145 workers surveyed.Amazon dismissed the survey as ""biased"", saying only a fraction of workers were questioned.But an exclusive report from tech website Gizmodo suggested that Amazon's own figures submitted to the OSHA revealed ""staggering"" injury rates at the warehouse.According to one lawyer, they are higher than the national warehouse average and industries known to be dangerous, such as waste collection and policing.In response, Amazon told the BBC a ""snapshot of injury recordings"" was misleading, adding that it invested heavily in safety.""Safety training is constant, both in making sure employees know how best to work with the technology in the facility and also how to prevent injuries.""There's a dramatic level of under-recording of safety incidents across the industry. We recognised this in 2016 and began to take an aggressive stance on recording injuries, no matter how big or small, which can result in elevated recordable rates and makes comparisons difficult.""Last month a worker died in an Amazon warehouse in Ohio. Although Billy Foister had a previous heart condition, and there is no suggestion his death was caused by working there, it is claimed his collapse went unnoticed at first, with co-workers told to go back to work.On the Facebook group seen by the BBC, people claiming to have worked alongside him say that he had visited the warehouse's medical clinic the week before, complaining of chest pains, but was not given any time off.Amazon said it was ""deeply saddened by the loss of one of our associates"".""Billy Foister experienced a personal medical incident onsite and lost consciousness.""Several trained and certified Amazon team members responded within three minutes to administer CPR and the AED (defibrillator) and did all they could to support him until local EMS (emergency medical services) arrived, within 10 minutes, to transport him to the hospital for further treatment.""On the wall of the Manchester Airport fulfilment centre is a worker bee - a symbol of Manchester since the 1800s, when the city was full of textile mills, commonly described as hives of activity, with the workers the ""bees"".Amazon's fulfilment centres are the digital age's equivalent and working conditions are undoubtedly a vast improvement on the mills of old.It is far less frenetic than I expected. There are not hundreds of people hunched over workstations - in fact there are far more robots than people on the floor I visited.General manager Mr Travis points out that the company runs public tours, with members of the public and schoolchildren invited to see conditions for themselves."
technology	Call to probe Boston police tests of 'dog' robots	No guns	"Massachusetts State Police has been asked to explain how it is using robot dogs, by a civil liberties group.The police force has spent the past three months testing ""Spot"" robot dogs alongside some of its officers.The robots, made by Boston Dynamics, are believed to have helped with several live incidents as well as training scenarios.The American Civil Liberties Union wants details about how and where the robots were being used.A video captioned with the words ""MA State Police"" and showing the robots opening doors and entering buildings was shared online by Boston Dynamics earlier this year.""All too often, the deployment of these technologies happens faster than our social, political, or legal systems react,"" said the ACLU in a statement given to Techcrunch.In its letter, the campaign group said it wanted more ""transparency"" about the use of the robots, the ways in which they would be used and which officers would be deployed with them.The ACLU said there was a need for regulations governing the use of the robots to ensure they did not trample on established civil rights and liberties or lead to racial injustice.The rights group also wants to know if the robots will ever carry weapons.In response, Massachusetts State Police officials said the robots were being used as a ""mobile remote observation device"" to look at suspicious devices or locations that might be hazardous for human officers.It told WBUR, Boston's national public radio station, the robots had worked with the organisation's bomb squad.Separately, it said the robots had helped with two ""incidents"" but no details were given.""Robot technology is a valuable tool for law enforcement because of its ability to provide situational awareness of potentially dangerous environments,"" said David Procopio, a spokesman for the state police force.Boston Dynamics told WBUR it had leased the robots to the police to retain control over how they were used.A spokesman for the company said there were explicit clauses in the lease agreement that required they were not used to ""physically harm or intimidate people"".The spokesman said Boston Dynamics was open to dialogue with rights groups about how its robots should be used.He added existing laws governing technology used by first-responders covered most of the uses to which its robots were being put."
technology	Nature's language is being hijacked by technology	'Feels good''Gorse growing'	"""Apple"", ""tweet"", ""cloud"", ""stream"" - words that once conjured vivid visions of the countryside are now synonymous with our technological world.And, a National Trust study suggests, just 1% of uses of the word ""tweet"" in conversation now refer to birdsong.Similarly, while in the 1990s 100% of mentions of ""stream"" meant ""a little river"", that has now fallen to 36%.One in four parents and grandparents surveyed worried about children losing the original natural meanings of words.""A lot of new tech is abstract and difficult to understand, which makes it ripe for metaphor,"" Dr Robbie Love, a linguistics fellow at the University of Leeds, who conducted the study, told BBC News.And ""simple and vivid"" words helped to ""express something harder to explain"".""It makes it easy for people to talk about tech they perhaps don't understand themselves,"" he said.""Stream nicely describes the idea of information flowing into our devices - and without the word, it would be hard to describe this complex process.""The study used software to search through two databases of language transcribed from conversations. The first, from the 1990s, comprises five million words and the second, from the 2010s, 12 million.Original uses of the word ""cloud"" dropped by nearly a quarter, with children's conversation switching away from the natural meanings of words in their vocabulary from about the age of 10.""These words are so well known and common across language but also can be adapted in this rich way,"" said Dr Love.""We can see a cloud hanging above us, while cloud computing is harder to fathom.""Dr love said this change was neither ""a bad or good thing, words often take multiple meanings"".""We could drink a 'can' of lemonade or 'can' play the piano, for example"", he said.""Brands that have adopted names from nature, such as Apple, The North Face, Amazon, Nectar et cetera, all have one thing in common, they are aligning their product with something that feels familiar and feels good,"" said Gerry Acari, managing director of the branding agency Vivid Creative.""It's a fantastic strategy to reach out to worldwide audiences - potentially bridging all languages and cultures - without requiring translation.""But single-meaning natural words, such as ""lawn"", ""twig"", ""blackbird"", ""fishing"", ""paddle"", ""sand"", ""paw"" and ""shell"", also decreased in frequency among young people.And some, such as ""bumblebee"", disappeared altogether.National Trust's regional director for the Midlands, Andy Beer, said: ""As a nation we are losing our connection with nature.""Nature connection isn't just about playing outside, it means using all the senses - actively noticing nature, such as the way gorse growing wild by the coast can smell like coconut, how fog in the autumn can cling to your hair, how a spider web can sparkle on a dewy morning..""Mr Beer said helping children spend more time in nature ""isn't about 'teaching' kids or just getting them to observe - it's about helping them think, feel and relate to nature, doing things that really help them connect"".""If we can strengthen the connection with nature, we can strengthen the benefits to our wellbeing, like increased happiness and self-esteem and reduced anxiety,"" he said."
technology	Sham news sites make big bucks from fake views	Billions of dollars	"Forbes and Business Insider are both well-known news sites. So is forbesbusinessinsider.com a new spin-off?No. It has nothing to do with either Forbes or Business Insider.In fact, it's a site that copies and pastes entire articles from other publishers and reposts them with very slight changes.There are 350 million registered domain names on the internet. Experts say it's impossible to count how many are sham news sites.But just like legitimate websites, they earn money from the major tech companies that pay them to display ads.Amazon and Google are two of the world's biggest players in the digital advertising industry.They bring in billions of dollars a year from selling access to ad space across the internet.When the BBC recently viewed forbesbusinessinsider.com, it saw ads promoting major brands including Sephora and Vitality insurance.After Google was alerted to the site by the BBC, it stopped publishing ads on it but Amazon is still doing so.The site was created by a web design firm based in Karachi, Pakistan. Designer Shahzad Memon told the BBC his company built forbesbusinessinsider.com as a test to find ways of increasing search engine optimisation - the ability to make a link to a site appear high up in search results for certain queries.""You don't have to be an advanced hacker to do this,"" said Dr Augustine Fou, a digital advertising expert based in New York.""As long as you know a little bit of code, you can build a basic website using templates.""Often the sites are not designed to be seen by human eyes at all.The laredotribune.com website also - at first glance - appears to be a regular news site for a city in south Texas. There are stories about local residents and President Trump's border wall with Mexico.But the stories have no publication date. There are no contact details for the editorial staff and the site loads slowly due to the large number of ads.Yet the site has had 3.7 million page views over the past three months, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb.Not bad for a news site covering a city of just 260,000 people.But the audience is fake. Bots are used to give the impression of high traffic, generating very real revenue for the site's creators.""We estimate each site is making at least $100,000 [£77,450] a month,"" said Vlad Shevtsov, director of investigations at Social Puncher, the firm that exposed a number of fraudulent news sites. The organisation says ad fraud is a million-dollar industry.Dig a little deeper into the Laredo Tribune's user data, and there are other clues it is not legitimate.Advertisers might ask why there were 500,000 page views in September, which jumped to a staggering three million views in October.Ads for major UK brands including Virgin Media, Superdrug and even TV Licensing were all displayed on related sham news sites seen by the BBC.""We hope more can be done across the industry to clamp down on these instances of pay-per-con advertising fraud,"" said a Virgin Media spokesman.Google says the Laredo Tribune does not breach its advertising rules, and it found no issues with traffic to the site.""That means that next month, the anonymous owner will get the next payout cheque from Google,"" said Mr Shevtsov.But many in the industry say Google does not do enough to ensure advertising budgets are not wasted via other bogus sites.""The ad industry and Google keep ignoring obvious evidence - that they pay fraudsters,"" Mr Shevtsov said.Dr Augustine Fou agrees.""I get why this is really hard for a platform like Google to police. There are hundreds of thousands of apps and millions of sites that use its advertising technology to make money,"" said Dr Fou.""But after years and years of knowing about abuses, they ought to be doing something more proactively, not just taking action after third parties do all the work for them.""Google says it is very invested in the fight against ad fraud. The BBC invited Amazon to comment but it did not respond."
technology	Iran letter raises prospect of 'white list' internet clampdown	Social networks'Likely problems'Private networks	"The Iranian government has written to state-run organisations and private companies asking them which foreign websites they rely on.The effort has come to light 11 days after the authorities imposed a week-long internet blackout following protests against a rise in fuel prices.Some experts believe the latest move signals that Tehran plans to operate a ""white list"" scheme, under which only approved sites would be made available.Officials have not commented on this.But the head of the Information Technology Organisation (ITO) - the Iranian government body responsible for cyber-space - has confirmed sending the letter.Amir Nazemi said he was ""obliged to make sure vital services were available"". He added that he wanted to let security officials know how the decision to shut down the internet had impacted the economy.""I give the people who are watching this from a distance every right to be sceptical about the situation in the future,"" he said.Iran has discussed creating a ""national internet"" since 2005.The idea is to build domestic services that mirror the most popular foreign-based websites and apps, and get Iranians to use them instead.Although that has yet to happen, Iran has introduced an extensive internet censorship system, known as ""filtering"". It has been likened to the so-called Great Firewall of China.The filtering system blocks users from accessing most well-known social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as international news outlets such as BBC News.Many suspect that the authorities now want to move one step further and instead of having a ""black list"" of banned websites, there will be a ""white list"" of permissible ones, with all others blocked.Mahsa Alimardani, of human rights organisation Article 19, says that approach would be ""in line with the worrying indications"" that Iranian authorities want to restrict access to the uncensored internet to certain people ""based on their professional and social circumstances"".The existence of the letter became known after a copy circulated on social media. It gave Google Maps as an example of a ""necessary foreign service"".It said that the government wanted to ""assess the likely problems"" that people might have had in accessing online services.According to Ms Alimardani, ""every mass protest movement in Iran, since the first one in the internet age in 2009, has resulted in further centralisation and regulation of the internet space"".She pointed to the vastly popular messaging app Telegram which was blocked following the nationwide protests some two years ago, after which the authorities made ""a failed attempt to push"" domestic messaging apps such as Soroush.During the recent internet shutdown, citizens were prevented from accessing independent news outlets based abroad. They were also blocked from viewing pictures and videos of the sometimes deadly clashes, which had been posted online.On Saturday, the head of Basij, the state-controlled paramilitary force loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said he wanted to see a ""clean internet"" in Iran.Brig-Gen Gholamreza Soleimani added that he hoped that one day the ""national internet is implemented and satisfies all the country's needs"".While many security officials want to control the flow of information in and out of the country, many people are using methods such as virtual private networks (VPNs) to bypass the filtering system.A couple of days before the blackout started, a high-ranking official had called for the sale of VPN accounts to come under state regulation.The secretary of the high council of cyber-space, Abolhassan Firouzabadi said he wanted the judiciary and ministry of information and communication technology to take responsibility for licensing VPN vendors.If Iran were to implement a white list, either permanently or during periods of unrest, some citizens fear it could disable circumvention tools like VPNs.But others are not so sure.""Iran's internet users and tech experts who have had years of experience circumventing censorship can likely find ways to route around it,"" Ms Alimardani said."
technology	Uber self-driving crash 'mostly caused by human error'		"A distracted safety operator in an Uber self-driving car was primarily to blame for a fatal crash in 2018, a US regulator has ruled.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said an “inadequate safety culture” at Uber was also a major contributing factor.As too were poor, or in some cases non-existent, rules governing firms testing self-driving technology.The findings follow a near two-year investigation.In a hearing to discuss the results, the NTSB urged national regulators to create a more thorough review process before the technology can be used on public roads.Elaine Herzberg, 49, was killed when an Uber-owned self-driving car - operating in autonomous mode - struck her as she crossed a road in Tempe, Arizona, on 18 March 2018.In the car was safety driver Rafaela Vasquez who, according to investigators, had been streaming a TV show on her mobile phone while behind the wheel.Dashcam footage showed Ms Vasquez spent 36% of the journey that evening looking at the device.In its experiments with driverless cars, Uber has mandated that a human operator pays attention at all times so they can take over in difficult situations or when the vehicle encounters a situation it does not know how to handle.""Had the vehicle operator been attentive, she would likely have had sufficient time to detect and react to the crossing pedestrian to avoid the crash or mitigate the impact,"" the NTSB ruled.Uber’s computers detected Ms Herzberg 5.6 seconds before impact, the NTSB said, but did not correctly identify her as a person.The report said Ms Herzberg was acting unsafely in attempting to cross the road where she did - investigators said toxicology reports suggested she had taken drugs that may have impaired her judgement.Nevertheless, the NTSB said Uber had an ""inadequate safety culture, exhibited by a lack of risk assessment mechanisms, of oversight of vehicle operators, and of personnel with backgrounds in safety management”.It acknowledged on Tuesday that the company had made significant changes since the accident.Uber said it welcomed the recommendations.""We deeply regret the March 2018 crash that resulted in the loss of Elaine Herzberg’s life, and we remain committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program,” said Nat Beuse, head of safety at Uber’s advanced technologies group.“Over the last 20 months, we have provided the NTSB with complete access to information about our technology and the developments we have made since the crash. While we are proud of our progress, we will never lose sight of what brought us here or our responsibility to continue raising the bar on safety.”_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	UK reaches 10% full-fibre milestone		"Just over 10% of British homes now have a full-fibre broadband connection, a study suggests.The figures were compiled by consumer broadband advice site Think Broadband.com, which counts only ""live"" connections in its estimate.Full-fibre links are among the fastest available, theoretically capable of handling gigabits of data every second.The 10% landmark was passed late last week and is a significant increase on June, when 8.1% had the fast links.Some areas of the UK had wider access to full-fibre than others, Andrew Ferguson, from Think Broadband, told BBC News.And the technology was available to more than of 10% homes in only 100 out of the UK's 420 council regions.Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, tops the table at 98.7% availability. Belfast is in second place, at 53%, and York third, at 52%.The steady shift towards full-fibre had come from work done by Openreach, CityFibre, Hyperoptic and Community Fibre to lay cables and offer services, Mr Ferguson said.The landmark has been passed just as Vodafone has struck a deal with Openreach to offer full-fibre to more than 500,000 homes and businesses in Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool.Vodafone said its service would offer speeds of up to 900Mbps.By contrast, more than 96% of the UK can get superfast broadband, which runs at 24Mbps. Ultrafast connections, which can hit 100Mbps and above, are available to 59% of UK premises.Reaching the first 10% of coverage had taken about a decade, said Mr Ferguson, but the next 10% would probably be achieved in the next 12-18 months.""That's all dependent on how fast the builds go,"" he said, ""a bad winter may slow things down."""
technology	Tesla's new Cybertruck smashed during demo		"Tesla has unveiled its ""Cybertruck"" pickup truck, but not without an embarrassing moment on stage.The truck's windows were smashed during a demonstration supposed to show how hard they were to break.Mr Musk was heard to swear before joking: ""Room for improvement.""The truck was unveiled in Hawthorne, California, where its stainless steel, angular design was greeted with cheers but also bemusement.""People probably won’t get past the looks of it,"" said Jessica Caldwell, from vehicle marketplace Edmunds.""It looks like a truck version of the DeLorean from Back To The Future.""The pickup market represents a significant opportunity for Tesla as it improves its battery technology, meaning carrying heavier loads over long distances is now practical.According to Edmunds, large trucks have accounted for 14.4% of new vehicle sales up until October this year, compared to 12.6% in 2015. The vehicles have an average selling value of more than $50,000.Tesla's truck will be sold starting at $39,900 (£30,900), a model which has a range of 250 miles (402km), while the most expensive model, at $69,900, will have a range of 500 miles. The truck will seat up to six adults and haul a payload of 3,500lbs, Tesla said.Mr Musk said pre-orders would start immediately, with production starting in late 2021 - though the 48-year-old has a history of missing his own deadlines.The Cybertruck's launch will undoubtedly be overshadowed by the ""fail"", Ms Caldwell said.It happened during a segment displaying how the car's stainless steel exterior, and metal windows, could withstand bullets and sledgehammers. However, when Tesla's head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, threw a metal ball at the front left window, it smashed. As too did the rear left.""It didn’t go through, that’s a plus side,"" Mr Musk said.""We threw wrenches, we threw literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some reason it broke now… I don’t know why.""At the time of writing, Tesla stock price was mostly unchanged in after-hours trading._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Elon Musk reveals why Cybertruck window smashed		"Elon Musk has revealed why the windows of Tesla's Cybertruck broke during an embarrassing launch incident.He blamed the mishap on the order in which a demonstration had taken place.The vehicle was first struck with a sledgehammer in what appeared to be a successful demonstration of its armour body's strength.But this had caused an unseen crack, Mr Musk revealed, which had subsequently led to the windows smashing when they had been hit with a steel ball.The futuristic vehicle was unveiled on Thursday in Hawthorne, California, where its stainless steel, angular design drew a mixed response from the audience.Responding to a fan on Twitter, Mr Musk said the incident could have been easily avoided.""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked the base of the glass, which is why the steel ball didn't bounce off,"" he wrote.""Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door. Next time.""Over the weekend, Mr Musk tweeted footage of an earlier demonstration, carried out behind the scenes moments before the launch, showing the windows withstanding the impact of the steel ball.Despite the awkward mishap, Tesla announced it had received more than 200,000 ""orders"" for its Cybertruck following the demonstration. The firm is charging $100 to reserve the vehicle, but the sum is refundable if the customer later changes their mind.The success of the launch event has caused some speculation on social media the incident, viewed millions of times online, had been orchestrated to go viral.""It's hard to say if that one infamous moment is why Tesla has been able to get 200,000 deposits on the Cybertruck but all the extra attention certainly didn't hurt,"" said Jessica Caldwell, from vehicle marketplace Edmunds.""Moments like that are why Tesla has such a passionate fan base: while most executives are always hyper-rehearsed and polished, Elon Musk has never been afraid to show his human side, for better or worse.""Tesla's fans are notorious for giving the company the benefit of the doubt and assume the technology will be sorted out by the time the truck actually goes on sale."""
technology	Zuckerberg’s tech challenge pale and male, say critics		"Mark Zuckerberg has been criticised for speaking to eight men and one woman in his quest to discuss ""the future of technology in society"" - which he set as his personal challenge for 2019.All nine guests were white.Mr Zuckerberg had said he would talk to ""leaders, experts, and people in our community from different fields"".One tech entrepreneur described the result to the BBC as ""a half-baked mission which devastatingly lacks social awareness"".Sarah Luxford, founder of Tech London Advocates, said the lack of diversity was ""outrageous"".""If he really is committed to changing the face of tech, and giving more people a voice (over and above the normal gatekeepers), maybe he could be the one to rise above the industry as it exists at the moment?"" she said.Dr Nneka Abulokwe OBE, recently named one of the Financial Times' most influential UK tech leaders, also voiced disapproval.""It is unconscionable that Mr Zuckerberg would choose to sit down to talk about the future of tech with a non-diverse group made up of eight white males and one white female,"" she said.""This speaks volumes about his insensitivity to issues of diversity, in terms of both race and gender. We must always remember the richness of thought that diversity brings.""Analyst Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies tweeted: ""What is fascinating is that Zuckerberg, like most, put some effort into finding a woman but people of colour don't even get the token slot.""""It really isn't that hard to find smart, talented people of colour in tech.""Facebook has been contacted by the BBC for comment.In a Facebook post announcing the challenge, written in January 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he intended to explore ""the opportunities, the challenges, the hopes, and the anxieties"" presented by tech in society.He admitted at the time that he found the prospect daunting.""I'm an engineer and I used to just build out my ideas and hope they'd mostly speak for themselves,"" he said.Facebook has published six videos of these discussions over the course of the year. It is unclear whether there are any more to follow.The eight men with whom Mr Zuckerberg was filmed in conversation were Harvard law professors Jonathan Zittrain and Noah Feldman, Mathias Dopfner, CEO of publisher Axel Springer, Dr Joe DeRisi and Dr Steve Quake who run the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, economist Tyler Cowen, Patrick Collison, CEO of payment platform Stripe and historian Yuval Noah Harari.The only woman to take part was Jenny Martinez, dean of Stanford law school.In terms of their ages, eight of the nine contributors were either in their 40s or 50s. Mr Collison was the youngest, aged 31.Journalist Kurt Wagner, who covered the story for Bloomberg, also noted that seven of the nine were either professors or doctors.""Not exactly branching out,"" he tweeted.The topics discussed in the videos included health research, governance issues, artificial intelligence, privacy and the fight against fake news.Mr Zuckerberg famously sets himself a challenge every year. In the past these have included learning Mandarin, visiting every US state and running 365 miles."
technology	General Election 2019: Which non-party groups are sending you ads?	No contactSeen any political ads? Send them to us	"As the messages keep pouring in to our election ads project one thing stands out - just how many non-party groups want to get involved in this election campaign.In the last few days we have seen ads from new anti-Labour groups City Future, Capitalist Worker and Reignite.A group called Advance Together is urging voters to abandon the Conservatives.And the Open Rights Group says both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are building profiles of voters with their personal data - and says we should all be worried about that.But the most intriguing new entrant to the Facebook election campaign is called 3rd Party Limited.We have been sent ads paid for by this organisation for two very different campaigns.One ad features a photo of environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and urges people to vote for their local Green Party candidate.It was targeted at people interested in Greenpeace and Oxford University, living in Didcot in Oxfordshire.The same ad was also sent in by someone in the Cambridge constituency.The other ad is for a group called Save Brexit which wants people to vote... to save Brexit. It was very broadly targeted at people aged over 18 living in England.So what is 3rd Party Limited and what is going on here? Wired Magazine did some digging and found out that the company had been set up by Thomas Borwick, formerly chief technology officer at Vote Leave during the 2016 referendum campaign. What's more the Green Party was not at all happy about these ads.The Greens say they have not been contacted by Mr Borwick or his organisation and have no knowledge of his aims. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""Any Green Party adverts are always clearly labelled as paid for by the party as per Facebook rules. We would always encourage voters to check the source of any information they are receiving due to the large amount of disinformation currently circulating on the web.""It has been suggested that 3rd Party's aim is to cause mischief rather than support the Greens, by persuading anti-Conservative voters away from more electable Labour or Liberal Democrat candidates.If so, the two Green ads we have received seem poorly targeted. Didcot is in the Wantage constituency where the Conservative Ed Vaizey, who is standing down, had a majority of more than 17,000 over Labour in 2017. The LibDems were a distant third. Cambridge was won by Labour last time with a majority of more than 12,600 over the Liberal Democrats.We emailed 3rd Party Limited seeking information about the donors behind the ads and the strategy behind their targeting.We received a reply saying all reportable donations would be reported to the Electoral Commission: ""Green causes are very important to some of our patrons, and our objective, therefore, is to encourage voters to give the Green Party its strongest-ever showing at the ballot box.""The ads, said the email, were targeted at ""areas where our research indicates there are a high proportion of voters who care about environmental issues"".The statement expressed surprise that 3rd Party's efforts were not welcomed by the Green Party: ""If the Green Party feels that voting for their candidates is bad, you would have to ask them why they've decided to stand.""But the mystery remains. If 3rd Party and its donors were so keen to help the Greens why did they not simply hand over some money directly to the party, or at least get in touch to discuss where ads might best be targeted?I texted Thomas Borwick with that question.He replied: ""Third parties are not allowed to work with the central campaigns.""Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social media platform, send a screenshot of it and the Why Am I Seeing This Ad message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk."
technology	Twitter prepares for huge cull of inactive users	Emailed warning	"Twitter will begin deleting accounts that have been inactive for more than six months, unless they log in before an 11 December deadline.The cull will include users who stopped posting to the site because they died - unless someone with that person's account details is able to log-in.It is the first time Twitter has removed inactive accounts on such a large scale.The site said it was because users who do not log-in were unable to agree to its updated privacy policies.A spokeswoman also said it would improve credibility by removing dormant accounts from people's follower counts, something which may give a user an undue sense of importance. The first batch of deleted accounts will involve those registered outside of the US.The firm bases inactivity on whether or not a person has logged in at least once in the past six months. Twitter said the effort is not, as had been suggested by some users on the network, an attempt to free up usernames.That said, previously unavailable usernames will start coming up for grabs after the 11 December cut-off - though Twitter said it would be a gradual process, beginning with users outside of the US.In future, the firm said it would also look at accounts where people have logged in but don't ""do anything"" on the platform. A spokeswoman would not elaborate, other to say that the firm uses many signals to determine genuine human users - not just whether they interact with, or post, tweets.The site has sent out emails to users of accounts that will be affected by the deletions. The firm would not say how many current accounts fit the criteria, although it is expected to be in the many millions. It will send out more notice closures closer to the deadline.The cull will not affect Twitter's reported user numbers, as the firm bases its usage level only on users who log-in at least once a day. According to its latest earnings report, from September, Twitter has 145m ""monetisable"" daily active users (users who come into contact with Twitter's advertising on a daily basis).""As part of our commitment to serve the public conversation, we’re working to clean up inactive accounts to present more accurate, credible information people can trust across Twitter,"" the firm said about the upcoming account removals.""Part of this effort is encouraging people to actively log-in and use Twitter when they register an account, as stated in our inactive accounts policy.”It means users who have died will have their accounts removed unless a loved one or other person is already in possession of their log-in details, and is able to sign in and accept Twitter's latest privacy policy.Twitter's current policy offers only deactivation of a dead person's account once a trusted third-party - a parent, for example - has proven their identity. However, the policy states that in no circumstances would Twitter grant access to the account, which would prevent deletion.The firm does not, unlike Facebook, offer a ""memorialisation"" option that freezes the account in place and disallows new interactions - a measure to prevent abuse.Since inactivity is based on logging in, not posting, bot accounts - such as those which automatically tweet news or alerts - would also come under the cull if the account owners do not log-in before the December deadline. So too would accounts set up specifically as an archive, such as @POTUS44, a collection of all the tweets made by President Barack Obama while in office._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	TikTok apologises and reinstates banned US teen	TikTok explanationRapid growth, added scrutiny	"Chinese-owned social network TikTok has apologised to a US teenager who was blocked from the service after she posted a viral clip criticising China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims.The firm said it had now lifted the ban, maintaining it was due to 17-year-old Feroza Aziz's prior conduct on the app - and unrelated to Chinese politics.Additionally, the firm said ""human moderation error"" was to blame for the video being taken down on Thursday for almost an hour.TIkTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has insisted it does not apply Chinese moderation principles to its product outside of mainland China.Ms Aziz posted on Twitter that she did not accept the firm's explanation.""Do I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a three-part video about the Uighurs? No.”In an interview with BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis, Ms Aziz said: ""I will continue to talk about it, and I will talk about it on Twitter, on Instagram, on any platform I have, even TikTok.""I'm not scared of TikTok, even after the suspension. I won't be scared of TikTok.”Eric Han, TikTok's head of safety for the US, said Ms Aziz had been banned earlier this month after she posted a video containing an image of Osama Bin Laden.""While we recognise that this video may have been intended as satire,"" Mr Han said, ""our policies on this front are currently strict.”When TikTok bans users, it also prevents the same device being used to set up another account.It was on a new account, set up on the same device, that Ms Aziz posted her video about the Uighurs, done in the style of a make-up tutorial, a popular genre on the network.TikTok said that account was disabled after it ran a ""platform-wide enforcement"" that locked out Ms Aziz's device, as well as 2,406 devices belonging to other users who had fallen foul of the site's policies.Mr Han wrote: ""Because the user's banned account (@getmefamousplzsir) was associated with the same device as her second account (@getmefamouspartthree), this had the effect of locking her out of being able to access her second, active account from that device.""However, the account itself remained active and accessible, with its videos continuing to receive views.”But on Thursday morning, the viral video - which has been viewed more than nine million times, across multiple networks - was also removed from TikTok, due to what Mr Han described as a ""human moderation error”.""It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,"" he said.""We would like to apologise to the user for the error on our part this morning.”Human Rights Watch told the BBC that a lack of transparency is deserving of increased scrutiny.""It is hard for outsiders to know the real reasons for the suspension of Aziz’s account,"" said Yaqiu Wa, the non-profit's China researcher.""TikTok does not make public the data on the videos it removes or the users it suspends, or the artificial intelligence tools it uses to determine the removals and suspensions.""While TikTok has repeatedly stressed that it does not take orders from the Chinese government in terms of what content it promotes or removes outside of China, it has done little to quench the suspicion, given that all Chinese companies are not only accountable to its shareholders, but also to the Chinese Communist Party.""The incident marks an early, high-profile censorship dispute for TikTok, a network which has exploded in popularity over the past two years.Globally, the app has now been downloaded 1.5 billion times, according to mobile intelligence analysts Sensor Tower.It looks set to end 2019 as the third most-downloaded non-gaming app, ahead of rivals Facebook and Instagram.That surge in popularity has caused concern in Western markets, due to the nature of its Chinese ownership.In the US, TikTok's deal to buy Musical.ly, a music-based social network, is now being examined by the US Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is looking specifically at data storage and privacy practices.In February the firm was handed the largest ever fine for a US case involving children's data privacy. The company agreed to pay $5.7m (£4.3m) over its handling of data on users who were under 13, acquired thanks to its takeover of Musical.ly._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Web Summit: Branded £720 jumpers sell out at 'geek Glastonbury'	Female knitters	"The annual gathering of tech leaders and entrepreneurs at Web Summit in Lisbon has taken a strange turn, with a Twitter row over hand-knitted jumpers.The €850 (£720) sweater is available to buy on the ""swag"" section of its website, along with cheaper items such as T-shirts and reusable water bottles.Some delegates and commentators took to Twitter to complain about the price.But Web Summit chief executive Paddy Cosgrave told BBC News that, despite the outrage, the jumpers had sold out.""It takes more than 40 hours to make these Aran sweaters so there's only about 12 in total and they are all sold,"" Mr Cosgrave said.A slightly cheaper version - at 780 euros - has also sold out, according to the website, which no longer shows the prices of the items.The back story to the sweater is that Mr Cosgrave has worn one on stage for years, knitted by his wife. Some speakers - including skateboarder Tony Hawk - had admired it and asked for one.""If you want fast fashion from some part of the world made under very dubious circumstances, you can absolutely have a cheap sweater but if you want to support a dying indigenous industry and some wonderful female knitters in Donegal, there's a sweater I've been wearing for a number of years and we made it available online,"" Mr Cosgrave said.But he acknowledged merchandise at a technology conference might be unusual. ""Maybe the World Economics Forum doesn't have a merch store,"" he said.When Web Summit was conceived, Mr Cosgrave and his organisers had had more experience of attending rock concerts than technology conferences.""We wanted to fuse the excitement of a summer music festival with a more traditional business conference,"" he said.And the summit was still described by some of those early visitors as ""Glastonbury for geeks"".Now hosted in Lisbon's Altice Arena, more normally a venue for entertainers such as Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, it still has the air of a festival, with delegates issued with wristbands and popcorn available for sessions on the main stage.Back in 2010, Web Summit was a tiny gathering of ""only Irish people in Dublin"", Mr Cosgrave said.""It wasn't until 2012 that our first overseas delegates started showing up,"" he added.Now, the conference has grown to 70,000 delegates with some high-profile speakers. This year, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, EU negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager are speaking.In addition, from the technology world, Boston Dynamics's Marc Raibert, Microsoft president Brad Smith and Huawei chairman Guo Ping are all on stage."
technology	Microsoft four-day work week 'boosts productivity'	'Rest smartly'Six days	"Microsoft Japan said sales had been boosted by nearly 40% during an experiment in which staff worked a four-day week on full pay.Offices were closed on every Friday of August 2019 and full-time staff were given ""special leave"", which was paid.Meetings were restricted to a maximum of 30 minutes and online discussions were encouraged as an alternative to face-to-face.Japan has some of the longest working hours in the world.A 2017 survey suggested nearly a quarter of Japanese companies had employees working more than 80 hours overtime a month, often unpaid.Microsoft's Work Life Choice Challenge 2019 Summer experiment was popular with 92% of the staff it surveyed after the event.During the month-long trial, electricity consumption had been reduced by 23% and paper printing by 59% compared with August 2018, Microsoft said.The technology giant said it was planning to implement a second Work Life Choice Challenge this winter but would not be offering the same ""special leave"".Staff would, however, be encouraged to take time off to ""rest smartly"", it said.In contrast, Jack Ma, co-founder of Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba, has championed 12-hour working days.In April 2019, he described the ""996"" pattern, in which workers do 09:00-21:00 shifts, six days a week, as ""a blessing"".A report commissioned by the Labour Party in the UK suggested a four-day working week with capped hours would be ""unrealistic"".""Even though some people are compelled to work shorter hours than they want to, most people are compelled to work longer hours than they want to,"" the report. released in September, said.Many workers find going part-time or reducing their days means they end up having to squeeze the same amount of work into the time they do have."
technology	Teen's TikTok video about China's Muslim camps goes viral	AnalysisBy Kerry Allen, China media analyst	"A US teenager's TikTok video clip accusing China of putting Muslims into ""concentration camps"" has gone viral on the Chinese-owned social network.The post appears to be about beauty tips at its start - but the young woman then changes tack to ask her viewers to raise awareness of what she describes as a ""another Holocaust"".Feroza Aziz later tweeted that TikTok had blocked her from posting new content, as a result.TikTok has disputed this.""TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities,"" a spokesman told BBC News. Although, Douyin, the Chinese version of the app, on which Ms Aziz's posts would not have appeared, is politically censored.The company had permanently banned one of Ms Aziz's old TikTok accounts on, 15 November, for posting an unrelated video that had broken its rules on terrorism-related material, he said.As an additional measure, it had then blocked her smartphone, on 25 November, but that too had been unrelated to her posts about China.""Her new account and its videos, including the eyelash video in question, were not affected and continue to receive views,"" the spokesman added.BBC News has contacted Ms Aziz and her family for comment.For its part, the Chinese government has consistently said the camps in question offer voluntary education and training, despite evidence to the contrary.Ms Aziz posted three videos about China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims, between Sunday and Monday.The first has been watched more than 1.4 million times and ""liked"" nearly 500,000 times on the app.A copy uploaded to Twitter by other TikTok users has attracted a further five million views.GUYS NO JOKE THIS TUTORIAL HELPED ME SO MUCH PLEASE WATCH IT pic.twitter.com/BuITSebOu6End of Twitter post by @soIardanAnd further copies have been posted to YouTube and Instagram.Part of the videos' appeal is they are presented as a deliberate attempt to circumvent supposed censorship by TikTok's Beijing-based owner, Bytedance.Ms Aziz bookends her critical comments with talk about to make eyelashes look longer.""I say that so TikTok doesn't take down my videos,"" she explains in one of the recordings.While the version of TikTok used in mainland China does censor criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, the company says it does not take the same action against posts to the separate library of user-generated content it offers elsewhere.And it notes other clips about the mistreatment of Uighurs within Chinese camps have been allowed to remain on its international platform, although they do not tend to get anywhere close to the amount of attention Ms Aziz has generated.The 17-year-old's videos were posted the same week BBC Panorama revealed how leaked documents detailed some of the measures used to brainwash hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.They undermine China's claims attendance at the camps is voluntary and designed to counter extremism.China's UK ambassador has dismissed the documents as ""fake news"".Ms Aziz provides her own list of abuses.""Spreading awareness does wonders,"" she says.""We can reach millions across the world [and] reach those with the power to do something about it.""The BBC has also confirmed that Ms Aziz is in control of a Twitter account created earlier this month. She has tweeted that TikTok has given her a one-month suspension and said that ""China is terrified of the news [about the camps] spreading"".Others have picked up on her posts, including a member of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank, who called Ms Aziz's use of TikTok ""creatively subversive"".Any apps that operate within mainland China need to be approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.Social networks recognise they are not allowed to operate unless they comply with local guidelines - and that means ensuring any content on their platform paints the government in a positive light.TikTok, known locally as Douyin, is heavily filtered.For example, in April 2018, it censored all mentions of British cartoon character Peppa Pig, concerned she was being used as a symbol of rebellion.But the Chinese government is not concerned about, and has less control over, filtering content on the version offered overseas.And in October this year, TikTok denied it screened anti-China content on its international app, saying all its US user data was stored in the United States, with a back-up in Singapore."
technology	'Thanksgiving Four' say Google is punishing them	'Union busting'End of an open era	"Google has fired four employees in what activists within the company describe as an attempt to ""crush"" workers' attempts to organise.The people, who have been dubbed the ""Thanksgiving Four"", had their contracts terminated on Monday.Staff were told via an internal memo that the firings were related to data security and employee safety.But those who lost their jobs have said they were being punished for ""speaking out"".The sackings followed a demonstration at Google's San Francisco office on Friday, attended by more than 200 Google employees. Two of the four fired employees, Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland, spoke at the protest.The Silicon Valley giant has confirmed the authenticity of the memo, first published by Bloomberg, but would not comment further.Google's Security and Investigations team said the employees were routinely accessing information about other projects and employees inappropriately.""Our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employees’ materials and work,” the memo read.""This includes searching for, accessing, and distributing business information outside the scope of their jobs - repeating this conduct even after they were met with and reminded about our data security policies.""This information, along with details of internal emails and inaccurate descriptions about Googlers’ work, was subsequently shared externally.""At Friday's protest, Ms Rivers told the crowd she had been put on administrative leave for accessing confidential documents. She tweeted on Monday that her contract had been terminated.""Four of our colleagues took a stand and organised for a better workplace,"" a statement representing the Four, and other organising employees, read. The confirmed Mr Berland was among the four. The other two employees’ identities have not been made public.The statement continued: ""This is explicitly condoned in Google's Code of Conduct, which ends: 'And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up’.""When they did, Google retaliated against them. Today, after putting two of them on sudden and unexplained leave, the company fired all four in an attempt to crush worker organising.”Among the issues causing discomfort among Google employees is the firm's work with the US Border Patrol. More than 1,500 workers have signed a petition demanding Google backs down from its bid to provide the agency with cloud computing services.But the workers point to Google's hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm which bills itself as a leader in helping major firms avoid ""union vulnerability”, as a sign of the search giant’s growing unease at internal activism.The row has caught the attention of Washington. ""This type of union busting is unacceptable,"" tweeted presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders.""I say to Google: it is time to address the racism, harassment, and harmful contracts at your company and treat your workers with the respect and dignity they deserve.""Observers see the move as heralding the end of Google's famously open working culture. Executives have locked down the degree to which employees can access information on projects they are not involved with, while earlier this month Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai told staff its weekly ""all-hands"" meeting would no longer take place.The open forum, which used to take place every Friday, will be replaced by a monthly meeting that focused only on ""product and business strategy"", according to tech news site The Verge, referencing an internal memo sent at the time.No longer allowed at the meetings: free-flowing questions on Google's political controversy, such as its role in China, dealings with the military, and co-operation with US Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement - known as Ice.""They think this will crush our efforts, but it won't,"" the Google workers statement distributed on Monday added.""For every one they retaliate against, there are hundreds of us who will fight, and together we will win. One of the most powerful companies in the world wouldn't be retaliating against us if collective action didn't work.""_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Rouen hospital turns to pen and paper after cyber-attack		"A cyber-attack on a hospital in Rouen last week caused ""very long delays in care"", reports the AFP news agency.Medical staff at the French city's University Hospital Centre (CHU) were forced to abandon PCs as ransomware had made them unusable, a spokesman said.Instead, staff returned to the ""old-fashioned method of paper and pencil"", said head of communications Remi Heym.No patients were endangered as a result of the cyber-attack, the hospital said, in a statement published on Facebook.The 1,300-bed hospital has not revealed details about the strain of ransomware with which it was infected.It said servers and many desktop PCs were rendered out of action by the attack, leaving staff to handle appointments by phone, issuing written prescriptions and reports.No medical or personal data has gone missing as a result of the attack, according to the hospital.France's national cyber-crime agency, ANSSI, helped limit the scale of the outbreak, France's Le Monde newspaper reported. The paper reports that the agency also assisted with cleaning up computers infected by the virus, re-installing software and recovering encrypted files.The hospital stated it would not pay any ransom to have its files restored, adding that all its systems should be returned to normal by this weekend.A formal investigation into who was behind the ransomware has been initiated by French police.Le Monde reported that ransomware attacks on French hospitals were rare, but said two other establishments had been hit in recent years.Hospitals have become a favourite target of cyber-attackers because the patient data they hold is highly valuable and the consequences of the data becoming inaccessible can be life-threatening.The biggest outbreak was in August this year, which impacted 120 hospitals and offices forming the Ramsay private hospital group. That organisation reportedly paid the ransom to unlock computers and restore encrypted files.In May 2017, a cyber-attack crippled large parts of the NHS - 47 trusts were affected and seven had to temporarily close their doors in A&E to ambulances."
technology	Google tackles the black box problem with Explainable AI		"There is a problem with artificial intelligence.It can be amazing at churning through gigantic amounts of data to solve challenges that humans struggle with. But understanding how it makes its decisions is often very difficult to do, if not impossible.That means when an AI model works it is not as easy as it should be to make further refinements, and when it exhibits odd behaviour it can be hard to fix.But at an event in London this week, Google's cloud computing division pitched a new facility that it hopes will give it the edge on Microsoft and Amazon, which dominate the sector. Its name: Explainable AI.To start with, it will give information about the performance and potential shortcomings of face- and object-detection models. But in time the firm intends to offer a wider set of insights to help make the ""thinking"" of AI algorithms less mysterious and therefore more trustworthy.""Google is definitely the underdog behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in terms of the cloud platform space, but for AI workloads I wouldn't say that's the case - particularly for retail clients,"" commented Philip Carter from the consultants IDC.""There's a bit of an arms race around AI... and in some ways Google could be seen to be ahead of the other players.""Prof Andrew Moore leads Google Cloud's AI division.He told the BBC the secret behind the breakthrough was ""really cool fancy maths"".The transcript below has been edited for clarity and length:Can you explain what led to Explainable AI?One of the things which drives us crazy at Google is we often build really accurate machine learning models, but we have to understand why they're doing what they're doing. And in many of the large systems we built for our smartphones or for our search-ranking systems, or question-answering systems, we've internally worked hard to understand what's going on. Now we're releasing many of those tools for the external world to be able to explain the results of machine learning as well. The era of black box machine learning is behind us.How do you go about doing that - it's not as though you can peer into a neural net and see why an input became an output?The main question is to do these things called counterfactuals, where the neural network asks itself, for example, 'Suppose I hadn't been able to look at the shirt colour of the person walking into the store, would that have changed my estimate of how quickly they were walking?' By doing many counterfactuals, it gradually builds up a picture of what it is and isn't paying attention to when it's making a prediction.This is really important, isn't it from a confidence point of view? If we're going to trust not just our businesses, but our lives to artificial intelligence algorithms, it's no good if, when things go wrong, we can't work out why.Yes. It's really important for societal reasons and fairness reasons and safety reasons. But I will say that no self-respecting AI practitioner would ever release a safety-critical machine learning system without having additional guardrails on it beyond just having Explainable AI.To be clear, are you saying Google has completely solved the black box problem, or just that you're shining a bit of light in there?With the new Explainable AI tools we're able to help data scientists do strong diagnoses of what's going on. But we have not got to the point where there's a full explanation of what's happening. For example, many of the questions about whether one thing is causing something or correlated with something - those are closer to philosophical questions than things that we can purely use technology for.One AI service you aren't offering clients is facial recognition. You've limited yourselves instead to letting clients detect but not recognise faces, with an exception made for those of celebrities. Microsoft and Amazon, by contrast, allow users to build more general facial recognition capabilities into their tools. Why is your approach different?In general, within Google, we understood how important it is that artificial intelligence is applied responsibly. And so, our chief executive Sundar Pichai commissioned a set of a principles that we operate with. They include the fact that we should never be doing harm, and that we should be making sure that the decisions of the systems are unbiased, fair and accountable. As a result of this it does mean that we are very careful. And it does sometimes come across that we are reluctant to just release something and hope that it works because we subject everything to a battery of tests to make sure they are working in a way that's desirable.Switching tack. Before you took on this role you did AI work for the US Department of Defense. And you joined soon after Google pulled out of a tie-up with the Pentagon to label drone footage - a decision you expressed concerns about. Do you think Google's decision to drop Project Maven was wrong?That was before my time. So I'm not going to comment on that specific decision.I will say that one of my roles is to serve on the United States Artificial Intelligence Congressional Commission on AI for national security. And myself, and many other folks throughout the industries understand that we technology providers do have an obligation to help protect countries and societies, as well as producing consumer products as well.A couple of weeks ago, our chief legal counsel, Kent Walker, made some comments about Google's great desire to help out in aspects of national security which will make people safer.But Google Cloud is ruling out work on weapon systems?Google's AI principles say that they're not going to be working on offensive weapons systems.So do you think that Google should be pursuing military or other national security contracts in the future?I don't want to talk about any specific contracts. But for example, Google is actively helping out with a question of ""deepfake"" detection, which is this new fear that artificially constructed videos or images might become so realistic that they actually cause societal problems. And so we're partnering with a major government agency in the United States to help deal with that potential.The decision to abandon Project Maven followed internal opposition to the effort from many Google employees. Do you agree with the view of others, including Microsoft president Brad Smith, that while it's worth listening to workers' concerns you also sometimes need to push back against employee activism?One of the things I love about Google, and why I chose to return to Google to work is that it is full of lots of creative voices. And pretty much everything we do, including the design of the shape of buttons on a front-end system, we end up having massive internal arguments about. Eventually you do have to make a decision one way or the other. The idea of doing top-down management is completely out of Google's culture. But knowing that people are going to disagree and having leadership commit is also something that we are very clear that we do do."
technology	Amazon begins appeal over Pentagon cloud contract		"Amazon has filed an intention to appeal the US Department of Defense's decision to give a major contract to Microsoft.Amazon had been considered the favourite to win the deal, worth $10bn over the next 10 years.The company, which already provides cloud computing to the US Central Intelligence Agency, said the decision was made due to political pressure.In July, President Donald Trump threatened to intervene after what he described as ""tremendous complaints"".Mr Trump had previously attacked Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, which has been critical of his presidency.The Pentagon subsequently delayed its decision to award the contract until 25 October, when it was announced the work would be given to Microsoft.Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the competition was fair.""I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,"" he told reporters in the South Korean capital Seoul.The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project - known as JEDI - is designed to modernise the antiquated data and communication systems within the US military. The contract is considered to be particularly lucrative if other government departments follow the Defense Department's lead when upgrading their own systems.An Amazon spokesperson told the BBC: ""Amazon Web Services is uniquely experienced and qualified to provide the critical technology the US military needs, and remains committed to supporting the DoD's modernisation efforts.""We also believe it's critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence.""Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias - and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified.""The BBC understands Amazon submitted its intention to protest against the decision to the Court of Federal Claims last Friday. The formal appeal itself will be filed at a later stage.Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.Four companies had initially been in the running for the deal when the process was launched two years ago. IBM was eliminated, as was Oracle - which lodged an unsuccessful legal challenge alleging conflict of interest stemming from Amazon's hiring of two former Defense Department employees.

technology	UK gambling machines loaded with AI 'cool off' system	'Staff alerted'	"Every gambling machine in the UK's betting shops is being updated with software designed to detect and prevent problematic behaviour in players.The system locks gamblers out of machines for 30 seconds if erratic or excessive play is detected.While the brief lockdown is in effect, warnings about safe gambling are displayed on the machines' screens.One expert said the enforced break was ""probably not long enough to have a positive effect"".The artificial intelligence (AI) Anonymous Player Awareness System was launched this month by the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), an industry group representing 90% of the UK betting and gaming market.Among the behaviour patterns it tries to detect are chasing losses, spending too long on a single machine and playing a succession of games rapidly.""It was rolled out to all our machines in our 1,600 shops in early November,"" a spokesman for Betfred told the BBC.""These alerts are now operational on machines in all 3,200 Ladbrokes and Coral shops,"" a Ladbrokes Coral spokesman added.William Hill confirmed the software had been installed on its betting machines, too.The Telegraph reported that other firms across the industry may also adopt the software.Thousands of shops have already installed the technology on betting machines, according to the BGC.When an enforced break is triggered on a gaming machine, staff in betting shops behind the counter receive an alert, a BGC spokesman said.""The staff behind know and probably would come out to check you're ok and have a discussion with you if there are any issues,"" he added.The BGC had already rolled out the system for players who used personal accounts to log in to and play games. It would take previous problematic gambling behaviour into account when analysing play.However, live behavioural analysis has now been extended to anyone using a betting terminal, whether they log in or not.Some have questioned how effective the 30 second breaks will be.""This is a step in the right direction but obviously needs to be monitored and evaluated,"" said Mark Griffiths, professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University.However, he added, ""The mandatory break is probably not long enough to have a positive effect.""In a study of Norwegian gambling machines published in September, Prof Griffiths and colleagues evaluated whether an enforced 90 second break could curtail problematic gambling behaviour.The research found that the break caused ""no significant effect"" on the amount of money staked during a subsequent gambling session or how long that session lasted."
technology	Tech Tent: Who needs another social network?	Invitation only	"The reputation of the big social networks seems to sink every week. From Facebook to Twitter, from Snapchat to Instagram, concerns about everything from fake news to cyber-bullying are making many people wonder whether there is a better way to communicate online.On this week's Tech Tent, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tells us why he thinks he has the answer. He has launched a new social network WT.Social, which is ad-free and promises high-quality content.If you pay a fee you can join straightaway, if not you have to wait for a while and hope that an existing member invites you in. At the moment it looks like a very bare-bones web-based operation - there is no app - but already more than 300,000 people have expressed an interest in joining.When he popped into the Tech Tent this week, I put it to him that there had been plenty of attempts at something similar which had come to nothing. He laughed and pointed out that on one such doomed network I appeared to be his only friend.I wanted to know how he was going to get people hooked - but he said the whole mission was about rejecting the idea that a social network had to be addictive: ""The social networks with a pure advertising business model have every incentive to put forward content that's addictive, that keeps you clicking. Engagement is their main metric.""That, he says, is why fake news and misinformation spreads through these networks.Instead Jimmy Wales wants WT.Social to be packed with high-quality content and debate that people will value - and then feel inclined to support financially.It sounds utopian but he points to the success of Wikipedia, the fifth most popular website which has neither ads nor clickbait headlines. ""There's no thought about optimising for addiction or time on site and yet it's incredibly popular. And I think one of the reasons it is popular is that people say, 'Yeah, I just I want to know something. So I go there and I learn something.'""I am sure the likes of Facebook and Twitter started with similarly utopian visions but then found that trying to set boundaries for the online behaviour of millions of users was a herculean task, involving thousands of moderators and some very expensive technology.Again, he points to Wikipedia where moderation is in the hands of the community. Unlike Facebook, where users report offensive content and the company eventually decides whether to remove it, volunteers will take down material they see as contravening the network's rules.He added: ""You also have to be willing to ban people, to say, 'Look, this is absolutely not welcome here', which is hard to do if your business model is around engagement, because flame wars definitely keep people on site longer.""It certainly sounds like an attractive proposition but much will depend on whether enough people pay to provide the funds to take the project forward. An app, which will be vital to making WT.Social a user-friendly experience, will come in the first half of next year if there is enough cash to hire developers.The odds are against Jimmy Wales - WT.Social is an offshoot of WikiTribune, a platform which he hoped would transform journalism but struggled to make an impact.Many people say they do not like the current social media model - the problem is convincing them to move to an unfamiliar place where they may fear there will be nobody they know."
technology	DJI makes app to identify drones and find pilots	‘Right behind that building’Incoming regulation	"Drone maker DJI has demonstrated a way to quickly identify a nearby drone, and pinpoint the location of its pilot, via a smartphone.The technique makes use of a protocol called “Wi-Fi Aware”, with which the drone essentially broadcasts information about itself.The company said it would help prevent security threats and disruption, and give members of the public peace of mind.But experts believe sophisticated criminals would still be able to circumvent detection.“It’s going to be very useful against rogue drones,” said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who studies the impacts of the drone industry.“But it's not going to be enough to fight people with real bad intentions, because these are going to be the first people to hack this system.""DJI told the BBC it could add the functionality to drones already on the market via a software update.The firm explained: ""Using a simple app, anyone within radio range of the drone can receive that signal and learn the location, altitude, speed and direction of the drone, as well as an identification number for the drone and the location of the pilot.""However, a spokesman said that will only happen once pending regulation regarding remote identification of drones has been agreed upon.He added that DJI has not yet decided whether it will force its customers to install the update.While the majority of drone operators act properly, there have been a number of high-profile instances of pilots behaving illegally - and others where suspicion of drone activity has caused huge disruption.In December 2018, Gatwick Airport, in Sussex, England, was brought to a standstill after reports of a drone apparently flying in protected airspace.“If Gatwick staff had a smartphone enabled with this capability in their pockets,” explained Adam Lisberg, from DJI, ""they could have taken it out, seen a registration number for the drone, seen the flight path, and the location of the operator.“They could look on the map and say: ‘Right behind that building.’”Mr Lisberg said the same method could be used to help build trust. One scenario, he suggested, might be a member of the public using an app to discover a nearby drone was owned by a construction firm, and was inspecting a roof at a particular address.“That sounds like a step in the right direction,” added Ms Franke. “If we are moving into a world where drones will be more ubiquitous, we do need for anyone to get a sense of whether a drone is there for a legitimate reason or not.""All drone manufacturers will eventually need to adopt a system of remote identification in order to comply with upcoming regulation set to be put in place in different countries.The US Federal Aviation Administration, along with the country's Department of Transport, is expected to unveil proposed rules for mandatory remote drone ID next month - though that move as been repeatedly delayed.Even once agreed upon, the measures could take more than a year to implement. The FAA has told drone makers to come up with their own solutions in the meantime.DJI said it would roll out its Remote ID capabilities once its obligations were more clear. It could apply the changes to drone models dating back “several years”, it said.Widespread adoption of the technology will also be held back somewhat by so-far limited inclusion of the “Wi-Fi Aware” protocol in popular smartphones, such as Apple's iPhone, which currently does not support it._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Brain implants used to fight drug addiction in US		"Patients with severe opioid addiction are being given brain implants to help reduce their cravings, in the first trial of its kind in the US.Gerod Buckhalter, 33, who has struggled with substance abuse for more than a decade with many relapses and overdoses, has already had the surgery.Lead doctor Ali Rezai described the device as a ""pacemaker for the brain"".But he added it was not a consumer technology and should not be used for ""augmenting humans"".Mr Buckhalter had his operation on 1 November at the West Virginia University Medicine Hospital. Three more volunteers will also have the procedure.It starts with a series of brain scans. Surgery follows with doctors making a small hole in the skull in order to insert a tiny 1mm electrode in the specific area of the brain that regulate impulses such as addiction and self-control.A battery is inserted under the collarbone, and brain activity will then be remotely monitored by the team of physicians, psychologists and addiction experts to see if the cravings recede.So-called deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating a range of conditions including Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and obsessive compulsive disorder. Some 180,000 people around the world have brain implants.This is the first time DBS has been approved for drug addiction and it has been a complex trial, involving many teams, including ethicists, psychologists and many regulators.Over the next two years the patients will be closely monitored.Dr Rezai told the BBC: ""Addiction is complex, there are a range of social dynamics at play and genetic elements and some individuals will have a lack of access to treatments so their brains will slowly change and they will have more cravings.""""This treatment is for those who have failed every other treatment, whether that is medicine, behavioural therapy, social interventions. It is a very rigorous trial with oversight from ethicists and regulators and many other governing bodies.""He points to figures which suggest overdoses are the main cause of death for under-50s in the US.""Over half of patients relapse. We need to find solutions because it is a life-threatening situation and something which impacts family and loved ones.""West Virginia has the highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving opioids in the US. In 2017 there were 49.6 such deaths per 100,000 people, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Earlier this year, the UK's Royal Society warned of the ethical dangers of merging machines and humans, and were especially concerned about the plans of technology firms such as Facebook and Elon Musk's Neuralink which have both announced research to develop commercial products.Neuralink has now applied to start human trials in the US, with electrodes inserted into the brains of patients with paralysis.And Facebook is supporting research that aims to come up with a headset that can transcribe words at a rate of 100 per minute, just by thinking.Dr Rezai is sceptical about consumer tech firms getting involved in this area.""I think it is very good for science and we need more science to advance the field and learn more about the brain. This is not for augmenting humans and that is very important. This is not a consumer technology.""""When it comes to applications, it needs to be heavily regulated. This is not like getting a flu shot or a tattoo. Surgery has inherent risks and is not trivial. It is only for those with chronic disease who have failed all other treatments and are without hope."""
technology	Apple throws Instagram 'stalker' app off store	'On steroids'	"Apple has banned an app that let people monitor others' activity on Instagram.Like Patrol charged a fee to notify users which posts their friends had ""liked"" and who they had recently followed.The action comes a month after Instagram had tried to force the app to shut down after accusing it of scraping people's data without their consent.Like Patrol's Mexico-based developer insists the app merely used public data.And Sergio Luis Quintero told the BBC that he now plans to challenge Apple's ban.""We plan to appeal this decision in the coming days,"" he said.He added that he also intended to make Like Patrol's code open source so that others could reproduce its functionality.The app's removal was first reported by Cnet.Like Patrol was never offered on Google Play.Until recently, Instagram offered its own more basic means to see what friends were up to on its platform.But it removed the Following Tab in October after acknowledging some users had been ""surprised"" to learn their activities could be tracked via the facility.Mr Quintero had described Like Patrol as being a version of the tab ""on steroids"".The ""insights"" it offered included:The service had proved popular with some users.""Great tool to keep track of my teenagers... without them thinking I'm being nosy,"" read one review on Apple's App Store.But several technology blogs claimed it encouraged ""creepy"" behaviour.""Apps such as Like Patrol represent just one of the ways that technology has helped people stalk others,""said security company Malwarebytes.Instagram itself said the software had violated its policies.""Like Patrol was scraping people's data, so we are taking appropriate enforcement action against them,"" a spokeswoman said last month.But Mr Quintero said he did not accept the firm's criticism.""There is a strong hypocrisy in Facebook's condemnation of our app,"" he told the BBC,""Like Patrol does not collect data from Instagram users, it provides the users with a tool to rearrange information that is already available to them.""Everything the user sees lives only in the user's device, we do not have a login, we do not centralise any information, if the user deletes the app every bit of data he was able to see in Like Patrol is deleted.""While Apple has blocked new users from downloading the app, it is not wiping it from iPhones it has already been loaded on to. So, in theory, Like Patrol could continue serving its existing members.But some are hoping it will now be abandoned.""This app may well be gone but there are undoubtedly many more still out there,"" said Lisa Forte, founder of Red Goat Cyber Security.""Our data and privacy is valuable. Apps like this one can be hugely intrusive.""Be very cautious with what apps you decide to download and always keep your phone updated."""
technology	TikTok and Apple decline to testify over China	Police-tracking app'Counterintelligence threat'	"Both TikTok and Apple have declined to testify to US Congress in a hearing, about their ties to ChinaTuesday's hearing is designed to explore the relationships the US-based technology industry has with China and whether there are national security issues as a result.TikTok said it was unable to send a suitable delegate ""on short notice"" but was committed to ""working productively"" with Congress.Apple said it had no comment.""I've invited Apple and TikTok [US] to testify on Tuesday about their business in and with China and the risks to American consumers. So far, they are both refusing. Something to hide?"" tweeted Republican senator Josh Hawley, who has organised Tuesday's session.It is unclear which other companies, if any, have been invited to testify.In an interview with news website Axios, Mr Hawley said he did not trust any of the technology giants.Previously on Twitter he has criticised Apple for removing the Taiwanese flag emoji in Hong Kong and banning the police-tracking app used by protesters in the territory.""Who is really running Apple? [Chief executive] Tim Cook or Beijing?"" he asked.In a statement, the Chinese video-sharing platform TikTok said it was ""committed"" to ""working productively"" with Congress on issues around national security interests.""Unfortunately, on short notice we were unable to provide a witness who would be able to contribute to a substantive discussion,"" it said.In a previous statement, in October, it said it had never been asked by the Chinese government to remove content and would refuse such a request.It also said US users' data was all stored inside the United States.TikTok says 60% of its US users are aged between 16 and 24.Last week, it was reported TikTok was undergoing a national security review of its purchase of the app Musical.ly.Its parent company, ByteDance, bought Musical.ly for $1bn (£773m) in 2017.In an open letter, two senior US politicians described TikTok as ""a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore."""
technology	Google to restrict political adverts worldwide	The databases explained	"Google is extending a ban on political campaigns targeting advertising at people based on their supposed political leanings.It said political groups would soon only be able to target ads based on ""general categories"" such as age, gender and rough location.This restriction is already in place in the UK and the rest of the EU but will be imposed worldwide on 6 January 2020.That could have big implications for next year's US Presidential vote.The firm said it would also clarify under what circumstances it would remove political ads for making ""false claims"".For example, Google would remove ads that falsely claimed that a candidate had died or that gave the wrong date for an election.However, it would not ban claims that you cannot trust a rival party, for instance, which would be viewed as being a matter of opinion.A spokeswoman told the BBC the new guidance would be provided within a week.Google's approach to deliberately misleading statements puts it at odds with Facebook.Mark Zuckerberg said his social network would not fact-check advertising from political candidates or campaigns, although it has since stressed that this does not amount to a totally hand-off approach.""We prohibit misinformation about voting and do not allow ads which contain content previously debunked by our third party fact-checkers,"" said a spokesman.""As we've said, we are looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads.""Twitter, meanwhile, has said it would disallow political advertising altogether.Google’s new policy puts it somewhere roughly in the middle, suggesting a hands-off approach, with only the the most obvious misinformation being acted upon.“We recognise that robust political dialogue is an important part of democracy, and no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim, and insinuation,” said Scott Spencer, Google’s head of product management for Google Ads.""So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited - but we will continue to do so for clear violations.”A decision to impose a global ban on political campaigns matching their own databases of prospective voters against Google's user base is set to have major ramifications ahead of next year's US Presidential election.Until now, strategists could use this to target individuals across platforms such as YouTube and Google Search.Based on a user’s browsing habits - such as what news websites they frequent - Google makes an assumption about whether that user has left- or right-leaning political views.In the US - but not in other countries, including the UK - political campaigns had the option to target people based on their political leaning.It was however possible for campaigns in other countries to upload their own lists of contact details - a database of party members, for example - to Google, which would then match it with users on its service so ads could reach those people directly.This will no longer be allowed.""It will take some time to implement these changes,” Mr Spencer added.Campaigns, like any other advertiser, can still place ads against specific types of content - such as videos about football or articles on the economy - Google said.Any action taken against advertising deemed to be against its polices will be logged on Google’s Transparency Report section.Details about deleted ads will appear on the page, but not the advertisement itself. Google said this data would remain downloadable so it could be independently analysed.Political advertising makes up a relatively small amount of Google’s total advertising revenues, which totalled $116bn in 2018.Since March 2019, for example, Google’s figures suggest just £171,250 has been spent on political advertising ads within the UK.In the US, campaigns have spent $128m on Google ads since the firm started publishing data on the region in May 2018.The biggest spender, the “Trump Make America Great Again Committee”, has spent $8.5m on Google since that date.Update 21 November: This article has been changed to reflect the fact in the UK and EU, Google already prevents political parties from targeting ads to users' based on their political views. The original version was based on a blog from the company that incorrectly suggested it would only begin enforcing the rule in the UK within a week and the EU by the end of the year._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Will fibre broadband be obsolete by 2030 - and what about 5G?	What is full-fibre broadband?How fast is full-fibre?Will full-fibre be obsolete in 2030?Why invest in fibre rather than 5G?	"Labour has promised to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030 if it wins the general election.The plan would see millions more properties given access to a full-fibre connection, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"".If the plan went ahead and was completed on time, would it still be useful in 2030?There are three main types of broadband connection that link the local telephone exchange to your home or office:The old landline telephone infrastructure across the UK used copper cables, but accessing the internet over copper cables is slower than over fibre optic cables.Fibre optic cables are made from glass or plastic and use pulses of light to transmit data, offering much faster internet access.Full-fibre broadband refers to an FTTP connection: the entire line from the telephone exchange to your home uses fibre optic cables.Currently, the UK government defines superfast broadband as having speeds greater than 30 megabits per second (Mbps). Megabits per second is the standard measurement of internet speed.Ultrafast is defined as a speed greater than 100Mbps.A connection using both fibre and copper (FTTC) can reach speeds of about 66Mbps.But a full-fibre connection (FTTP) - with no copper - can offer much faster average speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbps) - that's 1,000Mbps.Full-fibre can also deliver very low latency: that means less delay between sending a request and getting a response.That is not just important for video gamers. Low latency connections promise new opportunities for remote work, especially in fast-paced industries that cannot afford delays.There are other types of very fast connection as well. Virgin Media uses a different type of cable for the last section that comes into your house, which in theory can offer speeds of up to 10Gbps.There is also a service called G.fast, which uses a special pod to boost the speed of the standard copper cable connection.Predicting what the future holds for technology is obviously difficult.But full-fibre broadband, where ultra-fast optical cables carry data right into your home or office, is currently the ""gold standard"".""There is no doubt that we need fibre connectivity, in particular all the way to the home. That's something everybody is on board with across the industry and political parties,"" said Matthew Howett, an analyst at Assembly Research.While full-fibre connections can currently promise speeds of one gigabit per second, future upgrades could potentially offer speeds in terabits per second. (One terabit equals 1,000 gigabits.)That could be made possible by replacing the equipment at either end of the cables - in the telephone exchange and at home - without laying new cables.If, come 2030, there is a new emerging technology and countries are thinking about replacing their full-fibre systems, the UK would start on the same footing.Wireless connections can be a useful way to connect remote homes to the internet, but 5G may not be the answer for sparsely populated areas.5G networks can operate on several different frequencies, but the higher frequencies do not penetrate buildings and trees as well as the lower frequencies.Using those high frequencies requires many more transmitters, closer to the homes and offices that need internet access.And those so-called nano-masts are typically connected to the internet backbone by fibre.""Investing in fibre improves both fixed line services and helps to support connecting the many new nano-masts needed for 5G at its highest speeds,"" said Andrew Ferguson from the news site Thinkbroadband.com.However, the government plans to auction lower-frequency spectrum - freed up from the digital TV switchover - for 5G services.""The 700MHz frequency band that will be auctioned is good at covering large rural areas,"" said Mr Howett.""Anything freed up from that switchover from analogue to digital TV means you can reach more people with fewer base stations.""However, even if the UK focused on national 5G coverage, guaranteeing a stable connection to every home would be difficult.Atmospheric conditions can lead to variation in latency with wireless connections.""The problem with the final leg still being wireless is easily illustrated by the problems people have with existing wi-fi,"" said Mr Ferguson.""People often find they cannot cover their whole home without additional wireless repeaters.""And in the worst case scenario, a double decker bus could park between you and the lamp post across the street.""Full-fibre into the building technically gives a much better experience and avoids the variables that 5G cannot always overcome."""
technology	UK 'leading world' in compassionate technology	Dream role'A lot of courage'Combating loneliness'Stratospheric growth'	"The UK technology sector grew 2.6 times faster than the UK economy as a whole last year, new figures show. One of the biggest growth areas was in compassionate tech, with new apps and online services helping society's most vulnerable.""I ended up sofa surfing from place to place, so I didn't really have anywhere [of my own],"" 27-year-old Davina tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.She has been homeless for seven years.""It can affect your mood a lot, because you don't have a personal space that's yours.""I had no direction whatsoever,"" she says.But now Davina has hope of a different life.She is training to become an accountant, thanks to funding raised through compassionate technology - a thriving UK sector in which private start-ups are using tech to provide health and welfare services for those most in need.For Davina - whose surname we are not using - it was a company known as Beam.Beam approaches homeless charities, creates a plan for people to get their dream role, and then uses social media to match sponsors to individual campaigns.And there is no shortage of people signing up.Beam has thousands of sponsors pledging anything from £5 to £2000, which so far has got 30 people into jobs.Davina's campaign was funded in just nine days, raising £2,320.""There are people out there I don't even know, who are willing to support me. So it feels great,"" she says.One of those who supported her was David Gordon, from north London.The accountant was one of her biggest funders, after Davina's story resonated with him.""I was thinking it was tough enough for me [to become an accountant], so for you to do it in the face of adversity - you've got a lot of courage,"" he tells her, as they meet for the first time.He was also full of praise for Beam.""I thought it was a great concept and innovative way of helping people get over the line,"" he says.Currently Beam takes £1 in every £10 that is funded, to run its operation.But its founder, Alex Stephany, wants this to change.""We hope [in the future] this is a service the government will fund, as that will allow us to help as many people as possible,"" he says.""That will also allow us to save money for taxpayers, because at the moment homelessness is a very expensive problem the taxpayer is bearing the brunt of.""The UK has more investments in compassionate technology companies than the rest of Europe put together, data from Public - which supports industry start-ups - suggests.These companies are part of a sector estimated to be worth about £7bn, more than the financial tech sector - the new services such as current account apps disrupting traditional banking.And the UK technology industry as a whole grew by 4.5% between 2016 and 2017, according to a Tech Nation report released today.This is nearly three times the rate of UK gross domestic product (GDP), the amount the economy produces, which grew by 1.8% during the same period.Another area where compassionate technology is growing is in combating loneliness in older people.Technology is often designed for younger users, with touchscreens often failing to work for older users with dry hands, leaving them unable to communicate with others as easily.""I find with my mobile, I have to sit down very carefully and do all this business,"" says 84-year-old Marian, from Bromley. ""I can't do what the children do.""But now she has a high-resolution screen, called Komp, controlled with a single dial.It allows her to connect with her grandchildren, who can update it remotely with fresh pictures.Karen Dolva, head of the company No Isolation that's behind the product, says: ""We've been forcing tech made for millennials on to seniors, and it doesn't work.""You can't give them something that is just altered [for older people], you have to start over.""Compassionate technology is already embedded within some state public services.One example is GP at Hand, which allows you to book an appointment with an NHS doctor on your smartphone within two hours.Currently available only in the capital - it's intended to take the strain off demand for GP services, and means dropping your existing local GP and going to one of three central London surgeries if you are asked to see someone in person.There is criticism, however, from some charities that compassionate tech should not be needed, if support from public services was there in the first place.But this is disputed by Margot James MP, the minister for digital and creative industries.""I think we all need to play our part in resolving these problems and giving people hope,"" she says.""The public sector and government do not have a monopoly on ideas about how to help people in need"".However it is funded, the industry has seen ""stratospheric growth"" in recent years, according to Max Chambers from Public.He believes many former care workers are driving the change, and praises the tech companies' ability to tackle issues such as social care, loneliness, mental health and financial exclusion.""These start-ups mark the dawn of a new compassionate tech,"" he says.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel."
technology	Tech Tent: the technology of pleasure		"When it comes to sex tech, the gadgets that grab the headlines tend to be the sex robots, with their exaggeratedly feminine shapes and artificially intelligent responses to desire.But the market extends beyond these devices, and one British firm is seeking to challenge the stereotype.Stephanie Alys, co-founder of Mystery Vibe, describes her firm's product, the Crescendo vibrator, as a luxury sex toy. With a $180 price tag - £139 in the UK - it's certainly not cheap.It's a silicon-encased device which can be bent into a number of shapes. It can be controlled via a phone app and features wireless charging.It's app-powered, but in this age of fierce debate about data privacy and protection, is this most personal of data for sharing?There is no log-in to the Mystery Vibe app and no data is collected, says Stephanie Alys - although she admits she can see the potential for data analytics in the future.""If we put sensors in the silicon that understood indications of arousal, if you understood what turned one person on .... you could start to create content for them, maybe visual content through their smart TV, or even interact with other objects in their smart home - their smart heating, their smart lighting to create a very immersive experience,"" she said.But is the consumer ready for that?""I'm having a hard time imagining getting aroused while knowing that my toy is recording information about me and talking to the other connecting devices in my house,"" said Kashmir Hill from Gizmodo.She recalled the story of Canadian firm WeVibe, which collected all kinds of data about how its sex toy was being used - but neglected to inform its customers that it was doing so.The firm argued that the data helped it to improve its product - but still faced legal action as a result."
technology	Entire drone fleet grounded by US government agency	Full control	"More than 800 drones have been grounded by the US Department of the Interior (DoI) over concerns they could be used to aid Chinese spying.All the grounded drones were made in China or use Chinese parts, the Wall Street Journal reports.The call to stop using the autonomous craft was made by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who also ordered a review of the security risks they pose.Only drones helping in emergencies will be allowed to fly.The Department of the Interior uses drones extensively to look after federal territories and manages the nation's natural resources.Drones help keep an eye on dams, inspect land, monitor environmental damage and endangered species. They also help emergency workers manage wildfires, floods and other natural disasters.The memo from Mr Bernhardt said a decision about whether the drones could be used again would be made once the security investigation had been completed.Technology news website The Verge reported the agency was concerned the drones could transmit images and video to China about key installations, which may leave them open to future attacks.American politicians are currently debating a bill that would stop government bodies and agencies buying Chinese made or developed drones.The DoI action follows a warning issued in May by the country's Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency. In a memo, it said the US had ""strong concerns"" about the growing number of Chinese drones used by government agencies.Soon after, drone-maker DJI, which has a 70% share of the US market, said customers had ""full and complete control"" over what was done with the data its craft gathered.In August 2017, the US Army prohibited troops from using DJI's drones, because of unspecified cyber-security concerns.The decision is part of a larger US government push to limit how much Chinese technology is used in America.As well as trade tariffs, this action has also involved stopping Chinese telecoms giant Huawei operating in the US."
technology	Amazon Alexa gets Samuel L Jackson and other celebrity voices	Smart speaker shipmentsSound boostPrivacy worries	"Amazon has announced that its virtual assistant Alexa will soon be able to mimic the voice of the actor Samuel L Jackson among other celebrities.The firm intends to charge a fee for the feature, with each voice costing $0.99 (80p).The company has also refreshed its range of Echo speakers, adding a larger high-end version with Dolby Atmos for ""3D sound"".Amazon is the world's best-selling smart speaker brand.However, that position is being challenged by Chinese companies including Baidu, while Google is also expected to unveil new gear of its own next month.The company has also extended its Echo range into a selection of wearable tech for both humans and pets for the first time.The new devices include:In addition, the firm said its smart assistant would be built into General Motors' vehicles from next year, and that some existing models could be upgraded to include the feature.""This avalanche of new products underlines Amazon's desire to extend Alexa's reach to every part of people's lives - be that in the home, or on the move via new Echo Buds or in the car through the deal with General Motors,"" commented Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight.""Not only will it will strengthen Amazon's reach with existing customers that use Alexa-powered products, it will also provide the opportunity to woo more consumers to embrace its increasingly ubiquitous voice assistant.""Amazon said it would use a ""neural text-to-speech"" engine to mimic celebrities' voices on Alexa-powered devices. It will use recordings the stars provide as the basis for other computer-generated utterances.In the case of Avengers actor Samuel L Jackson, consumers will be given the choice of whether they want a version that swears or not.The firm said other famous stars - who will be paid for their services - will follow.Amazon recently announced it was upgrading its music streaming service to a ""high definition"" format to help its fortunes.Its new Studio speaker should provide users with a means to appreciate the extra detail it offers. Like Sonos' kit, it fine tunes its sound to suit the acoustics of the room it is placed in.And two of the $200 (£190 in the UK) speakers can be paired and connected to a Fire TV stick or television to create a home theatre experience.""Amazon has never really had a smart speaker which was marketed specifically for its audio quality, in the manner of an Apple HomePod or a Google Home Max,"" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys.""Typically, third-parties like Harman and Sonos would be the ones to differentiate in this space on Amazon's behalf.""If it [lives up to its promise], it will cannibalise these third-party products, and leave little room left for third-party smart speaker vendors to innovate.""Amazon's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, while shares in Sonos sank 5% lower.Amazon's devices chief Dave Limp addressed users' privacy concerns early on during the launch event at the firm's Seattle headquarters, even showing a tweet it had received complaining about one of its speakers activating without the trigger word ""Alexa"" being uttered.""We care about this,"" he said.""Privacy is absolutely foundational to everything we do in and around Alexa.""He highlighted the fact that users can now command a device to delete everything they have said that day. In addition, the firm recently added an option to its Alexa app to let users opt out of having their voices transcribed by humans to improve the service's accuracy.However, some of its rivals - including Apple and Google - have gone further by requiring their users to opt in to similar programmes.""Privacy is a huge issue for all technology manufacturers and recent revelations show that Amazon is vulnerable,"" commented Adam Simon from the market intelligence firm Context.""All our research shows that it is a major concern to consumers.""Yet, ironically, it is not the most important barrier preventing people buying smart home products. Privacy is far outweighed by lack of understanding, lack of perception of value, and lack of good use cases.""He added that later this year, users will be able to ask Alexa ""why did you do that?"", to question it about unexpected behaviour.Furthermore, a new setting will allow them to set recordings to be auto-deleted after a set period of time ranging from three to 18 months.Other announcements included a new 8in (20.3cm) Echo Show smart display, which can now show group video calls with several people on-screen at once.It features the same ""high definition"" screen resolution as the 10in model, but only a one megapixel camera versus the 5MP sensor in the larger device.That means it will likely never add the kind of auto-framing feature that Facebook's Portal and Google Nest Hub Max video chat devices offer, which is achieved by cropping into the image.Other new kit included:Mr Limp also announced changes to its Ring-branded smart doorbells.These will now gain use of Alexa, including a service that will allow visitors to record a message if the owner is out and unable to answer remotely via the device's app.He also unveiled new Ring hardware including a security camera for inside the home - which will compete against Google's Nest Cam as well as similar products from Hive and Canary - and a ""retrofit"" kit that adds smart features to existing alarm systems."
technology	Netflix to disappear on older Samsung smart TVs		"Samsung has announced that Netflix will no longer be supported on some of its older smart TVs.From 1 December, the Netflix app will no longer work on some 2010 and 2011 models due to ""technical limitations"".Seven older Roku streaming sticks will also no longer support Netflix from December, Roku told Digital Trends.Netflix can be watched on smart TVs, set-top boxes, streaming media players and video consoles. Users can check if their devices are compatible here.""Samsung was recently notified by Netflix that as of 1 December, the Netflix app will no longer be supported on selected 2010 and 2011 Smart TV models sold in Canada and the US,"" Samsung said in a statement.""For consumers with these models, there are still many other devices supported by Netflix that can be connected to a Smart TV in order to access the app.""Jim Martin, editor of tech reviews website Tech Advisor, says consumers should check whether any of the other devices they own can be used to access Netflix.""It's partly the price of being an early adopter,"" he told the BBC. ""Technology moves quite quickly and nothing lasts forever.""He added that people who want to keep accessing streaming services on their existing smart TV could plug in a streaming stick.Roku said the older streaming stick models that would no longer support Netflix included the Roku 2050X, Roku 2100X, Roku 2000C, Roku HD Player, Roku SD Player, Roku XR Player and Roku XD Player."
technology	Can Valve tempt gamers to try virtual reality?	First, some historyIs the new game Half-Life 3?Why is it only available in VR?What can we expect from the game?Who will play it?	"Game developer Valve has announced a new title in its well-known Half-Life series of games.The next one, called Half-Life: Alyx, will be available in March 2020. More details are due to be released later this week.Gamers not born when Half-Life was released in 1998 may not be aware of the hold it, and its various follow-ups, have on older players.Half-life rejuvenated the first-person shooter by injecting it with much needed realism, a strong story and a memorable hero in Gordon Freeman. The potent combination made it hugely successful and it is widely regarded as one of the best games ever made.The love affair continued with Half-Life 2, released in November 2004, which introduced a detailed world with realistic physics that players could exploit, via the game's gravity gun, to solve puzzles or defeat enemies. It too regularly tops lists of best games.Valve has released extra episodes for Half-Life 2 but those who cut their gaming teeth on the two titles have eagerly awaited the third instalment.Online, every hint about HL3 that has surfaced over the last 15 years has been dissected and pored over by fans.Not quite. Ars Technica reports that it will be set after the first game and before the second. A sequel to one and prequel to the other.Half-Life: Alyx is an entirely new game only playable via virtual reality. Valve has helped develop the Vive VR headset with HTC but it said the game would also work on the Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality VR systems.As its name suggests, the game will focus on Alyx Vance - one of the main characters in Half-Life 2.The original game introduced an alien technological superpower called the Combine that, once it was unleashed on Earth by Gordon Freeman, conquered the planet in a few hours.Alyx's father, Dr Eli Vance, became head of the resistance fighting the Combine's malign control, so it is reasonable to assume that the game will deal with the early days of the fightback.Valve has a history of pushing the boundaries in PC gaming and Half-Life: Alyx continues that trend.In addition, Valve has a vested interest in getting people to try, and buy, Vive headsets. The basic Vive model costs £499 in the UK, $399 in the US, and the higher-spec models in the range cost a good deal more.That high starting price for VR gaming means only really dedicated, older fans have tried it.In addition, many of the games available to play in VR have been titles that would do as well on a flat screen.If Valve manages to make Half-Life: Alyx an immersive VR experience that exploits the possibilities of the technology it could mean new gamers give it a try, said industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit.""A Half-Life VR game will definitely increase consumer interest and awareness of the tech, and result in a bump in sales of PC-based VR headsets,"" he said.He doubts it will fuel an ""explosive"" surge in VR sales simply because the cost of a headset, and a PC to power it, is so high.Valve has remained tight-lipped but there are hints about one aspect of the gameplay.In September, a leak from Valve's core gaming software suggested it was working on a novel control system called ""grabbity gloves"".These will allow players to point to, attract and control distant objects - a bit like the force powers the Jedi use. The world in Half-Life: Alyx will probably be very responsive and open to manipulation via VR controllers.Good question. The gaming world has moved on enormously since HL1 and 2. Valve is still widely influential thanks to its Steam gaming platform and other titles such as Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, Left 4 Dead and Portal.But players' attention is now divided between massively multiplayer games such as Fortnite, League of Legends, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, Overwatch and many, many others.For many of these people, the arrival of Half-Life: Alyx may be too little, too late to tempt them into donning a headset and taking on the Combine."
technology	Microsoft warns firms of technology 'distractions'	"""Technostress"""	"Technology can distract workers rather than make them more productive, suggests a survey carried out by software giant Microsoft.Many of the 20,000 European workers questioned said a steady stream of emails, messages and notifications kept them from concentrating.Others said the way their employer deployed technology also stopped them being more productive.One expert said many staff suffered high levels of technostress.The report, which sampled views in 21 European nations including the UK, found that only 11.4% of European workers said they felt highly productive.""Modern workers have an abundance of technology at their fingertips,"" said the report. ""But this availability doesn't necessarily translate into impact.""Endless amounts of updates and notifications arriving via social media made people less productive, said the report, as did other factors connected to technology.Microsoft pointed to the dangers of ""constant connectivity"" which brought with it the expectation that staff would respond at all hours to messages and other requests.These ""flexible working"" regimes many firms adopted often came with the assumption that people who worked longer hours would would be more productive.The software firm's findings suggest that a company's ""digital culture"" could improve workers' productivity and help them feel more involved.Digital culture covered the way a company viewed and used technology, it said. This involved organisations knowing what they wanted to do with the software and systems they adopted and also giving staff the proper training and other help to use it.It pointed to a number of ""supporting conditions"" that let people get the most out of technology. These covered everything from appropriate email response times to measuring if people were happy with the tech they used to do their day-to-day jobs.In those companies that reported having a strong digital culture about 22% of employees felt highly productive, said the report. That strong sense of how technology helps also reduced the number of staff that felt disengaged to about 8%. By contrast, in companies where technology was not managed well about 20% felt disengaged.""It's the unintended consequences you have to think through when you deploy technology,"" said Sir Cary Cooper, a professor of organisational psychology at the Manchester Business School who has written extensively on the technostress staff can suffer.""We do not want to throw the technology out because it's very good for communications, but we have not developed good guidelines on what counts as productive use of it,"" he said.""There's a whole field now called 'technostress' in management science,"" Sir Cary told the BBC, saying that it dealt with the adverse consequences of adopting novel computer systems or software.""Technologies can overload people and make them less productive because they get caught up in it rather than use it to deliver a service or a product.""Sir Cary said email had been named as the ""second most damaging issue"" by big firms who were members of the UK's National Forum for Health and Wellbeing at Work, that he helped to co-ordinate.Acknowledging this, many firms now limited when emails can be sent in a bid to lighten the load on workers, he said.""Productivity comes from creative interchange,"" he said. ""It does not come from people sitting in front of machines sending emails."""
technology	Google makes deepfakes to fight deepfakes	Fake Zuck	"Google has released a database of 3,000 deepfakes - videos that use artificial intelligence to alter faces or to make people say things they never did.The videos are of actors and use a variety of publicly available tools to alter their faces.The search giant hopes it will help researchers build the tools needed to take down ""harmful"" fake videos.There are fears such videos could be used to promote false conspiracy theories and propaganda.Deepfake technology takes video and audio clips of real people, often politicians or celebrities, and uses artificial-intelligence techniques to alter them in some way, for instance putting words in their mouth or transposing their head on to body of an actor in pornography.Since their first appearance in 2017, many open-source methods of generating deepfake clips have emerged.In a blogpost, describing its work, Google said: ""Since the field is moving quickly, we'll add to this dataset as deepfake technology evolves over time and we'll continue to work with partners in this space.""We firmly believe in supporting a thriving research community around mitigating potential harms from misuses of synthetic media.""While many are likely intended to be humorous, others could be harmful to individuals and society.""The database will be incorporated into work to combat deepfakes, at the Technical University of Munich and the University of Naples Federico II .The universities have created a similar database using four common face-manipulation techniques on nearly 1,000 YouTube videos.It is hoped both these databases will be used to train automated detection tools to spot fakery.Earlier this month, Facebook announced it had set up a $10m (£8.1m) fund to find better ways to detect deepfakes.Its own chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been a victim of such trickery, when a manipulated video appeared to show him credit a secretive organisation for the success of the social network.Deepfake technology hit the headlines in 2017, when University of Washington researchers released a paper describing how they had created a fake video of President Barack Obama.One of the researchers, Dr Supasorn Suwajanakorn, later defended his invention, in a Ted talk, while admitting the technology had the potential for misuse."
technology	TED 2018: Technology reveals fear and other emotions		"The fear levels of an audience have been measured to show how machines are beginning to reveal people's deepest feelings.The demonstration was part of a talk given by Dolby Labs chief scientist Poppy Crum at the TED conference in Vancouver.The ability to hide emotions is becoming ""a thing of the past"", she said.The professor believes this could usher in an era of empathetic technology.""We like to believe we have cognitive control over what someone else knows, sees, understands about our own internal states - our emotions, insecurities, bluffs or trials and tribulations,"" she explained.""But technologies can already distinguish a real smile from a fake one.""She added that this went far beyond recording people's actions via a camera or microphone. To demonstrate this, she revealed that the carbon dioxide her audience was exhaling was being monitored.""There are tubes in the theatre - lower to the ground since CO2 is heavier than air,"" she explained.""They're connected to a machine that lets us measure with high precision the continuous differential concentration of carbon dioxide.""Prof Crum then showed a real-time data-visualisation, outlining the changes in the density of the gas in the room as larger and deeper coloured clouds.""It takes about 20 to 30 seconds for the CO2 from your reactions to reach the machine. You can see where some of us jumped as a deep red cloud. It's our collective suspense creating a spike in CO2,"" she said.In her day job at Dolby Labs, the neurophysiologist has spent the last few years studying people watch movies.Willing volunteers are hooked up to electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, heart rate monitors, thermal imaging cameras and skin response sensors in order to observe the biophysical and emotional response that humans experience while watching videos.""The dynamics of our thermal signature give away changes in how hard our brains are working, how engaged or excited we might be in the conversation we are having, and even whether we're reacting to an image of fire as if it were real,"" she said.""We can actually see people giving off heat on their cheeks just looking at a picture of flame.""In the future Prof Crum thinks that similar tech could improve people's daily lives.Hearing aids might identify when the wearer is stressed and alter volumes. Personal assistants in the home could pick up on the owner's mood. And sensors could make teachers aware when pupils are struggling to understand a lesson.Speech analysis technologies are already being developed to provide insights into people's mental and physical health, Prof Crum added. She gave three examples:In an era when many are considering cutting down their digital footprint, Prof Crum urged the opposite approach.""If we share more data with transparency and effective regulations, it can help create empathetic technologies that can respond in a more human way that improves our lives,"" she said."
technology	Facebook to use Met Police videos to recognise shooters		"Facebook is to use footage from police body cameras to train its algorithms to recognise videos of real-life shootings.The technology giant will give the cameras to Metropolitan Police Specialist Firearms Command officers.It will then capture footage as they carry out regular training.Facebook was criticised for failing to prevent copies of videos of the Christchurch mosque shootings from being shared on its platform.The announcement came the day before Facebook and other tech firms will face questions from US senators about their efforts to identify and remove violent content from their platforms.""We did not have enough content depicting first-person footage of violent events to effectively train our machine learning technology,"" it said in a blog.The Metropolitan Police said it was ""happy to help"" develop the technology.""Technology that automatically stops livestreaming of attacks once identified, would also significantly help prevent the glorification of such acts and the promotion of the toxic ideologies that drive them,"" assistant commissioner for specialist operations Neil Basu said.But one artificial intelligence researcher said it could take many years for the project to come to fruition.""This is definitely a difficult problem and I don't see Facebook solving it soon,"" explained Christopher Tegho, a software engineer who specialises in video understanding.""I guess it could be helpful for Facebook to be able to gather more data from something that is close to a real first-person shooter video to help train its models.""But we are still not close to the same accuracy levels at being able to recognise what is going on in the scene of a video as we are to recognising what is in a still image.""Facebook also said it had:""In March, we started connecting people who search for terms associated with white supremacy on Facebook Search to resources focused on helping people leave behind hate groups,"" it said."
technology	Live facial recognition surveillance 'must stop'	'Surveillance crisis'Legal actionIntercept terrorists	"UK police and companies must stop using live facial recognition for public surveillance, politicians and campaigners have said.The technology allows faces captured on CCTV to be checked in real time against watch lists, often compiled by police.Privacy campaigners say it is inaccurate, intrusive and infringes on an individual's right to privacy.But its makers say it helps protect the public as it can catch people like terror suspects in a way police cannot.The Home Office said it supported the police ""as they trial new technologies to protect the public, including facial recognition, which helps them identify and locate suspects and criminals"".A letter, written by privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, has been signed by more than 18 politicians, including David Davis, Diane Abbott, Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas. Twenty-five campaign groups including Amnesty International and Liberty, plus academics and barristers also signed.They argue facial recognition is being adopted in the UK before it has been properly scrutinised by politicians.The director of Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""What we're doing is putting this to government to say: 'Please can we open this debate and have this conversation.""'But for goodness sake, while it is going on, there is now a surveillance crisis on our hands that needs to be stopped urgently'.""The Kings Cross estate has recently been at the centre of controversy, when it was revealed its owners were using facial recognition technology without telling the public.It then emerged both the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police had supplied the company with images for their database. Both had initially denied involvement.South Wales Police was taken to the High Court over its trial of the technology, by a man who was caught on camera. The court ruled it was lawful, although that is now being appealed against.Researchers have raised concerns that some systems are vulnerable to bias, as they are more likely to misidentify women and darker-skinned people.Areeq Chowdhury, head of the Future Advocacy think tank, said this was due to things like colour contrasts on people of colour and systems being confused by cosmetics, while some systems have not been trained with enough diverse datasets of people from different demographics.""You could see a situation where you are identifying innocent individuals who are from a particular minority. Which means they'll be questioned by the police even though they're innocent and they may even have their details and picture captured on record, despite having committed no crime,"" he said.Digital Barriers, a worldwide supplier of the technology, says facial recognition is an essential tool for counter-terrorism.Its CEO, Zak Doffman, said: ""Imagine I know there is a group of individuals in central London that want to do harm on a massive scale to the public. Would you have public support to use facial recognition to try and intercept that group of individuals before they can do harm? I would suggest almost categorically you would.""He added that he did not support indiscriminate use of the technology.""I'll give you the opposite example, an individual has been kicked out of the pub for drinking too much on a Saturday night. The pub has taken a photo of that individual, should they then be prevented from getting into that establishment or other establishments because of that incident? I think you'll have very little public consent for that example.""Unfortunately there's no clarity. There's no regulation that governs either case and that is the challenge.""The UK Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter, says there must be a set of strict standards governing how the technology is used, before it is formally adopted by police forces.""There should be a standard around its siting, efficiency and effectiveness,"" he explained. ""I suppose you might say, 'What is an appropriate force hit-rate that is tolerable against the totality?' There needs to be a lot more assurance to the public that any notion of bias through ethnic background is eradicated.""The Home Office said it welcomed a recent judgment confirming ""there is a clear and sufficient legal framework for the use of live facial recognition technology in the UK"".It added the technology had demonstrated the ability to tackle crime and identify criminals in an efficient way that would not otherwise be possible.Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
technology	Disney bets the House of Mouse on streaming	‘Kingdom-wide’ advertisingSelf-disrupt	"There’s no question Disney produces incredible entertainment. The firm has had us laughing, crying and falling in love with its characters for almost 100 years.But the launch of its eagerly-anticipated streaming service Disney+ - which goes live in the US, Canada and the Netherlands on Tuesday - will mean the legendary House of Mouse will need to be able to compete not just on programming, but technology too.""We're making a huge statement about the future of media and entertainment and our continued ability to thrive in this new era,” chief executive Bob Iger said on a call with his shareholders last week.They’d just been informed of a 66% drop in profits, and a 50% rise in costs, mostly attributed to the move to streaming. Creating the Disney+ platform has been, and will continue to be, a hugely costly exercise - with no guarantee the rewards will ever materialise.On the tech side, in 2017 the firm spent $1.58bn (£1.22bn) - in addition to $1bn it had already invested - to gain control of BamTech, a Manhattan-based streaming media specialist that previously helped US broadcaster HBO set up its streaming services.To make sure it has a strong enough library, Disney has been on an unprecedented acquisition spree that has made it into the world’s largest media company.It included a $71.3bn deal to snap up 21st Century Fox, which included the 20th Century Fox studio, National Geographic, a large stake in pre-existing streaming service Hulu, and TV channel FX - giving Disney exclusive rights to stream The Simpsons, among other things.And perhaps the biggest draw on launch day will be The Mandalorian, a live-action Star Wars series exclusive to Disney+, reportedly created at a cost of more than $100m.Having exclusive streaming rights to Star Wars, Marvel and The Simpsons - not to mention complete control of its own lucrative creations, like Frozen - will make Disney+ a major competitor to Netflix, Amazon and others overnight.But that alone won’t be enough to recoup the tens of billions of dollars in investment.Disney has estimated that before the effort can break even, it needs in the region of 60 to 90 million monthly subscribers. Netflix - which has had a 12-year headstart - currently has 61 million paying customers globally.Media industry analysts MoffettNathanson predict Disney+ will attract some 8 million paid subscribers by the end of this calendar year, thanks to aggressive marketing and a deal with Verizon that will see some of its customers given free access to Disney+.The Verizon arrangement is a direct attempt to fight Apple’s decision to give away a free year of its service, Apple TV+, when a person buys a new Apple device.And, if anyone knows how to market itself, it’s Disney.The New York Times has referred to efforts to promote Disney+ as a “kingdom-wide” onslaught: Anchors on local TV stations owned by Disney will reference the launch; staff in Disney’s retail stores will wear t-shirts; buses at theme parks will promote the exclusive shows.During a time-out in Monday’s Seattle v San Francisco American Football game, commentators on ESPN - owned by Disney - mused how The Mandalorian would be “huge” for their families. An exclusive clip from the series was shown during the half-time show.In October, in an effort to promote pre-orders, Disney’s social media team posted a thread of “basically everything” that will be available on the service on launch day (around 500 films and 7,000 TV episodes). Independent estimates have suggested that there may have been as many as 2 million sign-ups before launch.The global launch of Disney+ will be fragmented, however, with much of the world having to wait to get the service due to legacy deals that are still in place.The UK, for example, will get Disney+ in March, although it's still not clear exactly how full its library will be as Sky is believed to have ongoing deals to stream some of Disney's content up until 2021.Disney has said it will have clawed back all of its content rights globally by the end of the same year.Disney’s move to streaming, and having direct access to its audience, will be the legacy of Mr Iger, who took over as chief executive in 2005. He announced in April that he would be stepping down at the end of his contract in 2021.Having the ability to sell its product directly via Disney+, rather than through cable companies or cinemas, brings vast new opportunities - not least because the firm will have access to data on its customer’s habits, data it can use to market merchandise and make decisions about future programming.But to realise that long-term ambition, Disney will be upended.Investors are excited about that future. Despite the sharp drop in profits, Disney has in fact exceeded Wall Street expectations: The firm’s share price is up by around 17% compared to this time last year. It’s up 29% since June 2017, when Mr Iger is said to have committed to the decision to go all-in on streaming.“Rarely has a company willingly created this much financial disruption in strategically pivoting to a new business model,” said MoffettNathanson.That’s not to say it’s a difficult choice for Mr Iger to make, though.In March, the Motion Picture Association of America released a startling statistic. For the first time, there were a greater number of Americans subscribing to a streaming service than to traditional cable.The inevitability of that shift didn't make it any less seismic: Television had entered a new era, and film will follow. These changes may be expensive, but Disney certainly can’t afford to waste any time._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Phone case created out of artificial skin		"A team of researchers has built a prototype phone case that mimics human skin.A video released by team members shows them using it to control a handset by pinching, squeezing and prodding it to zoom in or out, and carry out other functions.It could also be used in the future to interact with a virtual avatar.Project leader Marc Teyssier said he understood why some people found it creepy.""I do think it's creepy - I get it,"" he told the BBC.""We are not used to human touch on objects. This project has made people reflect on what technology is and why this is creepy.""Tickling the skin on the back of the phone could release a laughing emoji in a message, for example, while a pinch could result in an expression of anger.Writing on the project website, Mr Teyssier said the ""cold interface"" of a smartphone ""doesn't allow natural interaction and input"".The skin consists of two different forms of silicone layers, and electrodes attached to a hardware controller.Mr Teyssier told New Scientist that getting the right balance of materials was difficult.""The constraint was to develop something that was stretchable and that can also detect touch,"" he said.He also said that make-up or paint could be used in order to ""increase anthropomorphism"".There are no plans to market the case, although Mr Teyssier has published how it was made.""Anyone can reproduce it,"" he said.The materials are mass-produced and each unit would cost less than £5 to build, he estimated.The team also adapted it to fit other portable electronics, such as a smart watch, companion robot, and laptop launchpad.On social media it has been greeted with a degree of fascination and horror, with many agreeing that the Skin-On case was decidedly ""creepy"".""This is profoundly wrong and I want one immediately,"" tweeted lecturer Belinda Barnet.The research paper on ""Skin-On interfaces"" has been published at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, taking place in Louisiana."
technology	Tech 2017: BBC News Online's biggest technology stories		"For many, 2017 will be defined by fake news and the fight-back against it.Others will point to the blog that uncovered sexism and sexual harassment at Uber, helping force the resignation of the ride-hailing firm's founder and paving the way for other controversies to be uncovered.Gamers may prefer instead to celebrate Nintendo's revival thanks to its Switch console, and motorists to highlight Elon Musk's desire to electrify the trucking industry.But you, BBC Tech's readers, focused your attention elsewhere - at least as far as our figures on what you clicked on suggest.Below are the stories you made most popular for each month of the year.January: Undesired dimensionThe quiet death of 3D TV was the first of the year's big stories.When Sony and LG unveiled their new television ranges at the CES Las Vegas tech expo, it soon became apparent none of the models supported the format.Samsung and Philips had already ditched the technology the previous year.Strictly speaking, 3D-on-the-home-screen wasn't totally extinct - Panasonic came out with a new set in February - but a combination of consumer apathy, frumpy glasses and uninterested streaming services had clearly doomed the extra dimension.With CES 2018 just around the corner, the question is whether we'll soon be able to call time on curved screens too.February: Nokia's retro relaunchHMD Global pulled off a marketing coup when it unveiled a new Nokia-branded 2G phone with the same name as one of the most iconic models of yesteryear.The ""reimagined"" 3310 featured the classic game Snake, offered extended battery life and kind of resembled the original design. But it lacked access to Snapchat, WhatsApp and countless other apps.Moreover, once owners got over the nostalgia factor, they discovered the photos it took were both pixelated and hard to get off the device.Even so, there was enough demand to justify a follow-up 3G model in September, and the phones appear to have helped raise the profile of other higher-end Nokia handsets.March: Watching the watchersAllegations that the CIA and MI5 had teamed up to hack Samsung TVs were made even juicier by the fact the project had apparently been given a Doctor Who-related codename.According to Wikileaks, the Weeping Angel attack caused compromised TVs to record audio when apparently switched off, before later uploading it to the cyberspies' computer servers.Effectively, it allowed a room to be bugged without producing giveaway radio signals.One theory for the project's name was that just like the malevolent sci-fi statues, the TVs were still ""alive"" even when they appeared to be inactive.Later in the year, Wikileaks published further details, including how the spyware could be uninstalled, as well as claims about other CIA-related hacking tools.April: Facebook and Google get scammedAlthough $100m (£76m) might seem like pocket change to Google and Facebook, the two companies missed the funds after they - and a third business, Quanta Computer - were allegedly conned by an email fraudster.The accused is said to have faked messages from an Asian-based manufacturer and convinced his victims to wire payments to his account over a three-year period.The Lithuanian suspect, Evaldas Rimasauskas, was extradited from his home country to New York later in the year where he now faces charges for wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft.He denies the allegations.May: WannaCry wreaks havocA common refrain with cyber-security alerts is that, despite there being a hullabaloo of expert opinions, there's typically little real impact to the public. WannaCry was the exception.The ransomware attack swept across the world locking out users from tens of thousands of Windows PCs. The assault - later blamed on North Korea - forced NHS trusts in England and Scotland to cancel operations and other appointments.It was subsequently revealed that they had ignored earlier government warnings to update their systems, which could have mitigated the problem.The one upside was that a British cyber-security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, managed to trigger a ""kill switch"", halting the attack prematurely. More on him in a bit...June: Ukraine attackJust a month after WannaCry, another hack attack caused chaos - and this time the damage proved to be longer-lasting. An infected tax software update sent to businesses in Ukraine spread worldwide, disrupting the operations of some of the world's biggest companies.They included shipping firm Maersk, delivery giant FedEx, advertising conglomerate WPP and the consumer goods-maker Reckitt Benckiser. In some cases it took months before operations returned to normal, and related losses totalling more than $1bn were declared.Ukraine accused Russia of being responsible, but the Kremlin denied involvement.A complicating factor in reporting the cyber-strike was that the security industry struggled to settle on a name for it - with Petya, NotPetya, Pneytna, Petrwrap, SortaPetya and Goldeneye among the variants suggested.July: Bitcoin's big momentBitcoin's future seemed in doubt when there were rival plans mid-year to tackle a slowdown in the amount of time taken to process transactions in the virtual currency.Without delving too deeply into the proposals - you can read up on Bip 91, Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit2x if you dare - a compromise deal was eventually struck to make the underlying technology, the blockchain, more efficient.But the plan fell apart before it had a chance to be fully enacted in November. That failure didn't prevent Bitcoin's value from bubbling higher. When the article in question was published, it was worth about $2,400 per coin.By December, it was close to $20,000.Slow processing times, however, remain a headache. Earlier this month, the average time taken to confirm a Bitcoin transaction was close to 24 hours.August: From hero to houndedMarcus Hutchins never wanted to be exposed as the ""Wannacry hack hero"" and his name only became public after British newspapers revealed him to be cyber-security blogger Malware Tech against his will.That act carried a vicious sting in its tail when the 23 year old was arrested by the FBI after a trip to Las Vegas.The US accused him of having developed banking malware several years ago and of selling it on dark web forums - charges Mr Hutchins denies.The accusations caused fury among other cyber-security professionals, with some vowing to restrict the support they offered the authorities.Mr Hutchins is currently released on bail in Los Angeles where he is awaiting trial.In the meantime, the Trump administration recently acknowledged that it was ""lucky"" Mr Hutchins had thwarted Wannacry, although it avoided mentioning him by name.September: iPhone X exposedCuriously, a major leak about Apple's iPhone X ahead of its official launch managed to attract more eyeballs to BBC Tech than the actual unveiling of the device itself.Details included the phone's name, the set-up process for its facial recognition technology and the inclusion of its animated emoji characters.An extra element of schadenfreude was provided for company critics by the fact that an earlier leak had disclosed that Apple had hired ex-FBI and NSA workers to thwart such spoilers.It's questionable whether the reveal actually dampened demand for the £1,000 handset.The US firm has forecast record sales for its current quarter. However, in recent days some analysts have begun to question how robust demand will be later in 2018.October: Amazon thieves bustedWhen a company gets to be Amazon's size it has to rely on automated systems to deal with items reported as damaged or missing by their intended recipients.A US couple thought that presented them with an opportunity. They used hundreds of fake identities to order gadgets from the online retailer, reported problems that triggered replacement deliveries, and then sold on all the goods for a profit.The $1.2m scale of their crime, however, meant their activity had in fact been detected and they eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering after being arrested.Erin Joseph Finan and his wife Leah Jeannette Finan were supposed to have been sentenced in November.But that has been delayed after they were accused of defrauding another internet retailer in the months after the original charges were filed.November: Rough start""The future is here,"" Navya's self-driving shuttle bus had emblazoned on its side as it launched its Las Vegas pick-up service.Unfortunately, less than an hour later, that future involved a delivery lorry backing into its front. As one passenger later recounted, the ""crash"" seemed to occur in slow-motion and only caused superficial damage. But the story sped across the world.Although the human driver was ultimately held responsible, the police report - made public earlier this month - told a more nuanced story.The trucker said they had turned on their hazard lights and sounded a back-up alarm to warn surrounding motorists that they were straightening up the cab.It had never occurred to them that an automated vehicle would respond by remaining stationary in their path without doing more to prevent the accident.December: Slowing downApple may have had the best of intentions, but its love of secrecy left even some of its biggest fans shaking their heads this time round.It was only after a blog by the makers of the Geekbench app went viral that the US firm publicly confirmed it had been deliberately slowing down ageing iPhones to help manage performance issues caused by their batteries wearing out.It subsequently emerged that the firm had apparently privately briefed some analysts on the decision a year ago, but had not shared the details with its consumers.Whether those customers would really have preferred thicker handsets with bigger or swappable batteries is open to debate.But the risk it faces is that shoppers suspect it is untrustworthy.At time of writing, Apple is being sued in eight separate cases in the US over the matter, as well as facing legal action in Israel."
technology	The obscure groups buying up Facebook election ads	Facebook ad spendSeen any political ads? Send them to us	"Two weeks into our election-ads project, the messages keep pouring in.We have seen adverts for all the main parties but what has been striking over recent days is the number of people who have sent us ads from obscure organisations.Ever heard of Working4UK, or Parents' Choice, or Right to Rent, Right to Buy, Right to Own?Probably not - and their names would tell you little about their political leanings.By contrast, it is not so hard to work out what the Campaign Against Corbynism is about.As it turns out, the four organisations are all hostile to Labour, without being explicit about which party they support, and appear to be targeting key seats where it might be vulnerable.One correspondent was shown ads by all four groups - and sent us examples.""Getting an extraordinary number of political attack ads aimed at Corbyn,"" he wrote.""I wonder if they are basing my political leanings (LibDem) to try to prevent me from voting Labour tactically in Crewe and Nantwich.""Last time round, Labour won that seat with a wafer-thin majority, while the Lib Dems came a distant third.But the contributor noted he lived about 50m (165ft) outside the constituency.Facebook gives users limited information about why they were selected, via its Why Am I Seeing This Ad pop-up.This includes more details than are available to the wider public via Facebook's Ad Library, which the technology company launched in the UK last year to make campaigning on its platform more ""transparent"".The pop-up revealed Right to Rent had been trying to reach ""people who Facebook thinks are interested in property"", matching its post's suggestion Labour was determined to tax private landlords.Parents' Choice's ad, attacking Labour's policy on private schools, was targeted at people ""interested in education, Boris Johnson and more"".And the Campaign Against Corbynism's post was directed at people over 35 ""who are interested in the Conservative Party"".So the latter two organisations were targeting people who might already be sympathetic to the Conservative cause.Perhaps they are focused on getting the core vote out rather than trying to win over Labour or Liberal Democrat supporters.When it came to geographic targeting, the pop-ups said some of the ads were aimed at people in the United Kingdom while others specified England.But they all said: ""There could also be other factors not listed here,"" and it seems unlikely campaigns with limited funds are blanketing the country rather than going for key seats.The same was true of ads from The Fair Tax Campaign, back after after an initial ban for running an ad without labelling who had paid for it, as I revealed a fortnight ago.The Fair Tax Campaign was started by former Boris Johnson aide Alex Crowley.A former Conservative minister Richard Tracey is behind Parents' Choice.And Daily Express journalist James Bickerton founded the Campaign against Corbynism in the summer after becoming convinced Labour ""had been taken over by people with an at best questionable attachment to core liberal-democratic values"".He told me there had been a lot of interest and about a dozen people now work unpaid to coordinate the campaign.""We are funded entirely by our supporters and received a surge of donations from October onwards,"" he said.The group is not yet listed with the Electoral Commission as a ""non-party campaigner"".""We've been in contact with the Electoral Commission and plan to register in the next week or so,"" Mr Bickerton said.The public has sent in far more of these anti-Corbyn and pro-Brexit ads than messages run by Labour supporters and the Remain side of the debate.But we have have seen a couple of Momentum's pro-Corbyn adverts and received a few examples from the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, which were critical of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.In terms of spending, though, all of these organisations are dwarfed by one organisation: Best for Britain.Between 8 and 14 NovemberThis pro-Remain campaign, registered with the Electoral Commission, has spent £659,475 since the beginning of October 2018 on Facebook - including ads placed on Instagram as well as third-party apps via the Facebook Audience Networks - £34,228 of which was last week.That puts it in fourth place behind the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Conservatives.By comparison, last week's spending by the Campaign Against Corbynism was £4,619.After two weeks of the election campaign, spending on Facebook adverts has already topped £1m.Whether that cash has delivered any results remains to be seen - but Facebook users in marginal seats can expect to be assailed by messages from all sides between now and 12 December.Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social media platform, send a screenshot of it and the Why Am I Seeing This Ad message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk.Update 18 November:The illustration at the top of the article has been corrected as it originally showed the logo for Fair Tax Mark rather than the Fair Tax Campaign."
technology	Tech Tent: Tik Tok and the Uighur Muslims	Account suspendedSuspicion of Chinese companies	"It is a place where a mostly teenage audience goes to mime to music, share memes and generally have a laugh.But on the Tech Tent podcast this week, we find out how TikTok got immersed in a deadly serious row about censorship.It was Sunday evening when 17-year-old Feroza Aziz posted a video on her TikTok account.It appeared at first to be a guide to curling your eyelashes. But after a few seconds, she put down the eyelash curler and urged viewers to search out information about China's mistreatment of Uighur Muslims.Speaking to the BBC, she explained why she felt compelled to act.""As a Muslim, I've always faced oppression and racism. But to see that these group of people, this ethnic group is going through much more than I could ever imagine, I thought that this isn't right and I need to spread awareness about this,"" she said.Her denunciation of what she described as ""another holocaust"" seemed designed to provoke TikTok's Chinese owner Bytedance, testing its claims that outside China it does not censor political content.Indeed, in a follow-up video she explained that she started her video chatting about eyelashes as a way of slipping past the moderators.As the video went viral, both on TikTok and other platforms, the social media world waited for Bytedance to act.But at first nothing happened and the video stayed up.Then, says Feroza, she woke up on Monday morning to find her account was suspended, meaning she could not post any new videos.By Tuesday, facing a growing storm, Bytedance was briefing journalists - including the BBC - that the suspension of the account was nothing to do with Feroza's activism on behalf of the Uighurs.Instead, it was because 10 days earlier she had posted a video featuring Osama Bin Laden, infringing TikTok's rules on terrorism.On the face of it, this sounded serious.But then it emerged that the video in question was a jokey piece about the assumptions people made about the boys Feroza might date, ending with a one-second photo of Bin Laden.Feroza explained that as a Muslim growing up in America she had been ridiculed, called a terrorist and ""Bin Laden's wife"", and she had decided to respond with humour.Her first account had been taken down because of the satirical video, so she had started a new account.""I made multiple posts on it and nothing happened. Right when I posted about the Uighurs in China, my account was suspended.""Despite her suspension, the video continued to attract views and the row seemed to be dying down - until early on Thursday when it disappeared for just under an hour.Bytedance blamed this on human error by a moderator and once again stressed that it did not censor political content.""It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,"" the company said.While China has a number of extremely successful and popular social media services, TikTok is the first to make much of an impact outside Asia.It was after Bytedance paid $1bn (£770m) for the Musical.ly video app in 2017 that its ambitions to become a force in the United States and Europe became clear.But since then, suspicion of Chinese companies - particularly in the United States - has hardened. Now, politicians are asking whether that sale should ever have been allowed to proceed.TikTok is growing rapidly and earning very respectable revenues. In recent months, it has been on a hiring spree, taking on a number of seasoned public relations professionals.Now that activists have spotted what a useful platform the video site can be for messages of dissent against the Chinese government, that PR team can expect to be kept very busy."
technology	England boss Gareth Southgate reveals high-tech tips	Training load	"England football boss Gareth Southgate has revealed how he uses data analysis to manage and train his squad.He told an audience in London that, within 12 hours of a match featuring one of his players, he could access data on their performance - wherever the game was played.Southgate, whose team is currently preparing for Euro 2020, was speaking at a Google Cloud Next event.He said he had even crunched data on ""thousands"" of penalty shootouts.It was only within the past six months, Southgate pointed out, that coaches had been allowed to use iPads in the dugout.""You'll see other sports such as rugby for example, the coaches sit in the stand and they can get live data feedback,"" he said.The England boss said he now keenly gathered information on his players' appearances at matches shortly after they had finished.""Within 12 hours of the game, I know wherever my players are in Europe, I can access how they played, how far they've run,"" he said.And that information helps Southgate decide which players to select for upcoming fixtures.Additionally, by analysing footage of thousands of penalty shootouts, he and his team work out the preferences of outfield players and goalkeepers, to improve England's strategy for such crucial set-pieces.But sharing too much data with players could make them play worse.""When I took over, there were no records of the past older England managers that have been over 30 years,"" Southgate said.""Now, everything we do is stored, everything we do is shared.""We are awash with data, and that's great - but what's the bit that makes a difference?""In football, we're a low scoring game with a lot of random events and so blips in the data you can read too much into.""Ultimately, the player and the players still have to have the nerve to put the ball on the spot and execute.""But there are some consistent things that we know that we need to do to be able to win.""The most important thing for us is to avoid injury.""Therefore the training load is a really key piece of data for us, which helps the other club as well, because if we overload the player physically there is more chance of getting injured""."
technology	Tech Tent: Talking to Mr Raspberry Pi	Small start	"It was a scheme with limited ambitions - getting more young people with coding skills to apply for a university course.But seven years after its launch, Raspberry Pi has become one of the most successful computers in history. On this week's Tech Tent, we talk to the project's founder about where it came from and what is next.This week, Pi creator Eben Upton was honoured with the Lovie Award for lifetime achievement, recognition of the extraordinary impact that the Raspberry Pi has had.It was conceived as a charitable venture at a time when Eben Upton was interviewing applicants for the computer science course at Cambridge University and was disappointed at the number and calibre of the young people he was seeing.When I met him this week at Raspberry Pi's commercial headquarters in Cambridge - which is churning out substantial amounts of revenue for the charitable arm - he told me that as far as the original aim was concerned, it was job done.From a low of 200 applicants to study computing, they were now up to 1,100.""We have twice as many people applying to study computer science at Cambridge as we had at the height of the dotcom boom. And I understand from people that are still involved in the admissions process, that when you ask them how did you get into computers, they do say 'Raspberry Pi.'""But what was unexpected - and drove the project off course for a while - was the huge enthusiasm not from children but from 40-something hobbyists who saw in the Raspberry Pi the rebirth of computers like the BBC Micro which they had cut their teeth on in the 1980s.Mr Upton says, however, that these enthusiasts ended up being the people who took the Raspberry Pi into schools: ""All those people were increasingly volunteers in after-school clubs. So that enthusiasm in the hobbyist community was then feeding back into the informal bit of education.""At the same time manufacturers were finding a place for the tiny computer in all sorts of industrial processes, and sales continued to soar. Nearly 30 million have been sold, making the Raspberry Pi the third most successful computing platform after the PC and the Mac.So where next? Around 70 staff work on the commercial side, compared with 130 on the charity arm whose mission continues to be computing education. One commercial project - publishing a clutch of magazines including one about games development - seems surprisingly analogue, though Upton says it all fits in with the Pi's educational mission.As he shepherds me round the offices on a Cambridge science park, we whizz past a research lab where a secret project that he won't tell me about is under way - but it is clear that this still tiny business has big ambitions.Raspberry Pi is the tech start-up success that happened by accident - so at a time when home-grown firms across the UK and Europe lack confidence, what can they learn from it?""I think if you try and build a business which stays focused on doing one thing, and doing it well, and you plug away at it year after year after year, you can build something that grows.""But he says the key is to think beyond borders: ""It's really important to us to have that kind of global ambition. I think we've got the talent here in the UK to make a go of it.""After my visit to Raspberry Pi, I went on to see two other Cambridge companies. One, CMR Surgical, was a medical robotics firm already valued at over $1bn (£780m) five years after it was founded. The other was a tiny start-up called Intellegens founded by a physics tutor at a Cambridge college, and developing machine learning techniques to discover new materials.In this university city, there are still plenty of people hoping to turn Cambridge ingenuity into world-class businesses."
technology	Election 2019: What big tech isn't telling us about ads		"All over the country, voters, reporters and other observers have been going through something of an awakening about the extent that political parties are using social media to target us.In a post-Cambridge Analytica-scandal world there's suspicion about how we might be being manipulated.To address concerns, the tech giants have created databases to show what political adverts are being run and by whom.There's no doubt that more is being disclosed than in previous campaigns, but critics say there's still much more that ""big tech"" could reveal.Let's start with Facebook.In October last year, it launched its Ad Library in the UK. Since then, more than 131,400 adverts related to politics, elections, and social issues have been added to the database. That's almost £11m worth, according to the firm.The library is free to use and easy to navigate. And recently it began including ads run on the firm's photo-centric app, Instagram.You can look up roughly how many times an ad was seen, its approximate cost, the gender and age of those targeted and who made and paid for the advert.You can also see whether an ad was aimed at people in England, Scotland, Wales and/or Northern Ireland.However, there's still much that is not shared.We know that political parties target voters in very specific areas, such as marginal seats, but the library doesn't reveal where exactly an ad was shown.We also know that people are targeted by personal details - for example, interested in ""the environment"" or ""yoga"" or more political interests, like ""GMB union"". But that information, too, is not shared to the wider public.Facebook has previously said that transparency is important to ""prevent future interference in elections"".So reporters recently pressed it about these shortcomings. The firm said it planned to improve the database but would not be drawn on whether it intended to divulge the missing information about geographic or interest-based targeting.When shown an ad, Facebook users can ask for more specific information about how it came to be shown to them.The BBC and other news organisations have been trying to crowdsource the information from those targeted. But that only gives a fragmented view of what is going on - an unsatisfactory state of affairs, according to the co-founder of the Coalition for Reform of Political Advertising.""Voters having the full picture of how they're targeted is important, as it may impact their evaluation of the information being conveyed to them,"" Benedict Pringle told the BBC.""If a voter knows they are being targeted because of their age, sex or occupation it might encourage them to question the message and think, 'Yes, well you would be saying that to me, wouldn't you?'""Also, if techniques deployed by political actors are unavailable for scrutiny by watchdogs and journalists it can enable malpractice.""But Facebook claims that it is now ""more transparent"" about ads than those behind more traditional outlets, such as billboards, direct mail, leaflets or targeted email campaigns.""This is the first UK general election since we introduced these changes and we're already seeing many journalists using these transparency tools to scrutinise the adverts which are running during this election,"" said Rebecca Stimson, head of Facebook's UK Public Policy.""This is something we welcome and it's exactly why we introduced these changes.""In the 2017 general election, more than £3m was spent by all parties on Facebook.But a further £1m or so went to another often overlooked source - Google.Ads can be purchased to appear at the top of its search results, within its YouTube videos or placed on third-party webpages via its ad tech platforms.So, for example, a user might have been shown brief text-based messages by the Conservative Party promising to make ""our streets safer"" or the Brexit Party promising to ""stand up for democracy"".Google launched its own version of a political ad library in March, and has so far listed more than 1,400, totalling £144,500.But it is far more vague than Facebook about the details.When it lists the amount spent, it does so only in large bands, for example ""from £500-£25,000"".Likewise, the range for the number of people reported to have seen an ad is very broad- for example, ""between 10,000 and 100,000"".Moreover, the site says the details are updated ""generally"" only every week.There is a way to get more information.You can find out how ads are targeted by gender, postcode and age. But to do so, you have to download a large, complex set of spreadsheets.One thing you can't find out is the crucial ""key words"" that parties have bought up to ensure their ads are seen when someone searches for certain topics, even those containing rival parties' names.Google says it is ""thinking hard"" about the feedback it's receiving but has not made any specific commitments.""We believe that our transparency report helps provide valuable information to voters, public bodies and researchers,"" said UK spokesman Elijah Lawal.He added that it had gone further than Facebook and banned searches based on people's ""interests"" in certain sensitive topics, as well as paying regard to the legal protections given against profiling users for having the traits themselves.""We don't enable advertisers to target ads to citizens based on their inferred political leanings; nor do we allow ads to be personalised to people based on sensitive information, such as their religion, sexual orientation, or membership in a trade union.""Snapchat is also running political adverts in this election and it, too, offers detailed targeting to politicians and parties.The company also has an ad library, albeit only in spreadsheet form.Earlier this month, Twitter announced it would ban outright political advertising from 22 November. It seems already to have had an effect in the UK, as we've not yet seen advertising from any of the main political parties on the platform.It follows LinkedIn, which introduced a ban in June 2018. TikTok announced a similar measure last month.For now, all the commitments are voluntary. But some think that it's time the sector faced official scrutiny.""Parliament needs to legislate to appoint or create a political-advertising regulator and update laws relating to political advertising,"" said Mr Pringle.""A political-content regulator could then develop a code based on legislation, which would require oversight by Parliament.""But that won't happen before this election, and it will be up to the next batch of MPs to decide whether to make it a priority."
technology	Tech Tent - Ireland’s data supremo	Also on the podcast this week:	"She's the data tsar most feared by the US tech giants - and on this week's Tech Tent, Helen Dixon tells us she is prepared to exercise her considerable powers.Ireland is a small country so you might think its data protection commissioner could be safely ignored by giant Californian corporations - after all Facebook's annual revenues now amount to almost as much as the Irish government spends each year.But Ireland matters to the tech firms because it's where many base their international operations, partly because of a favourable tax regime. That in turn means that Ireland's data regulator takes the lead in watching over how they comply with Europe's tough new data law - the General Data Protection Regulation.Under the GDPR, firms could face fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover if they play fast and loose with customer data. When I met Helen Dixon at the regulator's modest offices in a Georgian Dublin townhouse, she was keen to stress that just because no such draconian fines had been handed out yet, that did not mean she was asleep on the job.She wanted to make sure any case was watertight before making a decision which could put the credibility of the new regime at stake: ""If we rush to judgement on something we will simply lose once it's appealed to court if we haven't followed the procedures that are necessary.""But it is clear that one major company is the focus of much of the regulator's work. Facebook, whose shiny Dublin offices housing hundreds of employees are just a couple of miles away, is the subject of 11 of the Data Protection Commission's 21 major investigations.A number of the complaints originate from two major European privacy campaigns, one led by the long-term Facebook critic Max Schrems.Helen Dixon says one major scandal has changed the way the public think about their data rights: ""I think Cambridge Analytica was definitely a big wake-up call. And then with the GDPR coming after that, people really began to tune into data protection and their rights and what is happening with their data.""The other regulator feared by the tech giants is, of course, Europe's Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who has been taking on the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook, sparking protests from the Trump administration.Helen Dixon says there is an overlap between the work of the data and the competition regulators. She points at Facebook's takeover of WhatsApp in 2014 and makes it clear she thinks the European Commission should have looked harder at making conditions about the sharing of data between the two businesses before approving the deal.""You cannot on the one hand approve something without any conditions attached and then act surprised when the two companies seek to share data with one another.""She promises that fines will come and new precedents for how tech companies behave with our data will be set as she punishes those who offend against the GDPR. But she cautions that there are no easy answers, nobody has found a middle way between a free service that tracks ""every centimetre of our lives"" and paying a subscription so that we are not tracked.""I don't think anyone will thank us if we simply say, 'Well, let's shut all of that down,' when there's no alternative on the horizon. So we're on the job, I think we know what we're doing.""Stream or download the latest Tech Tent podcast"
technology	Apple to take 'deeper look' at disputed borders	Ukrainian condemnation	"Apple says it is taking ""a deeper look"" at how it handles disputed borders.Ukraine criticised the tech giant for showing Crimea as part of Russia's territory on its Maps and Weather apps.An Apple spokeswoman says the company follows international and domestic laws and the change, which is only for users in Russia, had been made because of new legislation there.Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 was condemned by much of the international community.In a statement, Apple stressed ""we have not made any changes to Apple Maps regarding Crimea outside of Russia.""We review international law as well as relevant US and other domestic laws before making a determination in labelling on our Maps and make changes if required by law.""Apple added it as a result of its review of how disputed borders are handled, it might make more changes in the future.""Our intention is to make sure our customers can enjoy using Maps and other Apple services, everywhere in the world.""The changes to Apple's Crimea map for users in Russia were announced earlier in the week by the State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, in a statement, which described the former boundaries as an ""inaccuracy"".""Crimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory,"" the statement read.Russia treats the naval port city of Sevastopol as a separate region.Apple has been in talks with Russia for several months and had hoped to keep Crimea as an undefined territory, part of neither Russia nor Ukraine.Google, which produces its own popular map app, also shows Crimea as belonging to Russia when viewed from the country.

technology	Tech Tent: Twitter bans political adverts		"This week Twitter's Jack Dorsey made the power of social media firms to swing elections a hot topic again, with a promise to banish all political ads from his platform.On Tech Tent we explore whether Facebook will now be forced to follow suit.Mr Dorsey's intervention in a fusillade of tweets could hardly have been timed better to embarrass his much mightier rival. It came just hours before Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg spoke to analysts on a conference call about another stunning set of financial results.""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" declared Mr Dorsey, going on to explain what he saw as the dangers presented by online political advertising: ""Machine learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes.""But then in a clear swipe at Facebook he unleashed this: ""It's not credible for us to say, 'We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad… well... they can say whatever they want!'""Facebook has, of course, excluded political ads from its efforts to at least label misinformation, a policy which has seen it come under sustained fire from Democrat politicians alleging that this opens the door to a campaign of lies from their opponents.On his conference call about Facebook's latest results Mark Zuckerberg insisted the policy wasn't about making money - political ads accounted for only 0.5% of the social media giant's revenues - but about a reluctance to act as a censor of political speech. ""I can assure you that from a business perspective, the controversy this creates far outweighs the very small percentage of our business that these political ads make up,"" he said.What is clear is that political parties would be far more reluctant to lose Facebook than Twitter as a platform for their paid messages.Alex Balfour, a marketing consultant who advises major sporting organisations on the use of Facebook to promote their messages, tells us just how effective it can be: ""There are potentially over 30,000 interests that you can target on Facebook and Instagram, things such as their interest in dogs or in a football team, whether you've travelled recently, whether you have a friend who has a birthday.""He added: ""So you can get very granular and you can also identify people by age by sex, and by very specific location.""After the controversy surrounding its role in the 2016 US presidential election and in the UK's EU referendum, Facebook has made some moves to make political advertising on its platform more transparent. Adverts have to have clear labelling showing who has paid for them and the Facebook Ad Library allows anyone to inspect every ad that has run on the platform, and the total spending of every organisation.Over the last week, for instance, the leading spender in the UK has been the government which invested £192,753 in adverts between the 22 and 28 October. All that spending was on the Get Ready for Brexit campaign.But Alex Balfour points out that the transparency only goes so far.While Facebook provides a very rough snapshot of the age and location of who has seen an ad, there is no information on how they were targeted: ""I think the bit that's concerning, is that it's easy to micro-target voters using criteria that are not clear with very specific messages, which may not tell the whole story of what a campaign is trying to achieve.""Facebook shows no sign of wanting to follow Twitter's lead in banishing paid political ads. As the UK general election campaign gets underway, the social media platform is bound to be a vital campaigning arena, indeed it is likely to be the principal focus for party spending.That means it will be vital to know just who is being targeted with which ads - so if you receive any in your Facebook feed over the coming weeks, do let us know!

technology	Tech Tent: Shutting down the software scammers	Also on the podcast this week:	"It's a common experience. The phone rings at home, and somebody claiming to be from Microsoft tells you there is something wrong with your computer and they can fix it.But usually this is a scam called computer software service fraud - and on this week's Tech Tent we go behind the scenes of an international operation to shut down the call centres behind it.We are on the ground in Kolkata as the cyber-squad of the city's police force raid what they claim are two criminal call centres, arresting 20 people and seizing computers.We also hear from Doug Varey who lost £4,000 after taking a call from one of the companies raided by the Kolkata Police.He describes how it all began with pop-up ads for anti-virus software. Mr Varey, a retired businessman who says he knows little about computers, thought it sounded a good deal and signed up. He was given a security number and told to demand it if anyone called up - to make sure they weren't scammers.A few months later, he got a phone call from his ""security advisor"" who quoted the number and told him there was a serious problem with his PC.He was then shown what he was told was a Russian hacker, who had taken over his computer and was buying guns in Mr Varey's name. ""This chap said, 'Oh my god, oh my god, this is worse than I thought.' And he was increasing my level of anxiety, to the point where I was panicking.""So frightened was he, that he agreed to allow the caller to access his online bank account and transfer £4,000 to pay for a package of increased security. Only weeks later did he realise that he had been the victim of a fraud.We also speak to a man who has turned the table on the scammers. Jim Browning is an IT professional who, in his spare time, investigates this type of fraud and documents his findings on his very popular YouTube channel.He describes how he has set up a computer which acts as bait for the scammers, convincing them that they have gained access to another victim. In one case, he was then able to spend weeks ""inside"" a Kolkata call centre.""What I was able to do was to deliberately allow them connection to my computer, and I reversed that connection and I could see exactly what the scammers were seeing,"" he said.Then he was able to take a tour via a laptop in the call centre: ""They actually lifted this laptop off their desk and it had a webcam on it. And I was able to see right around the call centre and both see and hear through their microphone exactly what was going on.""Mr Browning has observed the range of techniques used by the scammers to gain remote access to their victims' computers and then drain their bank accounts. Some claim to be from a failed computer firm offering a refund, others say they are from a credit card provider and have noticed some suspicious activity.He has been passing on the information he gathers to the police in Kolkata. But while there have been some successes in the battle against the scammers, this remains a huge and lucrative industry.Mr Varey admits that he was foolish to fall for the scam - but he hopes his story will help others to understand the dangers of allowing cold callers to gain access to their computers.Stream or download the latest Tech Tent podcast"
technology	Blade Runner: How well did the film predict 2019's tech?	1. Robots are much smarter3. Homes are also getting smarter5. The planet is changing6. Blade Runner ignores the Instagram generation8. Most hairdryers still look like hairdryers	"It's November 2019 and Los Angeles is in a state of urban decay. The population has dwindled, and humans face a new threat from manufactured biological robots gone rogue...Back in 1982, this is how Blade Runner director Ridley Scott imagined the world would be.Thirty-seven years after the film was released, how accurate were its predictions about how technology would play a bigger role in our lives?Here are some of the things the film got right, and others where it was way off the mark.Set in November 2019, the original film follows Rick Deckard, whose job as a police ""blade runner"" is to hunt and kill bio-engineered androids known as replicants.So-called Nexus 6 replicants are described as ""virtually identical to a human"" and ""at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them"".When a group arrives on Earth to try to extend their four-year lifespan, Deckard is summoned to eliminate them.Today's mechanical robots do not look as lifelike as Zhora, Pris, Roy and Leon.Even when they take human form - like Hanson Robotics' Sophia - you are more likely to experience pre-scripted jokes and a clunky conversation, rather than the self-aware reflections on mortality and talk of ""tears in the rain"" found in the movie.But AI is getting smarter.Just this week, Google's sister-company DeepMind said it had created the first ""agents"" that had reached the top league of Starcraft 2, one of the most popular esport video games.And ""basic pleasure models"" like Pris have been foreshadowed by a nascent sex-bot industry. The real-world robotic sex dolls may lack an inner-life, but they are becoming more interactive, and there are even sex doll brothels in Europe.2. Video calling is mainstreamDeckard's video call to replicant Rachael is an example of where today's tech has overtaken that shown in the film.Video calling actually started as early as the 1920s, when the boss of telecoms giant AT&T spoke to former US president Herbert Hoover using a TV signal and phone line.But it was not until Skype launched in 2003 that it started to become commonplace.Today, video calls are made in a variety of ways, including Apple's FaceTime, Google's Duo and Facebook's WhatsApp - all of which are capable of delivering a higher-resolution image to smartphones than the bulky booth could display in the film.And unlike Blade Runner, it does not cost $1.25 (95p) to make a short call.Virtual assistants feature prominently in the film.As Deckard returns home, he's asked for his ""voice print identification"" as he steps into the lift.""Deckard 97"" he replies while punching the same numbers into a keypad. ""Thank you"", a female voice responds.In the real world, Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant can identify us by our voice patterns and tailor their behaviour accordingly.Eldon Tyrell, founder of the Tyrell Corporation which makes replicants, also uses a virtual assistant.But his preference for candlelight rather than internet-connected bulbs at home would make it impossible to enjoy the kind of automated lighting routines offered by today's smart home systems.Switching to security, Deckard uses a smart key to open his front door.Norwegian Tor Sørnes invented the first recordable keycard door lock in the 1970s.Today, these cards are used by hotels around the world. But the latest wave of smart locks are more likely to require a wireless signal from your mobile or a biometric reading to control entry.4. Lie detectors are still usedCentral to the film's plot is the Voight-Kampff machine, which is used by blade runners to separate humans from robots, using questions designed to provoke an emotional response.It's an elaborate machine which measures bodily functions, such as contractions of the eye's iris.While it looks very different to the first polygraph machine of 1921, UK police forces still use them, particularly to investigate sex offences.However, their reliability has been disputed. A lie detector test is not admissible in the UK as evidence.US company Converus uses similar iris technology to detect lies.Dim lights and dark skies portray Los Angeles in 2019 as a city that has been damaged by industrial pollution, forcing many to flee.""There's no housing shortage around here,"" genetic designer JF Sebastian tells replicant Pris as she visits his home. ""Plenty of room for everyone.""In reality, Los Angeles gets ever more crowded by the year.But fears about climate change have prompted California to try to lead the way in cutting carbon emissions.Photographs play a central role in the film, both as evidence and as a way for Rachael to convince herself she is human.Deckard analyses several physical Polaroid pictures for clues on how to find other replicants.In reality, Polaroid cameras still exist, but they are now more of a novelty than the smartphones we regularly use to take snaps.It is more likely we would see today's Deckard trawling through the replicants' Instagram or Facebook accounts for clues.And Rachael's sole photograph with her mother might be replaced by several selfies.Today computational photography is becoming the norm, helping our phones take incredible low-light pictures, and automatically blur the background of our portrait shots.But the Esper machine, which Deckard uses to find clues by zooming in on different things within photos, remains ahead of its time.It enables him to see objects and people from different angles, and items which were not previously visible.AI researchers are working on software that can create interactive 3D views from a single 2D source image, but it's likely to be many more years to come before Photoshop gets the feature.Atari is another big brand in the film. The video game pioneer was huge in arcades and homes in the 1970s and 1980s.And while it has since ceded ground to PlayStations, Xboxes and Switches, there are plans to breathe fresh life into the brand.A new Atari VCS throwback console attracted more than $2m (£1.54m) in pre-orders last year - but doubts have been raised as to whether it will ship by early 2020 as planned.7. Flying cars aren't mainstream... yetMany films have depicted flying cars in the future. And while lots of progress has been made on the concept of flying cars , both in Japan and the United States, there are none on the roads (or in the sky) yet.The inside of Blade Runner's flying cars are full of gadgets, and look similar to the cockpit of a plane.But it's notable that those inside are not strapped in - the film was made before California introduced mandatory seat belt laws.In one scene, replicant Zhora dries her hair in what looks like an upside-down goldfish bowl: it dries in seconds.While ionic technology and ceramic heating elements help today's hairdryers to do a faster job, even a £300 Dyson model takes minutes rather than seconds to finish.BBC Radio 3 explores Blade Runner's legacy and impact in a new series. Listen online from Monday 4 November."
technology	Tech Tent: Do we need gadget etiquette lessons	Plato's issue	"Should you inform visitors to your home that smart speakers could pick up what they say? And when it comes to staring at Twitter on your phone, how much is too much?Gadget etiquette is something we are all grappling with, and on this week's Tech Tent we hear from two people who have played a big role in shaping the way we interact with technology.For Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, it has been a big week. Not content with being a huge force in internet search and online advertising, Google has long wanted to be big in hardware.It's had variable success with everything from the Google Home smart speakers, to virtual reality headsets and the ill-fated Google Glass. But it's the Pixel smartphone which is probably the flagship product.So far, it's won great reviews but quite modest sales, so a lot was riding on this week's launch of the Pixel 4.When our technology desk editor Leo Kelion interviewed Rick Osterloh he was eager to talk about what he called ""ambient computing"", the idea that our gadgets are all around us but sort of merge into the background except when we need them.The new radar feature on the Pixel 4 was an example of this, he explained, allowing you to interact with the phone without touching it.""If you're listening to music, you can easily swipe between songs without touching your device. If your alarm goes off in the morning, as you approach it, the alarm sound reduces and then you can swipe to dismiss the alarm. Your phone almost senses a little bit what you want from it.""With a new Google Nest smart speaker also being launched, we are looking at a future where Google is listening to us and sensing us in all sorts of ways.Then Leo came up with a question which seemed to stump Mr Osterloh - should a visitor to your home be told that you've got one of these ambient devices before they walk in?""It's a great question,"" he said. ""Gosh I haven't thought of that."" But after a moment's thought he decided, yes, that would be good gadget etiquette.""Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I mean, I would do when someone enters into my home, and I think it's probably something that the products themselves should try to start to indicate."" He said Nest cameras already signalled their presence.But for many of us the problem is not that gadgets are hidden away - but they are in our face all the time because we are addicted to them.Nir Eyal's career has been all about helping firms get us hooked on gadgets and the services they provide. Indeed, he wrote a book called Hooked, describing the techniques that made products ""sticky"".But now he is advising us on how to avoid being constantly distracted by technology. His book Indistractable is full of tips about having a more sensible relationship with your gadgets.He rejects the idea that many of us are addicted to our screens: ""The vast majority of us aren't addicted, we are distracted, meaning we can do something about it if we try.""He also says that parents may be too focused on screen time as the latest danger to their children's wellbeing: ""Whether it was rock and roll in previous generations or rap music or comic books, we want something to blame.""But he says there are plenty of ways we can avoid being distracted, whether it is having rules about phones at the dinner-table or keeping your social media apps off the home screen of your device.His key piece of advice, however, is that you should look within yourself to find the reason you cannot ignore those pings and pop-ups from your smartphone:""We turn to these devices as distractions to avoid feeling something we don't want to experience -. boredom, loneliness, stress, fatigue, uncertainty.""The last decade has seen huge changes, as smartphones and social media have become integral to our lives. But Nir Eyal points out that Plato was talking about distraction 2,500 years ago. The technology changes radically, but humans face much the same challenges."
technology	Tech Tent: should TikTok scare Facebook?	China syndrome	"It is the Chinese-owned short video-sharing site which you may not have heard of if you are over 30.But on Tech Tent this week we explore why TikTok could be the biggest threat to Facebook.We learned two important things about TikTok this week - it's earning a surprising amount of money, and Mark Zuckerberg sees it as a serious rival.Figures obtained by the Reuters news agency showed that its owner ByteDance earned revenues of between $7bn (£5.7bn) and $8.4bn in the first half of the year. And while it made losses over the period as a whole, it moved into profit in June and is confident of continuing profitability in the second half of the year.At a time when the likes of WeWork, Uber and Lyft are warning that the path to profits is long and uncertain, that is an impressive performance from a tech business just a couple of years old.And Mark Zuckerberg seems to agree. A leaked recording of a Facebook staff meeting obtained by tech news site The Verge shows him telling his team just how rapidly TikTok is growing.""It's the first consumer internet product built by one of the Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the world. It's starting to do well in the US, especially with young folks. It's growing really quickly in India. I think it's past Instagram now in India in terms of scale. So yeah, it's a very interesting phenomenon.""He then goes on to outline plans to take on this ""interesting phenomenon"" by launching a copycat version in Mexico, where TikTok has yet to make much of an impact.So how big is TikTok among teenagers?I got some insight into its growth when I gave a talk in a South Wales school a few weeks ago. As is my habit, I started with an instant poll of the audience's social media habits. Although Facebook was on the wane, a forest of hands went up for Instagram and Snapchat. But while at a similar talk some months earlier TikTok hadn't got a mention, this time there were plenty of nods and smiles from the audience.And the research firm AppAnnie, which monitors downloads of mobile applications, reinforces that anecdotal evidence. Its European analyst Paul Barnes tells us that outside China, Android users spent 1.1 billion hours on TikTok in August, a 400% increase on a year ago.But he says that what should really worry other social media firms is the level of commitment of TikTok users, compared to someone posting a picture on Instagram or updating their Facebook status.""You have to put quite a lot of time in to make a good TikTok video,"" he explains. ""So if I was a rival and looking at it, I'd be quite jealous of the amount of time and the amount of commitment that users of TikTok are putting into publishing their own content on there.""But with this rapid growth come concerns about how safe the platform is. Earlier this year a BBC investigation found TikTok failing to close the accounts of some adult users who had contacted children with sexual messages. TikTok says ""promoting a safe and positive app environment for our users is our top priority"".It is also clear that it is very much a Chinese company, with all that entails in terms of censorship. The Guardian recently published a leak of internal documents showing that moderators are instructed to delete videos mentioning sensitive subjects such as Tiananmen Square. There are also suspicions that discussion of the unrest in Hong Kong has been censored.But it is doubtful that its millions of users in Europe and the United States either know or care that TikTok is a Chinese company. When we stopped young people outside a London fashion store to get their views on it they described it as ""fun"", ""catchy"", ""funny"", and ""cringey but a massive trend - it's everywhere"".Perhaps not the kind of words teenagers would use these days to describe either Facebook or Instagram - and that is why Mark Zuckerberg is right to be worried."
technology	Google's smart-city plans 'tech for tech's sake'		"Google's Sidewalk Labs's plans to build a smart city ""from the internet up"" in a disused waterfront area of Toronto contain too much ""tech for tech's sake"", an independent panel has said.It also accused the company of being too vague about what it planned to do.Some of the planned innovations were ""irrelevant or unnecessary"", it added, and did not seem to put citizens first.Sidewalk Labs has said it has consulted thousands of Torontonians and they are at the core of its development plans.But the panel of 15 people, including academics, urban technology and legal experts, ""felt that the plan did not appear to put the citizen at the centre of the design process for digital innovations, as was promised in the beginning and is necessary for legitimacy"".""Some of the solutions felt like 'tech for tech's sake' - applying a complex technological solution to a situation that mostly doesn't need it,"" it said.And there were often much simpler solutions to problems such as how to use public space.""Not sure where to put a path in a new park? Plant grass and give it two months, go back, see where people tramped the grass down - called desire lines - and off you go, build your path there. Can we get better? Sure, of course. But let's tread carefully about what kinds of tech we use.""The panel - set up last year by Waterfront Toronto, the public body overseeing the Quayside project - also questioned:In response, Sidewalk Labs said: ""Most of the feedback we see in this interim report has been conveyed to us throughout our engagement with the digital strategy advisory panel over the last few months.""It is one of the reasons why we are producing the Digital Innovation Appendix which will include a comprehensive list of technology that would be deployed in Quayside, how we would support Toronto's technology ecosystem, and our research work on data governance.""Next month, city officials must decide whether to approve or reject the proposals put forward by Sidewalk Labs."
technology	Ukrainians condemn Apple's Crimea map change	Apple 'boycott'	"Ukrainian politicians and bloggers have added their voice to condemnation of Apple's decision to show Crimea as a Russian territory on its maps.Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko tweeted: ""Apple, please stick to hi-tech and entertainment. Global politics is not your strong side.""Russian ex-world chess champion Garry Kasparov added his voice, calling the decision ""unacceptable appeasement"".Apple is yet to comment on the move.The changes were announced by the State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, in a statement, which described the former listing as an ""inaccuracy"".""Crimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory,"" the statement read.Russia treats the naval port city of Sevastopol as a separate region.The changes, which apply only in Russia, affect both Apple's Map and Weather apps.Apple has been in talks with Russia for several months and had hoped to keep Crimea as an undefined territory, part of neither Russia nor Ukraine.Google, which also produces a popular Maps app, also shows Crimea as belonging to Russia when viewed from the country. The changes happened in March.When Google Maps is viewed from Ukraine, the maps show no clear border between Crimea and Ukraine but also no border between Crimea and Russia, according to BBC Monitoring.Garry Kasparov's tweet read: ""Apple changing its maps inside Russia to make Crimea part of Russia is a huge scandal. Regionalisation of facts is unacceptable appeasement.""He added: ""Software is soft power. American tech companies should stand up for the values of innovation that made their success possible, not bow down to dictators for a little extra cash they don't even need.""Meanwhile Mr Prystaiko said: ""Let me explain in your terms, @Apple. Imagine you're crying out that your design and ideas, years of work and piece of your heart are stolen by your worst enemy but then smb [somebody] ignorant doesn't give a damn about your pain. That's how it feels when you call #Crimea a Russian land.""Ukraine's US embassy was equally critical on Twitter.""We guess Ukrainians not giving any thanks to @Apple this #Thanksgiving. So let's all remind Apple that #CrimeaIsUkraine and it is under Russian occupation - not its sovereignty,"" it tweeted.Former Ukrainian foreign minister Volodymyr Ohryzko suggested that a boycott of Apple products might be one way to deal with issue.""Trust me, they will hear [us] quickly. And will change everything quickly. Are there volunteers?"" he asked on Twitter.But popular blogger Anton Hodza, while outraged, took a more light-hearted approach.""Apple's actions are a disgrace. We need to show them that we are outraged. Send me your iPhones, MacBooks and iPads. I will burn them, honestly."""
technology	Tech Tent: China and US spar over games, apps and AI		"How much are Western companies are prepared to abandon their principles in order to appease the Chinese government?In the week Apple dropped a controversial app and a games firm suspended an e-sports player for making controversial remarks about Hong Kong, Tech Tent looks at the ethical dilemmas for anyone doing business in China.The app that caused Apple such a headache was called HKmap.Live, which offered real-time updates of where Hong Kong police units were stationed. Apple steered an unsteady course, first refusing to allow it on the App Store, then giving the go-ahead, and finally removing it.Jane Li, from the Hong Kong bureau of the Quartz News site, tells Tech Tent that an editorial in the state newspaper the People's Daily describing the app as ""poisonous"" was probably decisive.She suspects that the commercial implications of defying the Chinese authorities were on the iPhone-maker's mind: ""Probably they would see their products or marketing activities suspended in China.""Ms Li's employer has also been caught up in the free speech row. The Quartz app was removed from China's version of Apple's App Store, again it seems following anger from the Chinese.Apple gave us a statement explaining that the map app violated both its own rules and local laws. It said it had verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app had been used to target and ambush police, and by criminals to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.The company also said the Quartz app was taken down because it didn't comply with Chinese law.Apple's explanations for its actions have not convinced many of its critics.But a games company's move to censor an e-sports player has met with a much angrier response from its customers.Activision Blizzard banned an e-sports player known as Blitzchung from its Hearthstone card game and took away his winnings after he shouted his support for the Hong Kong protests in a post-match interview on its streaming service.Gamers have threatened to boycott Activision's other hit titles, the share price has fallen, and some employees have walked out in protest. The company is desperate to launch the mobile version of Call of Duty in the lucrative Chinese market. But with games forums outside China alive with derogatory comments about the business, it may find that its decision to ban Blitzchung does not even pay off in commercial terms.Activision Blizzard has made no comment except to point to the Hearthstone rulebook which warns players ""engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal"".While American firms are facing ethical dilemmas in China, it has also been a tricky week for Chinese firms trying to do business in the United States, with a clutch of AI companies added to the Trump administration's banned list.Hong Kong-based analyst Jay Huang, of Bernstein Research, tells Tech Tent he sees a widening gulf between the American and Chinese technology industries. He says a lot of American tech firms are thinking of building manufacturing sites outside China - ""they worry the tariffs (imposed by the US on Chinese-produced goods) may become permanent.""As for the Chinese firms, the ban on doing business with American companies such as chipmakers may force them to develop their own components: ""The signal from the US government is clear - if you don't build up your supply chain you have a bottleneck.""Just a few years ago, Silicon Valley and Chinese tech firms seemed eager to collaborate. Now, the US and China are engaged in a trade war and two separate technology spheres with very different cultures are emerging."
technology	Tech Tent: Can AI revolutionise health?	AI drugs?Also on the podcast this week:	"If there's one area where there's real excitement about the improvements in our lives which advances in artificial intelligence could bring, it is healthcare.On Tech Tent this week we ask whether, amidst all the hope and hype, real innovations are beginning to transform the way patients are treated.At Oxford University's Said Business School, some of the leading thinkers in AI research - from the university and beyond - gathered this week.There were fascinating discussions about everything from autonomous cars to the way AI is transforming the finance industry. But the panels on healthcare drew big crowds and a sense that researchers were on the cusp of delivering concrete results which will soon begin to be seen in hospitals.We speak to three Oxford-based scientists working across academia and the commercial world to use AI in medicine.Michalis Papadakis is chief executive of Brainomix, whose technology is already entering hospitals to help doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of strokes after years in the laboratory.He says there is huge potential to improve outcomes for stroke patients: ""Currently every 30 minutes, a stroke patient who could have been saved, dies or remains permanently disabled, not because of the stroke, but because they're admitted in a hospital that doesn't have the expertise to diagnose and select the patient for a life-saving treatment path.""His product, developed with data from thousands of brain scans, helps doctors interpret images and make the fast decisions that are needed when it is suspected that a patient has suffered a stroke.""We have shown that the sensitivity of physicians when they use the tool increases significantly their ability to diagnose and detect stroke damage on the scans compared to how they're doing it now manually.""He admits that the biggest challenge is getting doctors to adopt this new way of working.For Antoniya Georgieva - whose research involves monitoring babies in the womb - that is still some way off.She is ten years into a project which again has depended on gathering a vast store of data, in this case from foetal monitoring units in labour wards in Oxford dating back to 1993. The aim is to automate the process where doctors and midwives can be alerted to the rare cases when a baby is suffering breathing problems and could end up suffering brain damage.""We are taking the burden from having to look at complex graphs, complex information that takes time, that humans are just not so good at.""Instead, her system monitors all those graphs and tells the human experts exactly when they need to be worried.A computer scientist who has based herself in a hospital for ten years and learned as much as she can about medicine, Dr Georgieva is not going to rush to turn her research into a commercial venture. She stresses just how complex the interaction between her algorithms and the mass of physiological data is - and how long it takes to be clear that the AI system is producing better outcomes.Even earlier on the path from AI ideas to real world products is the work of Charlotte Deane, Professor of Structural Bioinformatics at Oxford University. She and her doctoral students are looking at the problem of using AI in drug discovery, the lengthy and expensive process of creating new medicines.With a new drug taking as long as 30 years and costing as much as $2bn (£1.6bn) to develop, she says even if AI could cut that by 10% that would make a huge difference.Prof Deane says the hype around AI is not helpful but progress is being made: ""The challenges are really huge, because biological data is noisy and difficult to deal with. But the algorithms we now have are starting to give us the opportunity to make a real difference.""She does however face one problem in her own research - her doctoral students keep getting hired by the biotech companies clustered around Oxford. Still, the close links between the university and commercial researchers are making this city a small but determined powerhouse in the global battle to revolutionise healthcare through AI."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook has designs on your brain	Also on the podcast this week:	"It is a tiny US tech start-up which is developing a wristband that decodes signals from your brain. But now CTRL-Labs has joined the Facebook empire - and on this week's Tech Tent we explore what this tells us about a future where our brains are linked to computers.Unveiling its purchase of CTRL-Labs, Facebook's virtual reality chief Andrew Bosworth said: ""We know there are more natural, intuitive ways to interact with devices and technology. And we want to build them.""He said the company's wristband could capture your intention, so that you could share a photo with a friend ""just by, well, intending to"".That is quite hard to comprehend but, if he is right, you can see how it might offer a powerful new way for Facebook users to interact with the social media platform - and vice versa.Research into what are called neural interfaces, devices that interact with the human nervous system, is a hot topic right now. We've seen Elon Musk's Neuralink talking of one day helping people who are paralysed to control computers via devices implanted in their brains.Tech Tent talks to one of the leading scientists in this field, Dr Mahnaz Arvaneh, director of the Physiological Signals and Systems Laboratory at Sheffield University. She describes what is called a non-invasive technique, where electrodes are placed on the skull, not inside the brain, to record electrical activity:""We use these brain activities, helping people to control different devices with their minds. This device can be an assistive device, or it can be a game that can help them to improve their cognitive performance.""But how far has this technology advanced? Dr Arvaneh tells us that what seemed like sci-fi a few years ago is now coming true. In the field of healthcare we already have cochlear implants, and deep brain stimulation is now being used in the treatment of conditions such as Parkinson's disease.She says more devices will emerge from the labs soon, though some may be 50 years away: ""But neural interfaces are going to be a type of emerging technology that can significantly change our life, the way that we interact with our environment.""As with any new technology, there are concerns about how it will be used and regulated.Some of these ideas may be sci-fi fantasies, too remote to worry about now. But one question is much more urgent - do we want a social media giant like Facebook to play a big role in this technology?In 2012, Facebook bought a tiny company called Instagram, in 2014 it followed up with WhatsApp - and now some regulators are beginning to ask whether those deals which gave the social media giant access to a huge audience and vast amounts of data should have been examined more closely at the time.Right now, CTRL-Labs is a tiny business - but arguably its technology is more significant than that of either WhatsApp or Instagram.Tech Tent's special guest data specialist Caroline Carruthers says we need to be cautious: ""A big corporation like Facebook won't do something unless it's profitable to them so it would be interesting to understand what they think they're going to get out of it. I think it's important that this technology is shared so we understand what's happening with it and why.""Earlier this month, the Royal Society produced a report on neural interfaces and the ethical challenges they could present. Artificial Intelligence is already provoking plenty of debate about the ethics of smart machines - as the boundary between humans and machines gets more blurred, the neural interface researchers can expect plenty of questions about what is going on in their labs."
technology	Tech entrepreneurs call for more government regulation	Higher ethical standards	"The tech community, once known for being insular and resistant to outside interference, is facing an existential crisis as its members have begun to break ranks and call for fundamental changes at global companies like Google and Facebook.Roger McNamee has been a Silicon Valley insider since Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was in nappies.The venture capitalist has built a name for himself as a big-thinking investor and a kind of sounding board for some of the valley's biggest names in the '80s and '90s, including Bill Gates.McNamee remembers this period in Silicon Valley fondly, recalling how people like Steve Jobs promoted a kind of ""hippie-libertarianism"" that believed in tech's ability to make the world a better place.But starting around the turn of the millennium, these Utopian goals began to be usurped by greed, he says. So he was slightly taken aback when he met Mr Zuckerberg in 2006, and the then-22-year-old impressed him with his sincere belief that Facebook could help connect people all over the world.""I wanted to believe they were different - and they really were different at the beginning,"" he told the BBC's Jane Wakefield.Now, not so much - according to Mr McNamee.Mr McNamee, who served as a mentor to Mr Zuckerberg for three years and was an early investor in the company, made headlines last year when he wrote a number of opinion pieces criticising Facebook for its role in the spread of misinformation in the lead-up to Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election.""All the internet platforms are deflecting criticism and leaving their users in peril,"" he wrote in the Guardian in January 2018, just months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.Since then, he says, little has changed.""I don't believe there's anyone around [Mr Zuckerberg] who tells him what he needs to hear at this moment in time,"" he says.It's not just Facebook, he says. Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have all neglected their civic duties in pursuit of bigger profits. From Cambridge Analytica's alleged election interference to YouTube's role in spreading footage of the Christchurch mosque attack, a number of industry insiders have expressed concern about how today's tech is impacting democracy.At the heart of the problem is search and social companies' reliance on advertising, which rewards content creators who shock and awe, says Mr McNamee.""We need to understand that the business model that is shared by all these internet platforms encourages the worst elements of society,"" he says.Former co-CEO of BlackBerry, Jim Balsillie, says he is ""surprised"" by the lack of ethics he sees at companies today.""We were aggressive, but we weren't immoral or amoral,"" he says.""How can you be a tool for genocide? How can you live with yourself?""It is not just the old guard that is demanding changes inside tech. Young employees at companies like Google and Amazon are staging protests and even quitting over issues like the treatment of women in the workplace and engineering ethics.When Jack Paulson quit his job as a senior engineer at Google in September 2018, due to the company's decision to enter the Chinese market, his resignation went viral.""I view our intent to capitulate to censorship and surveillance demands in exchange for access to the Chinese market as a forfeiture of our values and governmental negotiating position across the globe,"" his letter said.A year later, he told the BBC he feels a part of a worldwide movement of tech workers demanding higher ethical standards across the industry.""Making sure that people know there's others with similar backbone is critical if you want to help,"" he says.Paulson learned of Google's plans in China after tech news outlet the Intercept published a report leaking details of Google's Chinese search engine plans, Project Dragonfly, in August 2018.This summer, Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of public policy, said Project Maven has been terminated. Google also agreed not to renew its contract with the Pentagon for Dragonfly.But Paulson says the company's handling of internal dissent, and the way it addressed employees' ethical concerns, leave much to be desired.When he asked management about their project with China, and the effect it could have on human rights activists, he says they told him ""human rights organisations don't know anything. They don't work at the company, so we don't listen them"".This kind of insider vs outsider mentality makes the tech industry resistant to criticism and change, he says.This lack of ethics is proof companies need to be regulated by the government, says Mr Balsillie, who was co-CEO at Blackberry from 1992-2012. Although it seems odd for a tech entrepreneur to call for more regulation, he says we need to have firm rules around things like data collection - and hefty fines for companies that break them.""I'm not against tech. I'm for tech, and I'm for entrepreneurship and I'm for capitalism, all the way,"" explains Mr Balsillie.""But ultimately the job of government is to regulate for the public good.""But instead of regulation, he says governments have allowed companies to draft their own codes of conduct, courted them to build headquarters in their cities, and allowed them to use their citizens' data.He has been vocal in his opposition to Google parent-company Alphabet's plans to build a ""smart city"" on Toronto's waterfront, telling Toronto's city council the project was a ""colonising experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues"".You can hear more from Roger McNamee on The BBC World Service's Business Daily"
technology	Huawei: Microsoft president seeks end to US tech ban	'Right balance'	"Microsoft's president has called on the US to end a ban on it supplying Huawei with Windows software for the Chinese company's computers.Huawei was blacklisted by the Trump administration in May over claims it posed a threat to the US's security.That prevents American companies from providing it with their latest tech.Brad Smith said he did not believe the US's security would be ""undermined"" by letting Huawei's customers use its operating system or Office apps.""Governments around the world are going to address their national security needs,"" he told BBC News.""But we believe it would be a mistake at the same time to try to draw some new digital iron curtain down the Pacific Ocean - I think that would hold back the United States, would hold back the democracies of the world.""We're one of a number of companies that has applied with the US Commerce department so that we can continue to provide our software operating system to Huawei for devices like laptops.""There may be some issues that require some approaches around 5G but one should ask whether that is the right approach for all of the equipment that a particular company might make.""US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in July his department would issue licences to exempt companies from the ban on selling technology to Huawei, as long as there was no ""threat to US national security"".This would not have affected a separate order from US President Donald Trump that effectively banned Huawei from selling 5G equipment to US telecom networks.However, the Commerce Department does not appear to have issued any such licences despite receiving more than 100 requests.As a result, Huawei will launch its latest Android flagship handset on Wednesday without some of Google's key apps, including YouTube, Maps and its Play Store.BBC News has learned it will instead pre-install the Huawei Mobile Service suite of software on the Mate 30 handset, providing in-house alternatives to Google's products.In addition, Huawei intends to offer a service in phone shops to teach users how to load Google's software on to the Mate 30 themselves.For its part, the Shenzhen-based company denies it poses a cyber-security risk because the Chinese government could make it compromise its customers.""Huawei's devices and networks are not a threat to the United States, or any country,"" its website states.""We fully abide by all local laws and regulations in every nation we operate in.""Mr Smith is Microsoft's longest-serving executive and doubles as its chief legal officer.His comments were made during a wider interview given to the BBC to promote a book about Microsoft's views on regulation and other topical issues.Mr Smith acknowledged the Commerce Department needed ""time to consider"" which companies to grant licences to.But he added: ""We don't think that the security of any country is undermined by people being able to use our search service or use our productivity applications, to use Outlook or Word.""We think that actually spreads opportunities for people.""Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has described his company as being in ""a life or death crisis"" and there has been speculation the Chinese government could retaliate by putting restrictions on US technology companies in turn.Mr Smith signalled Apple and others were more exposed to such a threat but added he was also concerned about how research partnerships could be affected.""We don't have as big a business in China as some other tech companies - only 1.8% of Microsoft's revenue is generated in China,"" he said.""At the same time, we are worried about the impact.""We would worry if we can no longer bring together researchers at Cambridge University or the west coast of the United States or Beijing or Bangalore.""That's where we're going to continue to find the solutions that the world needs. So yes, we are worried if we can't step back and have countries strike the right balance."""
technology	Heads up - why tech is in a race for your face		"If there’s one thing technology companies learned during the smartphone boom, it’s that getting people locked in early is the difference between success and failure.Customers are simply unwilling, at least in any significant number, to leave whatever ecosystem they’ve invested in - whether it’s Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android.And so when there’s a chance to break ground on a new ecosystem, a fresh opportunity to get people locked in for years to come, you can expect a scramble.For “voice”, widely considered the next big platform in tech, the scramble is on, and it's being seen most aggressively in one distinct area: your face.It’s an area with limited real estate - you are likely to have just two ears, and two eyes - and a fraught history of botched attempts at game-changing tech.""To date, the most commonly accepted place to wear technology has been the wrist and Apple’s success with its Watch reflects this,” said Ben Wood, from CCS Insight.“But as Amazon and a number of other players start to get more serious about ear buds and smart glasses, there is growing evidence that the ‘battle for the face’ has begun.”Listen upLet’s begin with the ears.Apple has established an early lead here, built on past glory: the iPhone. Its AirPods, released in 2016, currently dominate the category with a 53% share of the 27 million “hearables"" sold globally from April-June this year, according to data gathered by Counterpoint Research.""Apple will keep leading the market for the time being thanks to its loyal base of hardware users and its sticky ecosystem of devices and software,” said Counterpoint Research senior analyst Liz Lee.""It will also release new ear buds with a major overhaul to the design expected in late 2020 and refresh the market again. We expect that Apple’s share will be around 40%-50% this year and a bit lower next year, but still, it will be the biggest player.""While AirPods appear to be simply a wireless version of the headphones Apple has sold for a decade now, the firm considers them to be something far more strategic: its best opportunity to get consumers interacting with devices using voice.They do little to address Apple’s main problem right now, which is that once people get home, they’re more likely - if they have a smart speaker - to talk to an assistant from Amazon or Google than they are to Siri.Amazon’s problem is the other way round. The success of its Alexa assistant has it leading the smart-speaker market in our homes, according to Canalys research, but the firm’s disastrous attempt to break into smartphones means Alexa has mostly been stuck indoors.On Wednesday, Amazon took significant steps it hopes will change that with the announcement of Echo Buds, wireless ear buds with Alexa built in - the most straightforward way yet to take Alexa out of the home. The device is cheaper than AirPods - $129 v $199 - and has the added selling point of including noise cancellation, something AirPods lack.""It is apparent that access to Alexa could be more appealing for some people than access to Siri, as Alexa can be used to order goods from Amazon directly and Amazon's ecosystem is more open than Apple’s,” said Ms Lee.""Amazon could also take aggressive markdowns including offering its new gadget in Prime deals and bundles for cheap during the Black Friday sales to increase market share.”More in-ear players will soon emerge. Next week, Microsoft is expected to announce its own smart wireless ear buds too. And Google, with its own assistant and a range of voice-powered software (such as auto language translation), could offer another strong device, improving on the Pixel Buds that were launched in 2017. The company is holding its hardware launch event on 11 October.The eyes have itAmazon is also hoping to turn heads - though not too quickly - with Echo Frames. These are glasses with Alexa relatively discreetly built into the titanium frames. Paired to a smartphone, they vibrate when a notification is received and, like the Echo Pods, allow for voice commands to be given to Alexa via two microphones.It’s being seen as a modest first step en route to the real goal: smart glasses containing augmented reality (AR), digitally created imagery laid over the real world.Just as Amazon was talking about Echo Frames at its HQ in Seattle, Facebook was busy sharing its own aspirations for AR at its Oculus Connect developers’ conference in San Jose.Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s head of virtual reality and AR, said the firm was building AR glasses. A demonstration video showed how pop-ups could appear in your vision, alerting you to movie times or directions. This product isn’t imminent - Facebook has a lot of work to do to make the tech a reality.And the firm is currently lacking a full-featured voice assistant of its own (though it has been working on one as part of its Portal video chat range).There are credible rumours that Apple is preparing to release its own AR wearable device too. According to Wired, those who keep a close eye on the code contained in Apple’s operating system, iOS, noticed that deep inside recent updates was code that looked almost certain to be related to some kind of future AR device.Taiwanese analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted an Apple AR device could be ready as early as the middle of next year.Looking foolishGetting these devices to work well is just one hurdle to overcome, however. There are also the issues of style and trust.You’ll remember Google Glass, released in 2013, that as well as suffering from technological shortcomings was also held back by the fact it made the wearer look rather foolish (no offence, Rory).Newer technologies are bulky and cumbersome. Microsoft’s Hololens and Magic Leap’s goggles sit heavy on either the head or hip.And these technologies make other people uncomfortable. Famously, one woman was attacked for wearing Google Glass in a San Francisco bar.AR glasses will need to use outward-facing cameras to detect objects around them, and it is likely that tech firms will consider video recording, and calling, to be a selling point. Ear buds, similarly, will need to capture some amount of audio from the world around them in order to work.The wearer might be fine with that, yes, but what of those around them who may not want to be captured and analysed by companies that have already lost our confidence?That’s what makes this latest tech race different. Anyone buying these devices will spend time considering not just which company has the best technology, but also the best intentions._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Gatwick Airport commits to facial recognition tech at boarding	Consent concerns	"Gatwick has become the UK's first airport to confirm it will use facial-recognition cameras on a permanent basis for ID checks before passengers board planes.It follows a self-boarding trial carried out in partnership with EasyJet last year.The London airport said the technology should reduce queuing times but travellers would still need to carry passports.Privacy campaigners are concerned.On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Gatwick told BBC News it had taken the decision, first reported by the Telegraph newspaper, after reviewing feedback from passengers in the earlier test.""More than 90% of those interviewed said they found the technology extremely easy to use and the trial demonstrated faster boarding of the aircraft for the airline and a significant reduction in queue time for passengers,"" she said.""Gatwick [is now planning] a second trial in the next six months and then rolling out auto-boarding technology on eight departure gates in the North Terminal when it opens a new extension to its Pier 6 departure facility in 2022.""She added passengers would still need to pass through the bag-check security zone, at which point they would need to present a boarding pass.In addition, they would need to scan their passport at the departure gate for the system to be able to match the photo inside to their actual face.The process is similar to that already used at the ePassport arrival gates at some UK airports. But it differs from Gatwick's original test, where travellers scanned their faces at the luggage drop-off zone.That decision will limit Gatwick's ability to use facial recognition for other services.China's Chengdu Shuangliu airport, for example, recently installed a system that automatically presents travellers with up-to-date information about their flights when they walk up to a screen. This is made possible because visitors have to present their passports at an earlier stage.Even so, one civil liberties group is worried travellers might not realise they can opt out.""Our main concern... would be the issue of proper consent,"" said Ioannis Kouvakas, from Privacy International.""Placing general or vague signs that merely let individuals know that this technology is being deployed, once individuals are already inside the check-in area, is inadequate, in our view, to satisfy the strict transparency and consent requirements imposed by data-protection laws.""If this would apply to child travellers... it raises even more concerns, considering the special protection afforded to children's privacy and the risks associated with having their biometrics taken by the airport private entities.""A spokeswoman for Gatwick said it had designed its use of the technology to be ""compliant with all data protection law"" and passengers would be able to choose to have their passports checked by human staff.""Our next passenger trial will take place in the next six months and no data will be stored - instead it will be held momentarily while the identity check takes place, only a matter of seconds,"" she said.Children under a certain age would need parental or guardian consent, she added, although Gatwick had still to determine what the cut-off point would be."
technology	Snapchat says it will fact-check political ads	Ads on Snapchat	"Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel has said the company will fact-check political ads on its platform.The announcement comes as other tech giants face criticism for their policies ahead of the 2020 US presidential elections.Facebook has said that it will not fact-check political ads, while Twitter has banned them altogether.Mr Spiegel said Snapchat tried to ""create a place"" for ads in order to engage young people in politics.All campaign ads will be checked by a dedicated team at Snapchat, he told the news broadcaster CNBC on Monday.In September, Facebook made it clear it would not be fact-checking political adverts ahead of the election. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the platform would treat all posts by politicians as ""newsworthy content"" that should ""be seen and heard"".The company has since come under fire from politicians in Washington, and partially reversed its stance by taking down fake content posted by one political candidate.Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey announced last month that the platform would ban all political ads, rather than moderate them. He said in a tweet that the reach of political messages ""should be earned, not bought"".However, Twitter clarified this policy last week, saying that while ads by candidates, political parties or elected government officials are not allowed, advertising by vetted news publishers will be permitted.Snapchat publishes a record of political and advocacy ads that have been run on its platform.According to the data from 2019, the presidential campaigns that have bought advertisements on the platform include:The Democratic National Committee has spent $630 on four ads, which have gained 147,894 views."
technology	Tech Tent: Taking 8chan offline	De-platformed	"It had already become known as a hate-filled message board used to celebrate mass shootings.Now, after the man arrested for the El Paso shootings allegedly used 8chan to post his white supremacist manifesto, service providers have said enough is enough.On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we look at 8chan's attempts to get back online and ask whose job it should be - if anybody's - to decide which sites should be barred from the web.8chan's notoriety has long sparked calls for it to be evicted from the web.They grew louder after an account believed to belong to the man behind the mass killing in Christchurch, New Zealand, posted an 87-page manifesto full of invective against immigrants and Muslims.Then last weekend, as news broke of the El Paso shootings - cheered on by some of the denizens of 8chan - the pressure on companies providing services to the site intensified.Even the site's founder said enough was enough. Fredrick Brennan, who cut ties to 8chan in 2018, told the BBC that the current owner should pull the plug.""I feel like this has to stop,"" he said.""I feel like they are not running 8chan in a proper way... they're not trying to stop these shootings, at least they're not trying hard enough.""In a YouTube video, 8chan's current owner Jim Watkins said he worked with law enforcement and complied with the law.But one of the service providers keeping the site online disagreed.On Sunday, Cloudflare - which protects 8chan and thousands of other organisations from denial of service attacks - dropped 8chan. The message board quickly disappeared from the public web.It was a rapid turnaround. Just the previous day, Cloudflare had said ending its relationship with 8chan would be ""problematic"".In a somewhat tortured blogpost, Cloudflare's chief executive Matthew Prince admitted that the company felt ""incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter"".He warned that 8chan was likely to find a way of getting back online very soon, just as the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer had when Cloudflare evicted it a few years ago.So far, however, it seems the efforts of the 8chan team to find a new home have proved unsuccessful.On Thursday, a system administrator tweeted: ""8chan is still down. Our machines were DDoSed [suffered distributed denial of service attacks] one-by-one.""Later came this: ""8chan is the first platform to be de-platformed. We are working hard to make sure that doesn't happen again after we come back online.""Underneath the tweets were plenty of supportive messages. Keep up the good fight, said one. It is clear that there is an audience waiting to rejoin a community which allows the sharing of hateful ideas.But working out at what stage - if ever - such communities should be driven offline is not easy.Poppy Gustafsson, co-CEO of the cyber-security firm Darktrace, tells Tech Tent that web service businesses find themselves facing a difficult dilemma.""Every business has the choice of who it does or doesn't transact with... but who should be regulated in the broader internet, that shouldn't be for individual businesses to decide.""Much depends on where a site and its support services are based.In the United States, with its First Amendment protection of free speech, there will always be a greater reluctance to shut down anything that is not illegal.There are no global rules on what is allowed online - and many may argue that they would be a very bad idea.So it is likely that 8chan or its replacements will be back online soon, owing to commercial decisions rather than any made by regulators."
technology	Fake news: BBC and tech firms join forces to fight disinformation		"Plans to help tackle so-called ""fake news"" have been announced by the BBC and some of the biggest names in journalism and technology.The new measures include an early warning system for use during elections or when lives may be at risk, extra online education and improved access to impartial resources for voters.Major publishers, Google, Twitter and Facebook have helped devise the scheme.The BBC said the moves were ""crucial steps"" in fighting disinformation.It follows criticism of big technology firms for failing to do enough to prevent the spread of ""false news"" - from scares about vaccines to stories manufactured to influence elections.Other recent events such as this year's Indian elections have also highlighted the dangers of disinformation and the risk it poses to democracy.Earlier this summer, the BBC convened a Trusted News Summit, bringing together senior figures from major global technology firms and publishing to help tackle the problem.The group drew-up new plans including:BBC Director General Tony Hall said: ""Disinformation and so-called fake news is a threat to us all. At its worst, it can present a serious threat to democracy and even to people's lives.""This summit has shown a determination to take collective action to fight this problem and we have agreed some crucial steps towards this.""Further details will be released at a later date."
technology	Tech firms must give up their awkward secret: Humans	‘We could add a comma’	"Among the thousands upon thousands of words that make up the privacy policies of the tech giants, one you rarely find is “human”.There are zero uses of the word in Amazon’s privacy policy for its Alexa voice assistant. The same goes for Apple’s Siri. And Google’s Assistant.Facebook’s policy uses the word just once - to inform you that it will record data about your device to make sure that you are human.Only Microsoft states what all of these other privacy policies arguably should: ""Our processing of personal data … includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.""I point this out because the issue of human labour is a touchy subject in Silicon Valley right now; a fresh atmosphere of controversy for which companies only have themselves to blame.First, Amazon was revealed to have been using human contractors to listen to clips picked up by Alexa. Then it was discovered Google was doing much the same, as were Apple. All three companies said they would halt the practice in response to the negative publicity.And then Facebook, it was reported by Bloomberg last week, was using humans to listen to recordings gathered via its Messenger app. The company insisted proper consent had been obtained, but subsequent reporting found that wasn’t quite accurate. Well, it wasn’t at all accurate. Facebook didn’t say a word about it to users.A final fallbackThe stories have dropped like dominoes. Any voice-powered or “automated” system is now quite rightly being put under scrutiny. Do Microsoft contractors sometimes listen to audio captured via Skype? Yep. Do they listen to audio of gamers speaking through their Xbox? Sure do.For reporters, the low-hanging fruit is everywhere you look. I picked an “automated” service I use often - Expensify, the expenses-logging app that can “smartscan” receipts - and looked into it. Did humans have any role in how it worked? Yes, it turns out they do.“SmartScan is a complex, multi-layered system that takes multiple approaches to extracting information from receipts,” the company told me.“The final, fallback approach is that it is sent to one of our contractors. When we're unable to extract the required information from the receipt, the receipt is reviewed by one of our contractors to fill in the missing information.”No mentions of humans in Expensify’s privacy policy, either.There is a reasonable explanation for all this - if only the egotistical, secrecy-obsessed tech giants could bring themselves to say it. Without humans, most of these products would suck.Expensify, to its credit, admitted to me that without human review, it would likely only manage about 80-85% accuracy. It would mean users would need to check all of their receipts for errors, defeating the point of using the software entirely. So, on balance, if a contractor has to step in once in a while - that’s fair. Not mentioning it anywhere on their website? Considerably less so.Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft all face the same challenge. Those companies capture these recordings not to spy on you, but to figure out when and why their technologies, still early in their development, get things wrong.But what’s most frustrating to me, is that I don’t think most people have a problem with that. I know I don’t: my expectation is that because these products aren’t perfect, firms need to work on improving them. It’s almost reassuring that humans are still so relied upon.But my other expectation is for tech companies to be up front about it, and on that, most have failed. I interviewed Amazon’s head of Alexa earlier this year and asked him if he felt Amazon could do more to make it clear in their privacy policy that humans had even just a minor role in Alexa’s systems.“I suppose we could add a comma after that and be more specific,” he told me (spoiler: they haven’t done that).Put it on the damn box, I say. Be honest.The tech industry needs to quickly understand that the tech-buying public will forgive them for using human labour, far more readily than it will for blatant and lazy abuses of trust.But then, doing so would mean admitting an imperfection, weakness or inefficiency. And that’s just not the done thing around here._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Data regulator probes King's Cross facial recognition tech	Fair and transparent	"The facial-recognition system at King's Cross is to be investigated by the UK's data-protection watchdog.Media exposure of live facial recognition at the site prompted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to look into how it was being used.The ICO will inspect the technology in place and how it is operated to ensure it does not break data protection laws.The regulator said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the growing use of facial-recognition technology.The Financial Times was the first to report a live face-scanning system was being used across the 67-acre (0.3-sq-km) site around King's Cross station in London.Developer Argent said it used the technology to ""ensure public safety"" and it was just one of ""a number of detection and tracking methods"" in place at the site.But the use of cameras and databases to work out who is passing through and using the site has proved controversial.So far, Argent has not said how long it has been using facial-recognition cameras, what is the legal basis for their use, or what systems it has in place to protect the data it collects.In its statement, the ICO said: ""Scanning people's faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives, in order to identify them, is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all.""The regulator said it was keen to ensure that King's Cross developer was using the technology in accordance with UK laws governing the use of data.""Put simply, any organisations wanting to use facial recognition technology must comply with the law - and they must do so in a fair, transparent and accountable way,"" said the ICO.It must have documented how and why it believed its use of the technology was legal, proportionate and justified, it added.Argent has not yet responded to a request for comment by BBC News.The mayor of London is also quizzing developer Argent about its use of facial-recognition systems.Sadiq Khan wrote to the company and said there was ""serious and widespread concern"" about the legality of facial recognition."
technology	Australia to police tech giants' algorithms		"Australian regulators plan to launch the world's first office dedicated to scrutinising algorithms used by tech giants such as Facebook and Google.The idea is to reveal how these companies match adverts to users.A new, special branch of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is to carry out the work.The announcement came just days after US authorities announced separate plans to investigate the tech giants.""These companies are among the most powerful and valuable in the world,"" said Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg.""They need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent.""He said it was time that people had a clearer understanding of how the tech giants' algorithms worked. Usually, the specifics of algorithms - calculations used by computers to make decisions - are closely guarded commercial secrets.Researchers have, in the past, claimed that Google's algorithms, for example, deliberately prioritise its own adverts in search results.The new ACCC branch was just one recommendation in a recent report from the commission. It also advocated strengthening privacy laws and establishing a code of conduct to restrict how tech firms profit from user content.A 12-week consultation process on the proposals is now under way, after which the Australian government can act on it.ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the regulator was currently running five separate investigations into Facebook and Google.He called for ""a lot more transparency and oversight"" of the two companies and added that breaking them up remained a possibility.Both firms said they would engage with regulators."
technology	Tech Tent: Is your face on a watch list?		"Is it a brilliant new law enforcement tool helping keep public spaces safe from criminals and terrorists? Or a creepy surveillance technology which threatens the privacy of people going about their lawful business?This week Tech Tent looks at the debate around facial recognition.It was the revelation that the development around London's King's Cross mainline station was tracking thousands of visitors using a facial recognition system that sparked new concerns about the technology. The site includes shops, offices - Google's UK HQ is there - and the Central St Martins art college.The story was a scoop from the Financial Times technology correspondent Madhumita Murgia, who is this week's Tech Tent special guest. She tells us property firm Argent, which owns the site, has refused to give any detailed information about how the system was used and, crucially, what kind of watch list was involved.The BBC also hit a brick wall when seeking answers - all we got was this from Argent: ""These cameras use a number of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition, but also have sophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public.""In the UK there have been a number of trials of facial recognition by police forces but campaigners are resisting its introduction. A legal challenge has been mounted against South Wales Police by someone who says their picture was taken while they were out shopping.Silkie Carlo, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, says there are clear dangers in the spread of the technology: ""This is inherently a surveillance tool that bends towards authoritarianism.""She points to China where she says facial recognition surveillance is used for social control, political policing and the persecution of the Uighur minority.But Zak Doffman, whose company Digital Barriers supplies facial recognition systems to a variety of customers insists that it serves a valuable purpose: ""If you talk to chief police officers, if you talk to people in security and defence, they will say that as a support technology for people on the ground, it is immensely valuable, if used properly.""But he stresses that there is a need for transparency: ""The question is what is the watch list and who is being watched on what basis?""He sees more problems with commercial use of the technology in public spaces, and says the King's Cross story has served to provoke a necessary debate about regulation.This debate is raging around the world as the technology becomes more pervasive. San Francisco has banned the use of facial recognition by the police and other city agencies. The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner, has launched an investigation into what is happening at King's Cross and whether data protection law has been broken.Whether it is at passport gates or logging into phones and online banking systems we are getting accustomed to using our faces to identify ourselves. But when it comes to being tracked without our knowledge in public spaces there is a growing revolt about the spread of this surveillance technology."
technology	Apple changes Crimea map to meet Russian demands	You might also be interested in:	"Apple has complied with Russian demands to show the annexed Crimean peninsula as part of Russian territory on its apps.Russian forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, drawing international condemnation.The region, which has a Russian-speaking majority, is now shown as Russian territory on Apple Maps and its Weather app, when viewed from Russia.But the apps do not show it as part of any country when viewed elsewhere.The State Duma, the Russian parliament's lower house, said in a statement: ""Crimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory.""Russia treats the naval port city of Sevastopol as a separate region.The BBC tested several iPhones in Moscow and it appears the change affects devices set up to use the Russian edition of Apple's App Store.Apple had been in talks with Russia for several months over what the State Duma described as ""inaccuracy"" in the way Crimea was labelled.The tech giant originally suggested it could show Crimea as undefined territory - part of neither Russia nor Ukraine.But Vasily Piskaryov, chairman of the Duma security and anti-corruption committee, said Apple had complied with the Russian constitution.He said representatives of the company were reminded that labelling Crimea as part of Ukrainian territory was a criminal offence under Russian law, according to Interfax news agency.""There is no going back,"" Mr Piskaryov said. ""Today, with Apple, the situation is closed - we have received everything we wanted.""He said Russia was always open to ""dialogue and constructive co-operation with foreign companies"".Apple has not yet commented on the decision.Google, which also produces a popular Maps app, also shows Crimea as belonging to Russia when viewed from the country. The changes happened in March.When Google Maps is viewed from Ukraine, the maps show no clear border between Crimea and Ukraine but also no border between Crimea and Russia, according to BBC Monitoring.Most of the international community, including the EU and the US, does not recognise the annexation of Crimea to Russia.The loss of Crimea is a deep wound for Ukrainians. Shortly after the peninsula was annexed in early 2014, a separate conflict broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions when separatists moved against the Ukrainian state.Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists.Moscow denies this but says that Russian volunteers are helping the rebels. More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict.The BBC does not show Crimea as part of Russia on its maps, but shows a dotted line to mark disputed territory."
technology	Tech firms face fines for harmful videos from regulator Ofcom		"The government is considering giving powers to fine video-sharing apps and websites to the UK's media regulator.The proposal would see Ofcom able to impose multi-million pound fines if it judges the platforms have failed to prevent youngsters seeing pornography, violence and other harmful material.The regulator would take charge of the matter from 19 September 2020.The move is designed to meet the UK's obligations to the EU but may not be required if Brexit occurs in October.Even then, it would only be an interim measure until a separate online harms regulator was appointed at a later date.""The implementation of the AVMSD [Audiovisual Media Services Directive] is required as part of the United Kingdom's obligations arising from its membership of the European Union and until the UK formally leaves the European Union all of its obligations remain in force,"" said a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.""If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, we will not be bound to transpose the AVMSD into UK law.""The Telegraph newspaper was first to report the scheme.It said that the proposal was ""quietly"" agreed before Parliament's summer break and would give Ofcom the power to fine tech firms up to 5% of their revenues and/or block them in the UK if they failed to comply with its rulings.The watchdog has said that it is ready to adopt the powers.""These new rules are an important first step in regulating video-sharing online, and we'll work closely with the government to implement them,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.""We also support plans to go further and legislate for a wider set of protections, including a duty of care for online companies towards their users.""Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have not commented.But TechUK - the industry group that represents the sector - said it hoped that ministers would take a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the issue.""Key to achieving this will be clear and precise definitions across the board, and a proportionate sanctions and compliance regime,"" said its deputy chief executive Antony Walker.The Internet Association added that it hoped any intervention would be proportionate.""Any new regulation should be targeted at specific harms, and be technically possible to implement in practice - taking into account that resources available vary between companies,"" said Daniel Dyball, the association's executive director.Child safety charity NSPCC has welcomed the announcement.""The immediacy of livestreaming can make children more vulnerable to being coerced by abusers, who may capture the footage, share it and use it as blackmail,"" commented Andy Burrows, head of the organisation's child safety online policy.""The directive gives the UK a chance to introduce tough measures on tech firms that have their European headquarters here.""Crucially, this is a real chance to bring in legislative protections ahead of the forthcoming Online Harms Bill and to finally hold sites to account if they put children at risk."""
technology	Tech Tent: Fun and games in Dundee	GTA 'afterthought'	"It is a small Scottish city with a population of under 150,000, but it is the birthplace of Grand Theft Auto and is now a major games hub.In a special edition of Tech Tent live from Dundee, we explore why this city punches above its weight in the games industry.We start with a tour of a major exhibition about video games at the city's V&A museum, which opened last year.Its opening exhibition was about ocean liners, a nod to the past of this port city - now visitors are thronging there to learn about a 21st century industry which is key to Dundee's future.We meet a young developer - Cari Watterton - and hear her tips for getting into the games business. Cari works for the wonderfully named Puny Astronaut, a games firm located in a new development on the Dundee waterfront.When we visited, we found Cari and her colleagues hard at work on a game called Skye, due to come out some time next year. She joined recently from Dundee's Abertay University, which is gaining an international reputation for training students in the skills the games industry needs.Her absolutely top tip for aspiring games industry workers? Get involved in a games jam - a kind of hackathon where you create a game within two days:""They're fantastic learning opportunities and a great way for you to learn new skills and develop your existing skills - and also working with people. You always end up with something at the end of it which you can add to your portfolio.""Puny Astronaut's founder Cian Roche tells us that many of his staff have been recruited from Abertay, where he also studied. Increasingly, a games industry which used to draw staff from all sorts of disciplines, is seeking people who have had specialised training.And people who come from across the UK to study here - Cian was brought up in Oswestry - sometimes stay and build new games businesses.Another person who has done just that is Paul Farley - he came from Weston-super-Mare to study architecture here in Dundee in the early 1990s, before playing a role in the creation of one of the greatest blockbuster titles in gaming history. I caught up with Paul this week 23 years after I first met him - although I confess I had no recollection of that meeting.In 1996 I came to Dundee for a week of reports for the BBC TV programme Working Lunch, visiting a different company each day. Our final stop was at a games company called DMA Design, which was working on a little game called…..Grand Theft Auto.The video of my visit still pops up from time to time on Twitter, so earlier this week I tweeted asking whether anyone in it was still in Dundee.Paul Farley, who is seen playing pool behind me at the start of the video, got in touch. He tells us that he joined DMA, having dropped out of his architecture course: ""I had a few friends there that were artists and said they were looking for someone to build some cities for a game.""But when he arrived he found that GTA was by no means the company's star project: ""We were working on a lot of projects with Nintendo and those were kind of sexy, cool projects that everyone was excited to work on. Grand Theft Auto was a little bit of an afterthought.""When I visited, the studio was in what is called the ""crunch"" stage of development with everyone working crazy hours to get the game shipped. In the event, the first Grand Theft Auto was not released until late the following year - maybe my visit set them back further.Paul went on to work on several versions of the game before starting his own business Tag Games, a pioneer in mobile and tablet gaming. He has also recently started a new venture Chili Connect, a live game management platform helping other developers run their streaming operations.Paul says this small city now has more game developers per head of population than anywhere in Europe. He gives a lot of credit to the presence of Abertay University and to a spirit of collaboration between the dozens of games businesses in the city: ""There is a competitive edge to it as well, but it's a very friendly competitive edge. We want to see each other do well.""With its new V&A museum, thriving universities and a higher proportion of 18 to 24-year-olds than any other Scottish city, Dundee appears well placed to build on its success as a creative hub for the games industry. All it needs now is to find the next Grand Theft Auto."
technology	Tech Tent: Should you trust smart machines?	High-quality	"Should you be asking a voice-activated speaker intimate questions about your health? And is it important that the scientists behind AI systems actually understand how they work?These are two questions we seek to answer in this week's Tech Tent podcast.""What are the symptoms of Parkinson's disease?""If you are a UK user putting that question to Amazon's voice-controlled speakers, the answer will probably now come from the NHS, thanks to a new partnership between the tech giant and the UK's National Health Service.In effect, what is happening is a simple web search that prioritises useful and accurate information.That may not sound controversial but immediately many people did raise concerns about the NHS working with a tech giant such as Amazon.""What I'm concerned about is that the NHS has sought a partnership with Amazon that seems to encourage people to give private health details to a company that profits from people's private data,"" Silkie Carlo from the campaign group Big Brother Watch tells the programme.Amazon insists it will not be sharing health data with third parties or using any health questions asked to target advertising at customers.But Carlo is not convinced.""How would they be able to differentiate between people searching for books and music and people searching for information about health concerns?"" she asks.If this means Amazon intends to create a separate dataset of people's health concerns, that is even more worrying, she says.But William Tunstall-Pedoe, whose company developed the software that became Alexa, takes a different view.He no longer has a connection with Amazon, but says people have been asking Alexa health questions for years and it is important that they get good answers.""This partnership means that the information is high-quality, clinician-led information from the NHS, where previously it might not have been,"" he says.He says it is legitimate to have concerns about how health data will be used, but the same worries apply to every search engine that we use to ask similar questions.As artificial intelligence and autonomous systems make rapid advances, two other problems are emerging.Sometimes the scientists behind AI are not really clear what is happening inside their black box systems. Sometimes technology users are not even aware that machines are making decisions without human intervention.Researchers at the Centre for Assuring Autonomy at the UK's York University call this phenomenon ""accidental autonomy"".The centre's director Prof John McDermid gives an example: the software that is being blamed for the two crashes involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft.""To avoid having to retrain pilots, Boeing decided not to tell them about the system thinking it would operate automatically in the background. In essence, they didn't need to know,"" he says.He says that with vital software, it is essential that the operators - the pilots in this case - understand what is happening and are able to take over control from the autonomous system if necessary.His colleague Dr Ana MacIntosh says there is a wider issue with understanding what is going on inside all sorts of complex AI systems.""The 'explainability' of the decisions which are being taken by systems is very different to having a conversation with a human who previously might have made those decisions,"" she says.""We don't understand in many cases how those decisions are being made.""Smart machines are playing a bigger role in everything from healthcare to air safety - but they are bringing with them new ethical dilemmas."
technology	Tech Tent: Robot rules for any Tom, Dick or Harry	Also on Tech Tent this week:	"Tom, Dick and Harry work in the fields. Each has a specific farming job to do but they share one thing in common - they are all robots.Now the company behind them has devised a set of rules about how they behave, one it hopes others may adopt.Mainly the rules refer to how robots need to serve humans but does one give them a glimpse of their own rights?On this week's Tech Tent we discuss what the blueprints for human/machine interaction should look like.The little farming robots do not come across many humans, other than the odd rambler, Ben Scott-Robinson, co-founder of the Small Robot Company, told us.But he still thinks the time is ripe to discuss how we want to interact with machines in future.""We're about to see a massive influx of commercial robots in the consumer domain. In our shops, our factories, our hotels, our streets and our fields. It's vital that consumers can trust and feel comfortable with these encounters,"" he said.The rules build on those created by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in his 1942 short story Runaround, where he decreed that an autonomous machine must not harm a person, always obey orders and protect its own existence without compromising its other principles.The new blueprints include these rules:But one of the rules hints at the potential need to give the robots themselves some rights:Mr Scott-Robinson told us this was not as revolutionary as it might sound: ""It's much more mundane. It is the same as if someone maliciously interferes with your car then the alarm goes off. If someone picks up or kicks a robot when it is going about its daily work, then the robot should be able to collect information about who is doing it and tell its user."""
technology	Tech Tent: Jony Ive's next chapter		"If one man has changed the way we see the gadgets we use every day it is Jony Ive. Now he is leaving Apple and on this week's Tech Tent we assess his contribution to the look and feel of consumer technology.The man behind the design of the iPhone, the iPod and countless other i-products was just another young designer at Apple's Cupertino headquarters when Steve Jobs returned to the company in 1997.Back then Apple's computers stood out because of their software. They were the only serious alternative to the ubiquitous Windows PCs - but their hardware was just as dull.Together, Ive and Jobs came up with their first big hit - the iMac, a computer that was both colourful and cute.Prof Jeremy Myerson from the Royal College of Art says Jony Ive is to industrial design and computing what David Hockney is to painting and Christian Dior to fashion.""Before Johnny Ive, computers were made of beige or grey plastic, they were cheaply made,"" he recalls.""The wonder was in what they could do functionally, not how they felt emotionally or what they looked like. And Jony Ive changed all that dramatically.""What Ive and Jobs shared was an obsession with detail - they even wanted the inside of a product, invisible to the user, to be consistent with Apple's design aesthetic.You can see that philosophy in the often-parodied product videos where Ive describes the Apple Watch as ""the most personal product we've ever made"" or raves about the contrast between the iPhone 4's ""textured back and its highly-polished chamfered edge"".His quiet, almost soporific voiceovers may have been much mocked, but Prof Myerson says every other firm has rushed to imitate Apple's approach to technology.""What he's done, he's made it personal, he's made it cool, he's made it attractive, and other companies have had no choice but to jump into that game.""With many products, it was design not technology that made them winners. Apple was not the first company to bring out a touchscreen phone or Bluetooth earbuds,But the iPhone and the AirPods immediately convinced millions of people that this was how they wanted a gadget to look and work.In recent years, however, it has sometimes seemed that Apple's obsession with the cleanest of lines in every product has come at the expense of usability.Buyers of the MacBook, which has just one USB-C port, have been forced to buy a clutch of adapters to plug in devices. Problems with the laptop's keyboard have also been linked to what one pundit described as ""Ive's obsession with device thinness and minimalism"".Sir Jonathan - he was knighted in 2012 - is stressing that he will continue to be involved in projects at Apple. As one wag tweeted: ""Jony Ive will still work with Apple but it will require a special adapter.""Still, if he never designs another breakthrough Apple product he will go down in history as the genius behind the most profitable product in history, the iPhone.Not bad for someone who started his career at a small UK consultancy designing toilets and toothbrushes.Also on this week's programme:In an extraordinarily frank interview Nokia's chief technology officer Marcus Weldon attacks its rival Huawei over what he describes as ""sloppy"" security.The interview was too frank for Nokia - after reading an account of what Mr Wheldon had said, the company issued a statement saying his comments ""did not reflect the official position of Nokia"".And as a report says machines will replace 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, we visit an event where robots that can do everything from walk upstairs to perform complex surgery are on display."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook’s deepfake dilemma	#deepfakeRegulation time?	"In a video on Instagram this week, Mark Zuckerberg confessed to controlling the stolen data of billions of people and said he owed it all to an organisation called Spectre.The video was of course faked, and on this week's Tech Tent we examine the dilemma it posed for Instagram's owner Facebook.A few weeks ago, the social media giant came under fire for allowing a doctored video of the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to remain up.So how would it react when the faked video of its founder emerged?The video featured the real Mark Zuckerberg, but the voice and the words emerging from his mouth were not his.It was the work of two artists, Daniel Howe and a man going by the name of Bill Posters, and was part of an installation on show in Sheffield this week.When we spoke to Bill Posters he told us that the video had been planned long before the row over Facebook's treatment of Nancy Pelosi.The aim was to throw a light on Facebook's business model, which involved using behavioural psychology to persuade people to share intimate details of their lives so that they could be targeted with advertising.""We're shining the light on Facebook and Zuckerberg himself to ask what happens now when it's your privacy and your data that's been used in obscure or unintended ways"" he said.Unsurprisingly, Facebook did not remove the video, It said it followed the same policy as with the Nancy Pelosi video and other misinformation on its services - let third party fact-checkers determine whether it was fake, and then make it less visible in users' feeds rather than taking it down.Bill Posters points out that the video featured the hashtag #deepfake and was never meant to deceive anybody.It is hard to believe that anybody happening across this artwork with a voice which sounds nothing like Mark Zuckerberg would be fooled.But month by month, deepfake technology is getting ever more sophisticated.Soon, it will become extremely difficult to spot whether words have been put into the mouths of politicians, or whether celebrities' faces have been placed in scenes where they were not present.Both identifying such videos and deciding what to do about them will become an even greater challenge for Facebook's moderators, while giving the company a powerful role in determining the limits of free expression.Bill Posters says that means things need to change.""To do that it needs collective understanding of very hard, obscure, hidden technologies and methods. But it also needs regulatory oversight as well,"" he said.The call for regulation of Facebook and the other US tech giants is getting louder - from Europe in particular.Tech Tent also hears from European Commissioner Carlos Moedas and leading UK tech figure Hermann Hauser, who both insist that Europe is setting the pace - with the GDPR data privacy directive just one example.And Hermann Hauser has one radical solution to the huge power and dominant market share of Google, Amazon and Facebook - break them up."
technology	Project Nightingale: Google accesses trove of US patient data	Privacy concerns	"Google has gained access to a huge trove of US patient data - without the need to notify those patients - thanks to a deal with a major health firm.The scheme, dubbed Project Nightingale, was agreed with Ascension, which hopes to develop artificial intelligence tools for doctors.Google can access health records, names and addresses without telling patients, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.Google said it was ""standard practice"".Among the data the tech giant reportedly has access to under the deal are lab results, diagnoses, records of hospitalisation and dates of birth.Neither doctors nor patients need to be told that Google can see this information.The Wall Street Journal reports that data access began last year and was broadened over the summer.In a blog, Google said its work with Ascension would adhere to industry-wide regulations, such as the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).""To be clear... patient data cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data,"" the firm added.Ascension, which runs 2,600 hospitals, said the deal would help it to ""optimise"" patient care and would include the development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support doctors.The company also said it would begin using Google's cloud data storage service and business applications known as G Suite.However, Project Nightingale has already attracted criticism from those who argue that it takes away patients' control of their own data.""There's a massive issue that these public-private partnerships are all done under private contracts, so it's quite difficult to get some transparency,"" said Prof Jane Kaye at the University of Oxford.""Google is saying they don't link it to their other data but what they're doing all the time is refining their algorithms, refining what they do and giving them[selves] market advantage.""Health organisations are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency and quality of care. Many are turning to AI in an effort to sharpen their services, but such moves have sometimes faced criticism over how sensitive patient data is handled.In the UK, a hospital was found to have broken the law when it failed to explain properly to patients how their data would be used in the development of a kidney disease app developed by Google's AI-focused subsidiary DeepMind.The tool, called Streams, was designed to flag up patients at risk of developing acute kidney injury."
technology	Tech Tent: Is Facebook the future of money?	In the doldrums	"Has Facebook's plan for a new crypto-currency proved that the bitcoin believers were right all along?That's just one of the big questions we seek to answer in this month's Tech Tent podcast, which is a special edition all about the Libra coalition and its implications for the wider crypto-currency scene.For the past 12 months, a small team at Facebook's headquarters in California has been planning something big. On Tuesday, they went public.The world was told that Libra, a new global currency for the internet, would make paying for things or transferring money across borders as simple and cheap as sending a text message.The announcement was accompanied by an avalanche of white papers, presentations and Q&As from Facebook and its Libra coalition partners. But many questions were left unanswered.Is Libra really a crypto-currency? How would the coalition build a fast and efficient blockchain infrastructure when the technology has so far proved cumbersome, power-hungry and hard to scale? And - crucially - who will make this currency safe and ensure it does not follow bitcoin in becoming a haven for crooks and terrorists?Today, we got an answer to this last question, in a BBC interview with the governor of the Bank of England.Mark Carney made it clear that central banks were determined not just to sit back and watch Libra happen.Mr Carney, who met Mark Zuckerberg to be briefed about Libra a few months ago, has given the plan a cautious welcome. He recognises the need for innovation in the global payments system.But he is clear that there will be rules from the start: ""Welcome to the world of finance. There is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity - people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected and we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists.""Facebook makes much of the fact that there are 1.7 billion people in the world who do not have a bank account. They face high costs and a cumbersome system when they want to send money to relatives far away.A host of technology companies have sought to address this issue in recent times. Among them is UK-based TransferWise. Its chief technology officer, Harsh Sinha, tells us Facebook's entry into this market is welcome.""We took an approach of connecting directly into local banking systems across the world,"" he tells us.""Facebook's coming at it from a different angle and trying to use blockchain technology. It's an interesting perspective - and I think time will tell how things progress.""He says there is a huge market to aim at, with room for lots of different approaches.But creating a new superfast blockchain and making sure the new system complies with regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing could be a lengthy and expensive process.The wider crypto-currency community is watching with interest.Until recently, bitcoin has been in the doldrums, hovering around the $3,000 (£2,300) mark after falling from a peak of nearly $20,000.But in the last month it has soared above $9,000 as rumours swirled about Facebook's impending arrival on the scene.Crypto-currency and blockchain advisor Kate Baucherel said there had been an expectation that Amazon or Apple, or some other tech giant, might take the plunge into crypto-currency. She said Facebook's move felt like ""a real paradigm shift in the landscape"".She admits that Libra - which is controlled by a central organisation - is a very different creature from the decentralised, open, neutral bitcoin. But she says there is a sustained rise in the use of crypto-currencies and in the application of blockchain technology, and Libra can only reinforce that trend.We invited Facebook to appear on this week's programme but the company directed us instead to its partners in the Libra coalition.The social media giant is all too aware that its recent data and privacy scandals mean winning trust in its ambitious currency plan will be tough. Its strategy seems to be to allow others to do the talking.But with US politicians already calling for a pause in the project, it does not seem to be working."
technology	Tech Tent: Why is 5G data capped?	Data cap anxiety?Also on the podcast this week...	"With a flash of fireworks and a song from rapper Stormzy, the UK welcomed the arrival of its first 5G mobile network.On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we explore the benefits this next-generation tech is supposed to bring, and ask whether people are likely to pay a premium to upgrade.In the race to launch the UK's first 5G network, it was BT-owned EE that got there first - although the service is only available in a handful of cities at the moment.To put it to the test, our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to Covent Garden in central London, to appear live on the BBC News channel via 5G video link.His broadcast went smoothly, although afterwards he revealed there had been a small technical hitch.Three days of testing the video-streaming technology had hit EE's data cap. The Sim card needed ""topping up"" before he could go on air.Despite one of the benefits of 5G being a huge increase in network capacity, all of EE's new price plans come with a data cap.The cheapest tariff - £54 a month with a £170 fee for a compatible handset - has a data cap of 10GB.We're told 5G will let us stream ultra-high definition 4K movies in an instant - but you would soon use up your 10GB allowance doing that.When the mobile networks first introduced data caps on 3G tariffs, it was touted by the networks as a necessary step for them to manage demand on congested networks.A cynic might suggest it was also a way to boost revenue, as the number of lucrative SMS text messages being sent dwindled.Are we about to see ""data cap anxiety"" carry over into the 5G era?The fast download speeds of 5G make it a good candidate for replacing fixed-line home broadband - but not with a restrictive data cap. Downloading one video game on a console could easily blow through 30GB of data.EE has not revealed its tariffs for 5G home broadband. But as the only player in the market right now, it can charge early adopters what it likes.EE told the BBC that some of its 5G tariffs included their biggest data allowances to date and that 10GB was ""plenty"" for many customers.It also offers customisable ""data passes"" so that video games or video streaming, for example, are not counted towards your data use.When Vodafone switches on its 5G service in the coming weeks, we may see some more competitive prices - and less restrictive data caps.Perhaps, with the increase in capacity promised by the next-generation tech, it will do consumers a favour and banish them entirely."
technology	Tech Tent: Apple, Lyft and feel-good tech		"I've got a proposition for you. Would you like to invest in my tech firm?It's never made a profit - oh, and there is the small matter of the $911m (£700m) it lost in 2018.Come back....Well, that sums up the fortunes of ride-share firm Lyft, a rival to Uber that isn't yet in the UK.And yet within minutes of its launch on the New York Stock Exchange (as Tech Tent went on-air) it had soared to a valuation of $30bn.Annabelle Timsit, from the news website QZ, told me on the latest programme that investors ""want to believe"" that after a couple of years of investment Lyft will start to turn a profit - and early indications suggested that she was right as we watched the share price shoot up.We also looked at Apple's big announcements earlier this week - not a gadget in sight but a number of new or enhanced services, including a credit card with some pretty competitive offerings.Are people sick of paying subscriptions, and why has Apple rushed out its TV streaming announcement without the details in place of how much it will cost?Finally, from grandparents discovering Facetime to new mums finding new friends, we ended the programme on a positive note - looking at tech that's genuinely served a good purpose.The BBC's Jane Wakefield highlighted the mapping start-up what3words which enabled the rescue of a mother and daughter in a car crash in a rural part of the UK.Annabelle Timsit nominated a wearable device from the University of Switzerland that will help doctors monitor children with health conditions who live in remote areas.As for me... I'm off to work on my investment proposition.Rory Cellan-Jones returns next week."
technology	Tech Tent - who’s spying on you?	Public safetyFace finding	"It was the week when we learned that a missed WhatsApp call could plant spyware on your phone and when San Francisco moved to ban facial recognition technology.On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.When WhatsApp's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had ""all the hallmarks"" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years.Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was ""pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company"".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.He says the spyware is quite insidious: ""Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.""NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour.The Israeli firm said in a statement: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.""The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.""Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the WhatsApp hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: ""We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.""Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: ""Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.""Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking.But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: ""The right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.""Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on."
technology	Tech Tent: Apple takes a stand on design		"Just as at every Apple event, every detail of the new Mac Pro was greeted with whoops and cheers - until it came to the price of one accessory. When they realised that they were being asked to pay $999 (£784) for a simple monitor stand, the crowd at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) fell silent.On Tech Tent this week we ask whether the sky-high price for a low-tech product shows Apple has lost touch with reality.The $5999 price of the computer itself - or even the $4999 for the display - did not shock the audience. After all, these are high-end products aimed primarily at customers in the design and video production world.But breaking out $999 for the stand, rather than bundling it with the monitor, felt arrogant - as if Apple was assuming its loyal fans would pay any price for anything bearing its logo.Of course it has already tested that theory with recent models of the iPhone climbing above the $1000 or, indeed, the £1000 mark. And if you want a Mac laptop, the entry-level MacBook Air now starts at $1199, or £1199 in the UK.Carolina Milanesi, of Creative Strategies, tells us the revolt against these kind of prices may start in Europe, rather than the United States. She believes European consumers are concerned not so much about the cost of the hardware itself, but the services that come with their devices.""The value that a consumer gets in the US is far superior to what they get elsewhere,"" she says. ""The services' rollout, from music to Apple Pay, and now the TV service, is not equal.""Ms Milanesi says the argument that you get plenty of extra value for the £1000 you pay for the phone does not stand up if you don't receive parity of service.Which brings us to the other big announcement from WWDC: the demise of iTunes, with users now diverted to Apple Music, Apple TV and the podcasts app.As someone who reported on the 2004 launch of the iTunes Store in the UK, interviewing both Steve Jobs and Alicia Keys, the scrapping of the media software was a nostalgic moment. The arrival of iTunes was the moment it became clear that the technology industry, rather than record labels, would decide the music business's future.But in recent years, iTunes turned into a clunky, bug-ridden mess - somehow signalling that Apple has struggled to keep up as the world moved away from downloads to streaming as their preferred means of consuming music and video.Now a business which has made huge profits from hardware is shifting its focus to services, with some success.But if consumers really are to continue to be drawn into the Apple ecosystem and to continue spending money on services on their iPhones, iPads and MacBook Airs, then the price of entry may have to come down."
technology	Tech giants 'failing' to protect children		"The world's largest technology companies have been accused of failing to protect children at risk of sexual abuse, an inquiry has heard.Facebook, Google, Apple, BT and Microsoft will all give evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse over the next 10 days.Alexis Jay, who chairs the inquiry, said it would consider ""the adequacy of the response of the internet industry"" to the online facilitation of abuse.The hearing opened earlier on Monday.Opening the proceedings, legal counsel Jacqueline Carey outlined some harrowing examples of child grooming online and its devastating impact on their lives.She also told the inquiry:William Chapman, representing three victims of online abuse - two of whom are brother and sister - told the inquiry ""the largest tech firms are failing"" to prevent children at risk of sexual abuse.""Is it really beyond the wealth and wit of these technology companies to prevent and detect child sexual abuse on their platforms?"" he said.""Or is there something incompatible with their commercial objectives... their culture and ideology... that makes them bridle at the necessary steps to curb this modern scourge?""Ms Carey spoke of some of the measures technology companies had implemented, including the hashing of images, which provides a digital fingerprint of them so they can be identified if circulated.One victim, speaking anonymously, said her abuser had contacted her via Facebook and Twitter messages but she had not reported it to the social networks.""You just think, I'm on my own, how can they help?"" she said.At the weekend, Chief Constable Simon Bailey called for a boycott of social media."
technology	Black Friday and Cyber Monday: Tips to get the best deals	Be realisticBargain checkingStay secureFashion savvyRemember your rights	"Black Friday is upon us and this year many retailers have extended their deals for the whole week.And hot on its heels will be Cyber Monday, a phrase coined back in 2005 when online shopping needed promotion, but is increasingly becoming less relevant.There will be bargains to be had but shoppers need to keep their wits about them. Here are some top tips.You're unlikely to get 50% off the latest iPhone.Newer products are still going to sell well at their original price so there is less incentive for firms to put them on offer - especially tech devices.Consumer website Which? also suggests being cautious about apparently amazing offers on unknown brands.It found that one in five Black Friday shoppers did not read any reviews of the products they bought and advised people to do their research and be wary of unusual brands.Watch out too for unfamiliar stores that significantly undercut their rivals.Trustpilot and Reviews.co.uk are two popular sites where you can draw on past customers' experiences.In addition, it can be worth double-checking whether the retailer is based outside the EU as that might signal they are selling ""grey market"" items that the manufacturer's regional division will not fix or replace if something goes wrong.Sending a camera or phone back overseas for repair could easily wipe out any savings you might make.If you do spot a good deal, bear in mind that some stores change their prices several times a day, so it may not last.In some cases you can guard against this by sticking the product in your shopping cart before double-checking it's a bargain by searching elsewhere.If the store puts the price up in the meantime, you should still be able to complete the deal at the earlier advertised cost. And if it's gone down, you can empty the basket and then add the product back in again to take advantage of the change.There are also several websites, apps and browser plug-ins that can aid you on your shopping quest.One of the most famous is camelcamelcamel, which allows you to see a product's historic prices on Amazon and set up alerts to tell you if it drops to a desired price point.Keepa offers a similar service. You have to log in to use it, but it offers simple ways to check if prices are cheaper on eBay as well as providing an opportunity to dive deeper into the data.If you prefer Argos to the US retail giants, you should try PriceHistory instead. It lists past prices for items sold by the UK chain rather than drawing you charts, but has a clear user interface and also highlights the biggest reductions of the day by product category.Voucher codes can also help cut prices further.There's plenty of sites to find them, but you can also speed up the process by adding an extension such as Pouch or PriceBlink, which automatically flag relevant codes for the online store you are currently visiting. Alternatively, Honey promises to carry out a voucher-scan of its own at checkout and automatically fills in the best code for you if one is available.In addition, you can draw on other people's bargain-spotting skills by checking out HotUKDeals, LatestDeals.co.uk and the MoneySavingExpert forums - all of which offer finds and comments submitted by other members of the public.And you could always abandon your basket, by filling it and then not checking out. Sometimes retailers entice you to finish the purchase by offering further discounts.Beware of email deals that sound too good to be true if you just click that link - and check website addresses very carefully.""Making a website look identical to a well-known retail brand is horribly easy,"" says Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""Try not to use a link in an email but rather go to the web address you know.""He also advises keeping an eye on your statements in the aftermath of the sales to make sure nobody else has helped themselves to your card details.Lots of high street shops are offering deals on chothes and again price comparison websites can help find the cheapest prices.If buying online, users can opt to collect items from stores to save a delivery charge and also take advantage of cashback sites such as Quidco.com which offers a £15 bonus when shopping via it at over 4,500 brands.If you buy anything online you have 14 days to change your mind and get a complete refund, says Sarah Pennells, editor of the consumer finance website Savvy Woman.""You may have to pay to return the item, but if the retailer doesn't tell you whether or not you'll have to pay return postage, it's free,"" she says.Ms Pennells also advises paying on a credit card for purchases worth more than £100 (and less than £30,000) as you are better protected if the firm goes bust or you don't receive your item, than you would be if you paid by debit card."
technology	Use of facial recognition tech 'dangerously irresponsible'	Lost lesson	"Black and minority ethnic people could be falsely identified and face questioning because police have failed to test how well their systems deal with non-white faces, say campaigners.At least three chances to assess how well the systems deal with ethnicity were missed over the past five years, the BBC found.Campaigners said the tech had too many problems to be used widely.""It must be dropped immediately,"" said privacy rights group Big Brother Watch.Several UK police forces have been trialling controversial new facial recognition technology, including automated systems which attempt to identify the faces of people in real time as they pass a camera.Documents from the police, Home Office and university researchers show that police are aware that ethnicity can have an impact on such systems, but have failed on several occasions to test this.The Home Office said facial recognition can be an ""invaluable tool"" in fighting crime.""The technology continues to evolve, and the Home Office continues to keep its effectiveness under constant review,"" a spokesman told the BBC.The ability of facial recognition software to cope with black and ethnic minority faces has proved a key concern for those worried about the technology, who claim the software is often trained on predominantly white faces.Minutes from a police working group reveal that the UK police's former head of facial recognition knew that skin colour was an issue. At an April 2014 meeting, Durham Police Chief Constable Mike Barton noted ""that ethnicity can have an impact on search accuracy"".He asked CGI, the Canadian company managing the police's facial image database, to investigate the issue, but subsequent minutes from the working group do not mention a follow-up.Facial recognition was introduced on the Police National Database (PND), which includes around 13 million faces, in 2014.The database has troubled privacy groups because it contains images of people subsequently cleared of any offence. A 2012 court decision ruled that holding such images was unlawful.The ""unlawful"" images are still held on the PND. The government is currently investigating ways to purge them from the system.Despite this, the PND facial recognition system, provided by German company Cognitec, has proved very popular.The number of face match searches done on the PND grew from 3,360 in 2014 to 12,504 in 2017, Freedom of Information requests to the Home Office have revealed.In 2015, a team of assessors from the Home Office tested the PND facial search system, using about 200 sample images. They had identified ethnicity information about the sample photos but, once again, failed to use this opportunity to check how well the system worked with different skin colours.The same Home Office report also estimated that, across the entire PND, about 40% of the images were duplicated.It noted that this meant the UK government has overpaid hundreds of thousands of pounds to Cognitec, because the company charges more once the number of images (or ""templates"") on the database exceeds 10 million.The Home Office assessment also found the facial recognition system was only half as good as the human eye. It said: ""Out of the initial 211 searches, the automated facial search of PND identified just 20 true matches, whereas visual examination by the tester identified a total of 56 matches.""Cognitec declined to comment on costs, but said its matching technology had improved since the Home Office report, and that facial recognition results always required review by a human.A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said the technology had the potential to disrupt criminals, but said any roll-out must show its effectiveness within ""sufficient safeguards"". It added that work is being done to improve the system's accuracy and remove duplicates.Another chance to check for racial bias was missed last year during trials by South Wales of real-time facial recognition software, which was used at sports events and concerts. Cardiff University carried out an assessment of the force's use of the technology,That study stated that ""due to limited funds for this trial"", ethnicity was not tested.Cardiff's report noted, however, that ""during the evaluation period, no overt racial discrimination effects were observed"", but said this may be due to the demographic make-up of the watch lists used by the force.In addition, an interim report by a biometrics advisory group to the government considering ethical issues of facial recognition highlighted concerns about the lack of ethnic diversity in datasets.Under-representation of certain types of faces, particularly those from ethnic minorities, could mean bias ""feeds forward"" into the use of the technology, it said.Silkie Carlo, director of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ""The police's failure to do basic accuracy testing for race speaks volumes.""Their wilful blindness to the risk of racism, and the risk to Brits' rights as a whole, reflects the dangerously irresponsible way in which facial recognition has crept on to our streets.""The technology had too many problems to justify its used, she said.""It must be dropped immediately,"" Ms Carlo added.Big Brother Watch is currently taking legal action against the Metropolitan Police over its use of automated facial recognition systems."
technology	Tech Tent: Can YouTube fix its algorithms?	Disappointing revenueAlso on this week's podcast:	"YouTube is probably the most influential media business for a youth audience. But on this week's Tech Tent podcast, we ask whether Google is struggling to police its platform.If you ask people my age what they think is the world's most important and powerful TV firm, they might suggest Fox, Netflix or perhaps even the BBC.But for anyone under 30, the answer could well be YouTube. They might even single out individual personalities who attract huge audiences to their channels, such as video gamer PewDiePie.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of YouTubers. His book examines the rise of this new generation of TV superstars, who earn huge sums through advertising and sponsorship.He compares these influencers to 1950s news presenters such as Walter Cronkite, who addressed viewers in their homes each night, making them feel they had a personal connection.""Marketers are really starting to wake up to that and realise that if they can get their products in front of these people, then they're selling loads,"" he says.But an audience often made up of teenagers and young children is in thrall to a medium that could be far more addictive than old-fashioned telly.The YouTube algorithm is designed to encourage people to keep watching for longer. It sometimes leads viewers to watch ever more extreme content.The behaviour of some of these influencers on a largely self-regulated platform has raised concerns.Logan Paul, whose YouTube channel has nearly 20 million subscribers, was forced to apologise after filming a body hanging in a Japanese forest.PewDiePie, perhaps YouTube's biggest star, has come under fire for using anti-Semitic imagery as punchlines in jokes.This kind of scandal has occasionally seen advertisers step back from YouTube. But generally the platform and its owner Google have faced a lower level of scrutiny over abusive content than Facebook or Twitter, when it has a bigger young audience than either of them.Chris Stokel-Walker says Google tends to be reactive rather than proactive when it comes to cleaning up YouTube.""They are taking each scandal as it comes and trying to fix things as and when they happen,"" he says.YouTube may worry that cracking down on extreme content comes at a cost.Google's disappointing advertising revenue growth this week was blamed in part by chief financial officer Ruth Porat on fewer than expected clicks on YouTube ads.She said this reflected changes made last year which the company believed were ""overall additive to the user and advertiser experience"".This was thought to be a reference to a tweak to the platform's algorithms, which made ""harmful"" - but compelling - content less likely to appear in the recommended videos feed.YouTube has three constituencies - the users, the creators and the advertisers. Keeping them all happy while avoiding unfavourable publicity is going to be ever more challenging."
technology	Tech Tent: What is Uber's route to profit?	Also on this week's podcast:	"It is losing huge amounts of money with no clear path to profitability, a goal which the company itself admits it may never reach.On this week's Tech Tent, we ask why Uber was valued at $82bn (£63bn).As Uber makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, its valuation may be less than the $100 billion that was talked about just a few weeks ago.But it still represents a brave bet on stellar growth over the coming years.Think of it like this: you call up an Uber and get in to find the driver has no clear idea of how long the journey will take, what the best route is or how much it might cost.That is the position potential investors find themselves in, after wading through a prospectus full of ambitious statements of intent about capturing a sizeable chunk of markets worth $12trillion, but short on details about how to get there.Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, an investor in early stage technology firms, admits she struggles to see the case for buying Uber at the current valuation.But she says most investors will be taking a very short-term view: ""They're thinking, if I get into this stock, if I buy this stock at a certain price, how long do I hold it for me to sell and make some kind of a return?""As for the longer-term view and Uber's route map to profitability, she tells us that is murky. Making money from ride-sharing probably means taking the drivers out of the equation.Uber has spent big sums on research into driverless cars. It currently has little to show for it apart from a fatal crash that damaged its reputation.With any move to an autonomous fleet some years away, it has to keep drivers happy in the meantime. Demonstrations in a number of cities this week are evidence that this will be a challenge.At a rally in Uber's home town of San Francisco, one driver was not impressed with what he had heard about the initial public offering (IPO), which will make billions for the firm's founder and backers, but not so much for the drivers.""The math doesn't make sense man. This is Silicon Valley nonsense. If you're a viable company worth 90 billion, why can't you pay your employees?""The Uber bulls will point to the scepticism that surrounded the stock market debuts of Amazon, Google and Facebook, and the eye-popping returns that those companies eventually delivered to shareholders.Eileen Burbidge says Uber seems to think that its sheer scale will eventually earn it huge profits, even if that is not from its core taxi-hailing business.""I think it believes that it will have distribution, reach and market attention and market share in such a large global footprint, that over time it will come up with areas of the business that will be profitable, and that will make the company a growing and sustainable concern.""In other words, don't worry, something will come up... even if we have not thought of it yet."
technology	Tech Tent - Sri Lanka’s social media ban	Also on this week's programme:	"Even a year ago a government move to block access to social media would have been greeted with a global outcry.On Tech Tent this week we look at why the Sri Lankan government's ban has received a more muted response.The move to block the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube came in the wake of the devastating bombing attacks on Christian worshippers and tourists in Sri Lanka, which killed more than 250 people.Previous attempts by governments to curb internet access have been seen by liberal commentators as dangerous attacks on online freedoms. But here's the headline on a New York Times column by technology journalist Kara Swisher: ""Sri Lanka Shut Down Social Media. My First Thought Was 'Good'.""She said she was ashamed to admit it, but the social-media platforms' role in spreading hate and misinformation had made her welcome their temporary disappearance.The column reflected a wider disillusionment with the idea that the web is a force for good.During the Arab Spring, Facebook was hailed as a vital new weapon in the battle against authoritarian governments.Now, after it was used to incite violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar and to broadcast the murderous spree of the Christchurch gunman, it is seen in a much darker light.But from a Sri Lankan blogger and social-media activist we get a more nuanced view. ""The jury is out,"" Sanjana Hattotuwa tells us when we ask for his views on the ban.He created the country's first citizen-journalism site to record the failings of government and attacks on civil liberties but he accepts that many had welcomed the social-media blackout.""I think there was an acknowledgement that what the government did would aid in the containment or the controlling of the spread of misinformation,"" he says.But he believes that as time goes on, the ban could actually hinder the useful role social networks can play. ""The longer the block is in place, the more debilitating it becomes for families grieving in this unprecedented time to communicate with each other.""And also the larger public perception [is] that it is actually a means that the government uses to control or contain a growing unpopularity and public criticism of its inaction leading up to the terrorist attacks.""Mr Hattotuwa acknowledges that there is a debate to be had about the harms caused by social media but says it has become a vital means of communication in a country where the government and mainstream media are not trusted.Last year, as anger spread over the various data and privacy scandals, the hashtag #deletefacebook trended in some Western countries.But Mr Hattotuwa doesn't believe that will happen in his country. ""That will never ever have resonance in a country like Sri Lanka, where social media is inextricably intertwined into the DNA of politics and society,"" he insists."
technology	Tech Tent: Let the 5G battle commence		"The 5G era has finally begun. Both the United States and South Korea claim they have won the race to launch the first commercial next-generation mobile network.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we assess those claims and ask how important it is to be first with this technology.South Korea was long expected to be first with 5G. It is a technological powerhouse with ultra-fast broadband, home to giant firms such as Samsung and a government that sees leading the world in connectivity as a matter of national pride.Three networks were due to launch commercial 5G services on Friday when news emerged that an American operator was trying to steal their thunder.With quite a fanfare, Verizon launched its service on Wednesday in very limited areas of Chicago and Minneapolis.So the South Korean operators moved their launches forward to the same day, although it appeared that only a handful of celebrities were able to use it on the first day.In both South Korea and the US, these are largely symbolic launches because just about nobody has a 5G-enabled mobile phone yet.But Ronan Dunne, president of Verizon Wireless, told Tech Tent that more than 30 US cities would be covered by the end of 2019. Half a dozen 5G handsets will be available.""We think the adoption rate and the pace at which coverage will grow will be even faster than we have seen in the past,"" he said.Telecoms expert Simon Forrest, from Futuresource Consulting, still thinks South Korea will make faster progress rolling out 5G than the United States, partly because the operators there have united to build the network.""They're working in unison to deliver services, whereas in somewhere like the US, each of those operators is competing with the other and building their own separate networks.""He explains that South Korea and many other countries are using parts of the wireless spectrum best suited to reasonably fast, fairly wide coverage. This is known as the coverage capacity layer.In the United States, these ideal frequencies are largely occupied by the Department of Defense. Verizon is instead relying on millimetre wave, which offers very high speeds in a limited area. That means building a lot of new masts and that may be easier in some places than others.When 4G arrived, Asian countries were well ahead when it came to rolling out the new networks.This time the United States and Europe look well-prepared and a number of operators are planning to launch 5G in the second half of this year.What is still far from clear is just how eager consumers will be to pay for a technology that has been marketed as a solution for connecting things rather than people to the internet.Also on the podcast:"
technology	Tech Tent: The WWW turns 30		"In March 1989, a computer scientist at the Cern particle physics lab near Geneva submitted a proposal to his boss who scrawled ""vague but exciting"" on the document.From that idea, the world wide web was born, and on this week's Tech Tent we celebrate its 30th birthday - and examine whether it can emerge from what its creator calls a downward spiral which has seen it become a vehicle for hatred and misinformation.That creator is, of course, Sir Tim Berners-Lee and we travelled to Geneva to the data centre in Cern to talk to him about what drove him to create the web as well as his concerns about its current trajectory and his plan to put things right.Sir Tim took a 40-hour journey to celebrate the web's birthday and travelled from Switzerland to London's Science Museum and then on to Lagos in Nigeria.We dropped in on the Science Museum celebration to speak to three women with different perspectives on the web's history. Dame Wendy Hall, a computer scientist who has worked with Sir Tim since the early days of the web, shares many of his concerns about its current state.She admits they may have been too optimistic about human nature, but she still believes that ideas such as giving people more ownership of their data can give the web a healthier future.Marieme Jamme, the first black woman to sit on the board of the Web Foundation, and tech entrepreneur Roya Mahboob, from Afghanistan, both take a very positive view of what the web has done for them.Ms Jamme contrasts her life as a 13-year-old trafficked on to the streets of Paris before the web era with today when she is able to use the internet to combat trafficking and get information to girls.Ms Mahboob told us that using the web for the first time at 16 was like leaving ""digital darkness"", connecting to the rest of the world and allowing her to set off on the path to becoming an entrepreneur.And we take a journey into a very different web - the Chinese version. James Griffiths, author of The Great Firewall of China, explains how the Chinese authorities have managed to impose a very rigid system of censorship while still having a thriving web culture and some extremely powerful social media firms.The web visionaries had a utopian vision of a borderless world where information flowed freely. But China has proved that you can make the web bow to a government's demands, and other authoritarian regimes are looking at its model with great interest."
technology	Tech Tent: Should we relax about screen time?	Robust study	"The UK government's plans for regulation of the internet and social media contained a long list of online harms. Among them was excessive screen use by teenagers.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether there is convincing evidence that spending hours staring at smartphones and other screens is damaging the mental health of young people.If you read news headlines - or indeed the government's Online Harms White Paper - you might think that the case against screen time was a no-brainer.But this week, a study by the Oxford Internet Institute suggested that it had little obvious effect on the mental wellbeing of teenagers, even if they were spending hours staring at screens at bedtime.""We look at general wellbeing,"" one of the researchers, Amy Orben, tells us. ""We do not find a relationship between digital screen use 30 minutes, one hour and two hours before bed and a decrease in wellbeing.""The research examined data from more than 17,000 teenagers in the UK, Ireland and the United States.Ms Orben tells us that, unlike some other studies, their work does not rely solely on what people report about their own screen time.""People are really bad at estimating how much they use phones and technology in their everyday life,"" she explains""We've actually seen in previous research that the overlap between their self-reported phone use and their actual use when it is tracked is absolutely minimal.""Critics have pointed out that some of the Oxford data dates back to 2011. Since then, adolescents' screen time and the nature of what they are viewing has changed.There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that no matter how long teenagers are spending looking at screens, they are encountering material about issues such as anorexia and self-harm that could prove damaging to their mental health.The Oxford researchers are confident that their study is robust in its finding that any correlation between screen time and mental health is very small.""That crucially does not mean that I'm saying that there might not be a type of digital technologies that is harmful, or is very beneficial,"" says Ms Orben. But she says more research is needed.""I think this study is only a first step. We need to be asking better questions.""Meanwhile, whatever the evidence, the drive to regulate the internet is gathering pace.Also on this week's podcast:Stream the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook’s Planned Privacy Pivot	Facing factsAlso on this week's podcast:	"Suddenly the whole idea that we want to share our lives with the world has gone out of fashion. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg says he wants to create a privacy-focused platform.Meanwhile campaigners are warning that facial recognition technology poses a threat to our privacy when we are out and about.On this week's Tech Tent we ask whether privacy - both online and in the real world - has moved up everyone's agenda.You may have thought Facebook's whole mission was about getting us to live our lives in public - or ""Sharing is Caring"" as the slogan of the fictional social media company in the novel The Circle had it.But that is all going to change, according to Mr Zuckerberg. In a 3,000-word blogpost, he outlined a somewhat vague ""pivot"" to privacyHis plan involves more encryption, safer storage of data so information is not held in countries with poor records on privacy, and less permanence - in other words Facebook will follow Snapchat in making your posts disappear from its platform after a while.He compares it with moving from the digital equivalent of a town square - a public space - to the digital equivalent of the living room shared with only close friends..Given the series of privacy scandals which have battered the social media giant over the last few years, this new approach was bound to be met with cynicism - indeed Mr Zuckerberg himself admitted ""frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services"".And there are plenty of questions, How will Facebook balance its aim of giving users greater privacy through encryption with the need to police behaviour such as child abuse? The UK charity the NSPCC has already accused Mr Zuckerberg of taking ""a breathtakingly cavalier attitude towards child safety"".The UK charity said bringing end-to-end encryption to all of Facebook's messaging apps was ""handing groomers a largely unchecked ability to target children across multiple apps"".What is also not clear is just how Facebook's business model, which depends on knowing a lot about each of its users to target adverts, will be affected if they are being encouraged to share less of their lives.Dr Martin Moore, of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King's College London, tells us that Mr Zuckerberg may be looking to China for inspiration.He points out that the messaging service WeChat, owned by Tencent, has built all sorts of services on its platform along with a payment system: ""WeChat now has about 900 million WeChat Pay users and takes a cut every time they use it."" He says this kind of business model beyond advertising may look attractive to Facebook.Our other angle on the privacy issue is the debate over facial recognition technology. We visit the Tate Modern art gallery in London for an event where children are shown how easy it it is to fool facial recognition cameras by adjusting hair or make-up so they can no longer see what they recognise as a human face.The aim, says Frederike Kaltheuner of Privacy International, is twofold - to show how unreliable the technology is and to question whether its use is appropriate. She does not want people to alter their appearance: ""Our view is privacy is not about hiding - we want people to be open and transparent but on their terms.""But she says that transparency is becoming impossible: ""Facial recognition is essentially identification at a distance - we are all turning into walking ID cards.""She sees all sorts of issues as the technology is used more widely, perhaps in shops to check staff are smiling or to monitor customer behaviour: ""I think that's not a desirable future.""But we get a very different view from Zak Doffman, whose British company Digital Barriers supplied facial recognition technology for the Brit Awards at London's O2.He says it worked well and served an important purpose in spotting people seen as a potential threat: ""I feel that the balance of public consent would be that it is appropriate and proportionate to use technology to try and detect those people and prevent them from getting in.""But he says there does need to be a public debate about the circumstances in which facial recognition can be used. And when I put to him that scenario about retailers tracking customers, he says that would make him too feel very uncomfortable. ""That's incredibly creepy,""He says without checks and balances ""we are stepping into slightly dangerous territory for the future""."
technology	Huawei: ARM memo tells staff to stop working with China’s tech giant	What is ARM?‘Unfortunate situation’'Insurmountable obstacle'	"UK-based chip designer ARM has told staff it must suspend business with Huawei, according to internal documents obtained by the BBC.ARM instructed employees to halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagements” with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown.ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide.In a company memo, it said its designs contained “US origin technology”.As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban.One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an “insurmountable” blow to Huawei’s business.He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARM’s underlying technology, for which it pays a licence.These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones.Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workers and lists eight offices in the US.In a statement on Wednesday it said: ""ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant.""ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter.""Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own.""We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions,"" it said.""We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world.""ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK.ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others.In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or ""instruction sets"", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs.In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip.As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved.ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts.Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn?ARM’s staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Department’s move to add Huawei to its “entity list” of companies with which American firms could no longer do business.The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban.On Monday 20 May, US government officials issued a 90-day reprieve on some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it.A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts.According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries.It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an “unfortunate situation”, they were not allowed to “provide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entities”.ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must “politely decline and stop” any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules.The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region.Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its “plan B” for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality.Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSilicon’s chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM.While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future.HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said.Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers, which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients.In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based.""The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware,"" commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media.He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions.""This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's,"" he said.""It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G.""The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARM’s headquarters in Cambridge, UK.""ARM is the foundation of Huawei’s smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight.""That said, with an abundance of companies in Huawei’s supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huawei’s ability to operate was already severely affected.”What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department.""If that interpretation is correct, that’s going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,” remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit.""They’re not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.”_______Additional reporting by Leo KelionFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Tech Tent: Google comes out to play		"It is the search giant which is pouring billions into everything from mobile phones to artificial intelligence and driverless cars,Now Google wants to transform the video games industry and on this week's Tech Tent we explore whether its new service Stadia really does mean the death of the console.The pitch as delivered at the Games Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday seemed simple but compelling. Google was offering a streaming gaming service which would give you access to all kinds of hot titles on any kind of screen with all the heavy lifting being done in the cloud. Bye bye console, hello a kind of Netflix for games.But before we consign all those Xboxs, PlayStations and Nintendo Switches to the dustbin of history, there are a few questions to be answered. Will most gamers' broadband connections be fast enough to make a streaming service an attractive proposition? Will developers all come on board? And is Google the right company to trust with the future of the games industry?Keza MacDonald, games editor at the Guardian, has her doubts. She makes the point that while Netflix viewers will tolerate occasional buffering of TV programmes, gamers will find that intolerable: ""What makes the game nice to play is the instant responsiveness. So even the tiniest little bit of lag or delay, or stuttering or anything like that will ruin it.""Phil Harrison, the Google executive in charge of Stadia, says the service will use ""some very clever compression algorithms inside our data-centres to make sure we deliver the highest quality experience to you at the best possible bandwidth.""While the menu of games outlined at the launch looked thin, he promised that big titles from major publishers would be coming to the platform in the coming months. But Google can't expect the established players to sit back and watch as it steals their lunch.Microsoft is preparing its own streaming service, and neither the Xbox nor Sony's PlayStation are going to fade away any time soon.Google certainly has both the funds and the technology to make a success of a cloud gaming service. But there are questions about its track record when it comes to products that people have to pay for. Its Pixel phones have won good reviews but modest sales, Google Glass was an expensive flop and can anyone remember what happened to the Google TV service?Keza MacDonald also questions how comfortable gamers will be with a firm whose business has been built on collecting personal data to sell advertising: ""The idea of a Netflix-style subscription service that's also essentially mining my data and selling it, is not awesome.""Then there is the question of Stadia's link with YouTube, where Google has struggled to combat abuse and hateful behaviour. The platform will be both a powerful marketing channel for the streaming service and a source of reputational risk if young players face bullying.There will be a need for substantial investment in moderators to ensure a safe environment.Despite all these problems, Keza MacDonald believes a streaming service is an idea whose time has come: ""If anyone can make it happen, surely it's Google.""Also on this week's programme:Stream the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds"
technology	Tech Tent: Do we want our cities to be smart?		"These days it seems every city wants to be smart. That seems to mean putting sensors in everything and collecting vast amounts of data with the aim of making urban life more efficient and environmentally friendly.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we examine the smart city phenomenon. We hear from people who believe it promises it a greener future, and from one city where privacy campaigners believe it is giving more power to private companies for surveillance.In Milton Keynes, we visit the Electric Vehicle Experience Centre. It is part of the town's campaign to get more of its motorists to go electric.Visitors are shown a variety of cars, get information about range and charging options and - for a small fee - they can even borrow a car for a few days.If they decide to buy a car, the local council may offer a charger on a lamp-post - also for a small fee, of course - or point the motorist to charging stations nearby.There is even a plan to build a fast charging station which will give a full charge in five minutes, though that depends on new technology expected to arrive in electric vehicles over the next year.Brian Matthews, head of transport innovation at Milton Keynes Council, hope to allay common concern such as ""the price of the vehicles, how they will charge them, and range anxiety"".It seems to be working. Uptake of electric vehicles in the town is running at twice the UK average.Milton Keynes' other smart city initiatives include a trial of delivery robots that take small grocery orders to customers along the town's pavements.There are also autonomous pods that will soon be shuttling drivers between car parks in an attempt to keep traffic out of the town centre.One thing they have not tried is electric scooters. They are now common in US and Chinese cities, but illegal on British streets under a law dating back to the 19th Century.We visit Paris, where a clutch of e-scooter rental firms - many from California - are competing for business.Parisians seem enthusiastic about this relatively cheap and green way of making short journeys. But there are already problems emerging .The pavements are cluttered with dozens of scooters. People are riding them without helmets, sometimes with children perched on the front. It also looks as though there is an investment bubble that could see firms go bust, leaving the city with a mess to clear up.And while we have heard plenty of enthusiasm for the idea of using technology and data to make cities a lot smarter, in Toronto there is something of a backlash.The Canadian city has done a deal with a division of Google called Sidewalk Labs. It plans to turn a stretch of land on the waterfront into a smart district: a city ""built from the internet"" is how the promoters describe it.But privacy campaigners are suing the government, claiming that the plan will involve handing over sensitive personal data to a private company.Brenda McPhail from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association explains the group's concerns about giving free rein to a firm in the business of collecting vast amounts of data.""Online, we increasingly understand that comprehensive data collection that permits very granular monitoring of people's activities and behaviours is harming individuals and groups,"" she says.""We question why on Earth we think it's a good idea to import that big data model into our city streets.""The organisation behind the Waterfront Toronto scheme says that it has not yet received a plan from Sidewalk Labs, but once it does it will ensure that the public has a fair opportunity to provide meaningful input on the proposals.The technology industry often assumes that developments such as smart cities are uncontroversial and that everyone will welcome something that could improve urban life.But the public has grown sceptical about technology over recent years, so we can expect to see further battles like the one underway in Toronto."
technology	Tech Tent: What price a folding phone?	Folding money	"Finally something new! After years of every new mobile phone looking identical, we are being offered something radically innovative, a folding device.On this week's Tech Tent, we ask whether folding phones are the next big thing - or just a niche product for early adopters with money to burn.Samsung's Galaxy S10 Fold was the star of its big launch event held in San Francisco on Wednesday.A couple of days before I'd been given a sneak preview of the other phones to be unveiled in the flagship Galaxy S range, handsets which will sell in far greater numbers than the folding version.The new Galaxy S10 - the latest model of what has been a phenomenally successful device for the world's leading manufacturer - is pretty impressive.With its huge screen curving round the edge of the device, a camera with three lenses including a wide angle option and all sorts of AI to optimise its performance, it is probably the best smartphone you can buy right now.But it is, like all of its rivals, another rectangular slab of black glass. And if you tried to explain to someone who was not an avid consumer of smartphone spec sheets what was so different and new about it, you would struggle.That is why there is so much excitement over the Galaxy Fold. It isn't the first folding screen - China's Royole showed one off at CES in Las Vegas last month - and more will follow at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week.But Samsung rivals Apple as a thought-leader in the mobile industry and so when it takes to the stage and says, ""This is what the future looks like"", the world sits up and takes notice.The demo of the smartphone that unfolds to become a tablet was punctuated by applause, and the way the content switched seamlessly between the screens looked impressive - even if nobody outside Samsung has been allowed to get their hands on the device.But then came the announcement of the price - a startling $1,980 (£1,515) - and the audience exhaled as if to say, ""Really?""Since then, the reaction to the Galaxy Fold's luxury price tag has been divided. Some have defended it, pointing out that you get essentially two high end smartphones for your money, and are getting in early to a revolutionary product.Here's gadget blogger Holly Brockwell: ""You really can't be upset about the price of the #GalaxyFold. It's a brand new category, an amazing piece of tech with specs & software to match. Samsung is taking a risk launching the 1st big-brand foldable. Price will come down, but it's worth the money. Just wish I had it.""Our man in San Francisco, Dave Lee, was at the launch and confirms that there was plenty of sucking in of teeth when the price was announced. But he points out that the first HD televisions cost something like $7,500 and he now has one that cost $250.But is a device with a folding screen, even if the price tumbles, really a transformative product that everyone will eventually want, just like the smartphone or the high definition television?I'm not so sure. It seems like product for quite a niche audience of people who are keen on tablets but think it would be easier to carry one around if it folded up and could be put in a pocket.Predicting consumer taste in gadgets is hard. Our special guest Kate Bevan is editor of Which? Computing and brought in the first edition of that magazine from 1999.The cover feature was about compact digital cameras, which cost as much as £800. They took off, the price tumbled but they were eventually rendered almost obsolete by mobile phones.There was also a letter from a reader asking whether he could use the internet when out and about by combining his laptop and mobile phone.The answer was yes, but it was quite a complex business - making the mobile internet easy has been the transformative technology advance of the last twenty years.I somehow doubt many people are writing to tech websites today asking whether they can find a phone that folds up. But maybe 20 years from now we will be looking back on 2019 as the year when the era of dull old rectangular slabs of black glass came to an end."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook weathers the storm	Regulation call	"It seems every couple of days brings another scandal for Facebook - yet its profits continue to soar.On this week's Tech Tent we ask what it will take to dent the enthusiasm of both users and advertisers for the social media giant.On Wednesday morning, many people woke up to news of another privacy scandal. It was revealed that Facebook had targeted teenagers with a market research app which saw them hand over lots of personal information in exchange for a monthly fee.Apple accused Facebook of dodgy dealings with the app, which was distributed to consumers via a platform designed to allow organisations to share private apps with employees. Facebook's use of this system was curtailed - cue anguish from employees unable to see the lunch menu or the bus timetable.Meanwhile, a more serious crisis for the company's reputation was unfolding. Instagram, owned by Facebook, stood accused of failing to protect young people from disturbing content about suicide.The case of Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 at the age of 14, appeared to highlight the dangers of an unregulated social media industry. Molly's father told the BBC he believed Instagram ""helped kill my daughter"".But then on Wednesday evening Facebook came out with record results - profits up nearly 40%, with 2.7 billion people using its products every month. So why is Facebook's business not suffering from the scandals?Research analyst Ryan Doherty, from IHS Markit, tells us that Instagram's rapid growth is one reason advertisers still love the company: ""Instagram Stories hit the 500 million user mark for daily active users,"" he explains. ""That provides an incredible platform for advertisers in the US and in Europe that's pretty well unmatched in terms of daily reach.""Scandals at both Facebook and Google have led advertisers to question whether they are safe places to promote brands. But Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, agrees that in the end their sheer scale is persuasive: ""The Google and Facebook platforms are so much cheaper and more efficient in terms of how they profile and how they reach people. The location data that the services have is really unparalleled.""She says there is a lot of talk from advertisers about wanting a ""cleaner information environment"" but they haven't voted with their wallets yet.That of course might change if the users do begin to get fed up with the product.Jamie Bartlett, social media researcher and author of The People versus Tech, says there are plenty of anecdotes about people leaving Facebook but the numbers tell a different story""I think, in the end, despite the frustration that some users have, the convenience of the platform - that sort of social desire to connect with other people and see what other people are doing - means you might switch off for a while, but generally people end up getting sucked back in.""Perhaps a more imminent danger is regulation. This week saw British MPs call for a new code of practice for social media, with firms like Facebook having a legal duty of care to make sure users under 18 do not come to harm.The world has fallen out of love with Facebook over the last couple of years. So far that has not affected its bottom line but if a combination of regulators, concerned parents and advertisers unite to demand reform, that could change."
technology	Apple removes vaping apps from app store	Harmful agent	"Apple is removing all vaping apps from its online store.It said it had taken the decision because of growing official concerns about the impact vaping can have on health.In the US, 42 deaths and more than 2,100 cases of lung injury have been linked to a respiratory illness tied to vaping.Apple's decision means a total of 181 apps will not be available on iPhones, reports tech news site Axios.In a statement given to Axios, Apple said it agreed with official warnings about the negative health impacts of vaping and the potential problem presented by the appeal of e-cigarettes to the young.It said it took ""great care"" to ensure that the app store was a place people could trust to get programs for their iPhone.The vaping apps available via Apple's store let people exercise control of some features of e-cigarettes and others simply kept people up to date with news about vaping or offered themed games.Apple said anyone who already had a vaping app on their iPhone would be able to continue using it and transfer it to any new Apple device.The move to eliminate vaping apps began in June when Apple decided to stop accepting any new apps related to e-cigarettes.Research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into the causes of the respiratory disease that caused the deaths suggests one ingredient is to blame.The CDC said it had found vitamin E acetate - a thickening agent used in many illegal vaping products - in lung samples from 29 patients hit by the disease."
technology	Zuckerberg plans public tech discussions	New year, new trouble	"Mark Zuckerberg is to hold a series of public discussions on the subject of technology and its future in society.The Facebook boss plans to tackle issues such as artificial intelligence (AI) and jobs, free speech on the net and the growth of online communities.He said he would talk to ""leaders, experts, and people in our community"".Every year Mr Zuckerberg sets himself challenges, which in the past have included running 365 miles, visiting every US state and learning Mandarin.He admitted that he would find the discussions - his challenge for 2019 - taxing.""I'm an engineer and I used to just build out my ideas and hope they'd mostly speak for themselves,"" he wrote on his Facebook page, where he announced the news.""But given the importance of what we do, that doesn't cut it anymore.""So, I'm going to put myself out there more than I've been comfortable with and engage more in some of these debates about the future, the tradeoffs we face and where we want to go.""He said the discussions would be viewable either on Facebook or Instagram or ""other media"".Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn something new. I've built an AI for my home, run 365 miles, visited...End of Facebook post by MarkWhile some replies to his post were supportive, others suggested Mr Zuckerberg should focus on issues closer to home, namely the way in which Facebook shared user data.Technology journalist Casey Newton questioned whether ""a talk show"" was the right approach for the chief executive.""I'm all for open discussions of the most pressing issues facing business and government - and I hope Zuckerberg chooses to sit down with some of Facebook's more thoughtful critics for a lively debate,"" he wrote on technology news website The Verge.""And yet I can't help but wonder, given all his other responsibilities, why Zuckerberg sees a series of live broadcasts as a particularly good use of his time.""In other Facebook news, the social network giant has been accused of breaking a new cyber-security law in Vietnam by allowing anti-government posts. The law came into effect on 1 January 2019.The Vietnam News Agency said Facebook had not responded to requests for it to remove ""fan pages provoking activities against the state"".Facebook said it worked with local authorities.""We have a clear process for governments to report illegal content to us and we review all these requests against our terms of service and local law,"" said a spokeswoman."
technology	Tech Tent: The power of influencers	Brand awareness	"Would you buy a pair of shoes because someone on Instagram said they were great? Or choose a new phone based on the recommendation of a top YouTuber?If so, you are proof of the effectiveness of influencer marketing. On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we explore the phenomenon.Influencers - social media stars with big followings - have been under the spotlight this week for two reasons.First, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority revealed that 16 influencers had promised to be far more transparent when paid to promote a product.The regulator has taken a dim view of celebrities posting images of themselves with an ""awesome"" product, without mentioning that the ""fabulous"" company behind it has paid them a tidy sum to be quite so enthusiastic.They will now be encouraged to use hashtags such as #ad, #sponsored or #freebie to give their fans a clearer picture of what's going on, otherwise they could land up in court.But this week also saw the release of two documentaries about the disastrous Fyre Festival, which appeared to be the apotheosis of influencer marketing. It showed the power of the influencers. Kendall Jenner was reportedly paid $250,000 (£190,000) for one Instagram post promoting tickets that rapidly sold out.It raised questions about the ethics of this form of marketing. The supermodels and other celebrities were happy enough to take money from the Fyre Festival organisers. But when the whole event turned into a fiasco, they faced no consequences for taking part in a very dishonest marketing campaign.""We can see how precarious that is in terms of the legitimacy of those campaigns,"" says Dr Mariann Hardey, associate professor in marketing at Durham University.She is a sceptic about influencer marketing and tells us it is really just another form of that age-old advertising technique, the celebrity endorsement.""I don't think this is the holy grail. Influencers simply amplify traditional marketing methods and strategies,"" she says.But Werner Geyser, founder of the Influencer Marketing Hub, which helps connect influencers with brands, disagrees and tells us he has numbers to back up his argument.""Recently we conducted a survey and we analysed 2,000 campaigns from influencers. And what the research displayed was that there was an average earned media value of $5.20 per dollar spent,"" he says.That earned media value turns out to include something as nebulous as ""increasing brand awareness"", but Mr Geyser insists companies do see real returns in the form of extra sales.He says we should not underestimate the power of these influencers or the bond between them and their followers.""These audiences are following them for a reason. They share common interests so they almost act as a media outlet themselves. They have massive, massive reach.""The question is how they use that influence. Too many Fyre Festivals and they may tarnish their own brands, making them less attractive to advertisers.But even if the current social media stars fade, more will come along and brands will be eager to use them to connect to young people who live their media lives on YouTube and Instagram."
technology	Tech Tent: Tim Cook's bombshell	Also on this week's podcast	"It is a company that is always tight-lipped about its finances between its quarterly results, so Wednesday's letter from Tim Cook warning Apple investors that the outlook had suddenly darkened was a bombshell which rocked the market.On this week's Tech Tent we explore whether Apple's chief executive was right to blame a slowdown in the Chinese economy for its problems or whether there are wider issues with the iPhone, the product which turned it into a trillion dollar company.In the view of Shanghai-based Shaun Rein, Tim Cook is right to blame China. The founder of the China Market Research Group tells us he is very worried about the state of the Chinese economy: ""It's the absolute worst I've seen in the 20 years I've been in China. Everything has really stalled in the last quarter.""And he says that fall in consumer confidence, coupled with the growing trade war with the United States, has made people more nationalistic about the phones they buy.""There's a lot of pride in buying Chinese products made by Chinese for Chinese. After the United States got Canada to arrest the CFO of Huawei that caused a lot of Chinese to be angry. And so a lot of Chinese consumers in a show of patriotism are saying let's not buy Apple let's buy Huawei and show support for the Chinese state.""Even if those trade tensions ease, it is hard to see Chinese phone buyers turning back to Apple in large numbers now the spell has been broken.Last summer Huawei overtook Apple to claim second place behind Samsung in global smartphone sales, With its latest iPhone launches in the autumn, the American giant was expected to climb back above its Chinese rival, but that now looks less likely.Part of the reason is an issue that is damaging Apple not just in China but around the world - the price of an iPhone. The latest model the XS breaches the $1,000 (£768) mark - even the supposedly budget version the XR costs substantially more than a top-of-the-range Huawei phone.Last August, Apple's ability to defy gravity and achieve an ever higher average selling price for its phones was one of the factors that drove its share price higher, pushing it to that trillion dollar valuation.But suddenly there are signs of a consumer revolt. Our man in Silicon Valley Dave Lee tells us of an unusual sight at an Apple Store in the US - a discount offer on the iPhone XR.On Black Friday in the UK a couple of retailers were offering such good deals on the same phone that it was hard to believe that Apple - usually the hardest of hardball negotiators - had not offered them a wholesale discount.Let's not exaggerate Apple's problem - Tim Cook's letter said it was still on track to make record profits and the iPhone still accounts for the vast majority of the profits of the whole phone industry.But the idea was that as iPhone profits eased back they would be replaced by revenues from services - Apple Music, cloud storage and so on. That process may now have to be accelerated."
technology	Tech Tent: Will Apple ban that Saudi app?	Pressure on the governmentAlso on this week's podcast:	"Smartphone apps have transformed many areas of our lives, but in Saudi Arabia they are being used to curtail the rights of women.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether it is the responsibility of technology companies to make sure their platforms are not used by governments to repress their citizens.In Saudi Arabia, women need permission from a male guardian - usually a father or husband - to travel abroad.A smartphone app called Absher, available for Apple or Android phones, gives access to a number of government services. It also allows men to approve or refuse permission for overseas journeys made by women.Recent stories of women who have managed to leave the country against the wishes of their male relatives have highlighted the role technology plays in policing their movements.Rothna Begum, senior women's rights researcher at the campaign group Human Rights Watch, explains how the system affects every Saudi woman when she travels.""She can't leave an airport without permission being provided. The authorities will know whether or not she has been granted permission. If her guardian has asked for notifications, when she's left the airport, he will receive an SMS text alert,"" she explains.Salwa, a young woman who fled Saudi Arabia last year, told the BBC she managed to get out after getting hold of her father's phone.She took it when he was asleep, and clicked on the ""forgot password"" link to steal his identity.""I changed the number of my father's phone to my phone number, and I made a consent for me and for my sister,"" she says.According to Rothna, app store providers should be showing that apps are not facilitating abuse and discrimination. She has called on Apple and Google to act.""Now that they've been alerted to it, they could go back to the Saudi government and tell them to remove the functionality that is allowing men to control and track women.""Removing the app would not mean the end of the male guardianship system. The Saudi government's web portal has the same functions allowing the tracking of women.But Human Rights Watch believes action from the tech companies would increase the pressure on the government to get rid of the system.Apple and Google could well argue that it is not their job to determine the laws of the countries where they operate. But, as with their dealings with China, they will also be aware of the reputational risk of putting commercial interests ahead of the values they claim to espouse.Apple says it is looking into the Absher app. The BBC has contacted Google about this issue but has yet to receive a reply."
technology	Tech Tent: 5G, Huawei and a question of trust		"It was the star turn of Mobile World Congress with a folding phone that was 5G ready. But on this week's Tech Tent we ask should the mobile industry trust Huawei?When I first attended the giant Barcelona mobile gathering more than a decade ago, it was the likes of Nokia, Samsung and even Microsoft, with its Windows phones, which made the headlines.Huawei was an obscure Chinese telecoms equipment maker that occupied a large shed on the showground but struggled to generate much interest from the media.This year the company's press conference on Sunday was the hottest ticket, with swarms of journalists queuing up for an hour to get in.At the heart of the loud and slightly clunky presentation was the Huawei Mate X, a phone with a foldable screen that the presenter suggested was bigger and better in every way than the Samsung Galaxy Fold, unveiled a few days earlier.Despite the fact that at $2,600 (£1,960) it was also even more expensive, most analysts agreed that it trumped the Samsung device. I even managed to get my hands on it the following day though the Huawei executive who produced it out of an inside jacket pocket seemed terrified that I might fold it too far and break it.But if Huawei was rather more open about its new device than Samsung, there was one issue that was firmly off the agenda, The company did not want to talk about the allegations from the United States that it poses a security threat to the new 5G networks.US government officials were in Barcelona to press home their message that Huawei owes its allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party and should not be trusted by the mobile operators to provide secure equipment for their new networks.The Europeans were keen to be seen as sharing some of those concerns. Security consultant David Rogers tells Tech Tent the operators do realise that they may have become over-reliant on cheap Huawei equipment: ""The mobile networks have paid bottom dollar in a lot of cases for certain network equipment and that equipment might not be the same quality as other providers and now they're reaping what they've sown.""But the operators also appear to share Huawei's view that the United States has failed to provide evidence of any wrongdoing in the form of backdoors in its equipment.The consensus is that all providers, whether from China or elsewhere, need to be subjected to greater scrutiny as 5G networks are rolled out and become embedded in vital infrastructure.With 5G demos everywhere across the vast halls of Mobile World Congress, it was apparent how central this technology is to this industry's ambitions and how important security will be.We saw how in Toronto 5G sensors have been installed across the water system to identify water pressure and improve efficiency by spotting any leaks. A team from the UK's University of Surrey showed off a 5G-enabled McLaren sports car which could receive live information about other cars and hazards from sensors mounted by the roads.In both cases, you would want to be certain that the networks and the devices connected to them could not be hacked.Along with all these security concerns, the operators and manufacturers face another nagging question - can they actually make money from 5G? As we emerged from the event where the Chinese firm Xiaomi had unveiled a 5G handset for $679, I ran into the leading mobile analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight.He described that price as ""eye-popping"" - and he meant low not high. With the Chinese firm offering a state-of-the-art 5G handset at a price way below Samsung and Apple's 4G flagships, Ben reckons middle market manufacturers like Sony and LG will struggle to make any kind of margin.5G looks certain to bring another wave of disruption to the mobile industry. And whatever the issues of trust and security, Chinese firms like Xiaomi and Huawei look likely to prosper."
technology	Amazon gets closer to getting Alexa everywhere	Gender choiceTesting trustNew etiquette?	"Rohit Prasad has 17 smart speakers in his home powered by Amazon's smart assistant.""I test my own technology - with all of them being called Alexa, I see which one is waking up and whether it is the right device,"" says the chief scientist of the AI division responsible for the tech.That's a lot of Alexa. But, it seems, still not enough.In a one-on-one interview with the BBC, Mr Prasad discussed plans for Alexa to both become smarter and to follow users wherever they go. This is known in the trade as ubiquitous ambient computing, and Amazon hopes to corner the market.In the US, it already sells an Echo system that plays Alexa through a car's speakers. And Mr Prasad says he also wants the virtual assistant to accompany users as they walk about too.To achieve this, he explains, the tech needs to get better at contextual reasoning.""If you are in a store and you say, 'Where are the tomatoes?' it will need to have the context,"" he says.""You are actually looking for the aisle so it may need a store map.""Or if you are in a hotel room and you ask for the swimming pool hours, it should give you the hours for the hotel and not the community pool.""To pursue this goal, the firm recently launched its own Alexa-enabled earbuds and is testing other wearables including glasses and even a ring with select customers.The more users Alexa attracts and the more time they spend chatting to it, the more data Mr Prasad's team and the training algorithms involved can draw on to make improvements.There are, he says ""hundreds of millions"" of devices worldwide already taking billions of requests each week from customers. He adds that Alexa now offers 100,000-plus skills - its version of apps - and can communicate with other smart products from more than 9,500 brands.And it seems Amazon is getting the upper hand.According to market research firm Canalys, Amazon's smart speakers outsold Google's by nearly three-to-one worldwide in the last quarter. Moreover, it said Amazon's sales were still accelerating while Google's had slumped.Google, of course, benefits from the fact that its assistant is baked into Android, meaning handset owners are already using it across their daily lives.But in the contest to offer the smartest smart assistant, Mr Prasad says Alexa is evolving at a rapid pace.""All of these components have become smarter by four times in terms of what our error rate was in 2014 to now,"" he says.The figure, he says, is based on accurate handling of four common tasks:Amazon is about to let users buy alternative celebrity voices for Alexa, starting with that of the actor Samuel L Jackson.But will it ever give users the choice of having a default voice that isn't female? In other words, letting owners chat to Alex rather than Alexa?Gender-neutral AI is, Mr Prasad says, a ""very hot topic"".""This is a debate we have every few months. It is not just about gender, but about Alexa's voice and choice of words,"" he adds.""We wanted a personality that was very relatable to our customers.""""If we felt that there has to be another gender for Alexa, well we'd also have to think what would the wake word be, because its personality and gender all sort of go together and you have to think about overall personality, not just gender.""Despite all the work that's been done on Alexa, tales of ""fails"" persist.Amazon had to act to curb a spontaneous creepy laugh reported by users last year, while reports persist of it struggling with some accents.According to Martin Garner, an analyst at research firm CCS Insight, Alexa's capabilities may have ""moved on a lot over the last two years... but smart assistant voice services have the effect of raising people's expectations very rapidly too"".""All providers are racing as fast as possible to extend the range of questions they can answer,"" he added.Users also need to feel they can trust Amazon if they are to surround themselves with its microphones. And that confidence was recently challenged after revelations that the firm was using third-party contractors working from home to listen back and label recordings.Amazon has since made it easier to opt out of the process, but Mr Prasad says it has no plans to drop human-based checks.""Supervised learning is a key aspect, where humans label a very small fraction - actually less than 1% - of the data that goes though Alexa,"" he said.""We are making it much easier to delete but also by bringing the convenience of voice. You can say, 'Alexa tell me what you heard,' and if you're uncomfortable with what is was, you can delete it.""But some have questioned this ""easy option"", pointing out that in order to exclude themselves users have to locate a setting buried several menus deep on the Alexa app and Amazon's website.Even if many consumers make an active choice to have Alexa in their lives, others may be unhappy at having their voices picked up.Last month, Google's devices chief Rick Osterloh told the BBC that he informs guests to his home that smart speakers are in use before they enter.But Mr Prasad says he does not believe there's a need for such etiquette to become widespread.""It's very important to realise that the devices don't listen for anything but Alexa, the wake word,"" he says.""We have to be clear about that in terms of what detection means.""You can mute the button on the device. And Alexa is quite transparent when it is streaming to the cloud because the blue lights come on.""Even so, as Alexa is added to more devices and becomes more omnipresent there's a question about how obvious this will always be."
technology	Facebook reveals preparations for UK election	'Transparent and trackable'Full Fact	"Facebook has set out extra measures for fighting the spread of disinformation at the next UK election.These include extending its partnership with fact checker Full Fact and improving the ad library in which political ads are archived.In addition, it announced separate plans for the 2020 US Presidential vote, including a way to track how much each candidate spends on Facebook ads.It also confirmed it continues to be a target for foreign influence campaigns.The company's cyber-security chief said his team had just removed four distinct networks of accounts, pages and groups from Facebook and Instagram earlier in the day.""Three of them originated in Iran, and one in Russia - they targeted a number of different regions including the United States, North Africa and Latin America,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher.""The Russian operation showed some links to the [St Petersburg-based] Internet Research Agency and had the hallmarks of a well resourced operation.""They took consistent operational security steps to conceal their identity and location, and it appears that this operation was still in the early stages, and was focused on trying to build its audience when we took it down.""Richard Allan, Facebook's vice president of policy solutions, detailed its plans for an expected UK election in an article for the Daily Telegraph.He said it would also set up ""a dedicated operations centre"" for the UK if an election is declared.The centre's job would be to quickly remove content which breaks Facebook rules, saidHowever, he reiterated that it would not be Facebook's job to ""fact check or judge the veracity of what politicians say"".All political ads, including ads in the UK on social issues such as immigration, health and the environment, will be subject to verification of the identification of the poster, and stored in the firm's political archive, searchable by anyone, whether or not they are a member of Facebook.The library, designed to make political ads more transparent and trackable, has faced criticism for being difficult to use because of bugs and crashes.In July 2019 the New York Times covered the case of a researcher from Mozilla who reported a bug which crashed the library after 59 pages of results.Facebook replied that the issue was ""unfortunately a won't fix for now"" although it later said it had resolved the problemMr Allan also pledged to offer all political candidates a dedicated channel for reporting harassment.Full Fact was co-founded by Conservative party donor Michael Samuel in 2010, and it operates as a charity.In September it identified that a Conservative party advert had featured a BBC article with an altered headline.Facebook later removed the ad. Full Fact said that various versions of the headline would have received up to 510,000 impressions, although that could have included multiple viewings by one person.""Images and videos on Facebook which [Fact Check] assess to be untrue will now be more clearly labelled as false, and we'll continue pointing people to reports which debunk the myth,"" said Mr Allan.""Our algorithm also heavily demotes this content so it's seen by fewer people and far less likely to go viral.""Mr Allan stopped short of saying that the extra measures would be sufficient to prevent election interference in the next UK election.""While we can never say for sure that there won't be issues in future elections, we are confident that we're better prepared than ever,"" he said."
technology	Why is the MWC tech show full of men?		As I walked into the chaotic registration zone at the hall hosting Xiaomi’s press conference, my first event of the 2019 Mobile World Congress (MWC), I soon became aware that I looked… different.I was dressed reasonably smartly and was even dutifully wearing my delegate's lanyard just like everybody else, even though I hate it – it is too long and I had to tie a knot in it when I realised people were not admiring my belt but trying to read my name.But, in the sea of people milling around awkwardly, waiting to collect a pass giving them access to the event, my colleague Tracey and I were two of very few women.It was a woman who gave me my pass. It was also a woman who was pouring out glasses of wine for the reception afterwards. But there were no women speaking inside the hall during the presentation.We left in a hurry to go to another event across town, hosted by Huawei, the brand everybody is talking about both here in Barcelona and around the world.Once there, I looked at the long queue snaking round outside the beautiful Italian Pavilion in the heart of Barcelona. I was once again in the minority. Inside, there were no women on stage there either.I shared a taxi to the next event with analyst Carolina Milanesi, who travels the world attending technology industry events such as MWC. It was the same every year, she told me as we chatted.“At CES [the Las Vegas technology fair], the thing was booth babes and skimpily dressed people – that’s not the case here but women are in the position of being the hostess, they are smart and look nice but they are serving,” she told me.“You are either sexually objectified or you are the housewife but you are not seen as making a decision about tech or buying it.”At my final event of the day, hosted by Microsoft, the organisers had clearly tried to even out the presenters, alternating men and women – although after the first four speakers, there was a succession of men before the next woman joined the stage.On day one of the exhibition itself, I spent an hour in the priority queue to try out Microsoft’s HoloLens2. Not only was I the only woman in that line, there were only a handful in the enormous, general queue, which, I heard, was four hours long. The security guard at the front was a woman.Around the conference halls, I found myself constantly jostled by crowds of men swarming around concept cars, robots and 5G smartphones. Meanwhile, the press officers who were constantly pinging me on email, asking me to meet their exhibiting clients were more likely to be women than men.Claire, not her real name, is attending MWC for the first time, working for one of the major global brands.“I have to say I am surprised by how few women there are at the event - barring of course hospitality and venue staff,” she told me“I thought that this should be different [to other industry events] - it's much more consumer focused - but a common theme among the women I've met here is the fact that the halls are a sea of testosterone.”She thinks some technology companies need to rethink their priorities.“The industry talks a good game about being relevant to women - but it's hard to believe that for some companies it's anything more than lip service when you look around the hall,” she said.One company under scrutiny for many reasons already is Huawei, which has a huge presence here.In one hall, it occupies a vast space, easily the size of a supermarket. And every single delegate's lanyard bears the Huawei logo.We arrived before its stand opened but waiting to greet people when it did were women dressed in national costumes from around the world.Thankfully, there were no bikinis but still I couldn’t quite decide whether this was a beautiful display of global inclusivity or a cringeworthy homage to Miss World.The million dollar question here of course is – why aren’t there more women here? It’s not like female attendees are screened out. If you’ve got the 450 euros, and/or press or analyst credentials, you can come.A spokesman for the Global System for Mobile Communications trade body, which organises MWC, told me that in 2018 24% of the delegates had been women, a 1% increase on 2017. Over 100,000 people attend.He also told me about the Women4Tech programme, which runs a number of events aimed at women working in and around the industry during the four days of MWC.I love tech. I have spent years covering the subject as a journalist and I don’t feel my gender prevents me from doing so. It’s very rare that I feel actively unwelcome at an event – I don’t here either - and the days when people used to ask me who was looking after my children while I was working seem, fortunately, to be behind me.It’s more subtle than that - and not necessarily a conscious bias. Perhaps it’s a vicious cycle - women like me come along, feel a bit like we should be serving the drinks and then decide not to return. We have to shout louder, jostle harder, raise our arms higher to get those photos.The men I have spoken to about it seem a bit embarrassed. The women seem resigned.An industry friend of mine told me it was one reason why she chose to avoid these events.Don’t forget, though, women are equally expected to consume all of this technology. And if we disappear, our voices will not be heard when it comes to their design.Here’s an example of what I mean.At a networking event one evening, I chatted to the owner of a mobile phone company over a glass of wine. We were discussing the new trend for folding phones. And I said I would prefer one that folded out to be the size my existing phone is now.He asked me why on Earth that was the case, so I showed him how awkwardly it fits into the pockets of my jeans. And he was absolutely astonished.His fitted just fine, he said - he’d never even thought about it.
technology	Tech Tent: Is the internet bad for us?		"From encouraging suicide to giving young people an unhealthy addiction to staring at smartphones, digital technology has been accused in recent days of doing more harm than good.On Tech Tent we explore the impact of the internet on our mental health - and meet two people with different solutions for dealing with stress.In the UK this week the harmful effects of social media have been highlighted by the case of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017.Her father believes the graphic images of self-harm she saw on Instagram and other social media sites helped kill his daughter.After mounting pressure to act, Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - now says it will remove graphic self-harm images. Its boss Adam Mosseri said some material in which people related their experiences of recovery would remain but would be harder to find.The other debate has been about the harmful effects of spending too long staring at smartphones and other devices. There was government advice on the issue of screen time this week from the UK's four chief medical officers, including England's Sally Davies.She admitted there was little academic research on whether excessive time looking at screens was harmful but had a few simple rules. Children should not spend more than two hours at a time on screens and should not be allowed to take phones to bed. As for adults, they should set a good example by putting their phones away at mealtimes.But Cal Newport thinks we all need to rethink our relationship with our devices. His new book Digital Minimalism is all about making technology work for you and not the other way round.His first tip is to clean up your smartphone: ""Take off your phone any app where someone makes money when you click on it. What you have then lost is the ability for these companies to try to snag your time and attention at every piece of downtime, at every piece of potential solitude.""When I suggest this is too radical a step and involves wiping out most internet activity he reassures me that it is fine to use these apps on a desktop computer - it is our addiction to smartphones that is the problem. He says we've become like emergency services dispatchers, constantly taking in information and posting our thoughts.""It's this constant companion model of smartphone use which is really quite new and benefits the corporate bottom line more than it benefits anyone's actual technological lives,"" he says.Michael Acton Smith has a solution to dealing with the stress of modern life - a smartphone app. This week his mindfulness business Calm achieved unicorn status - a valuation of a billion dollars - with investors convinced that paying for meditation and insomnia tips is the next big thing.He accepts there is an irony in using smartphones to improve mental health but says the technology isn't the problem: ""They are tools, very, very powerful tools and we can use them in positive ways or negative ways. What mindfulness does is make us a little more aware, a little more conscious of how we use these devices.""He believes the benefits of smartphones outweigh their negative aspects. Cal Newport, who has decided he can manage his life as a computer science academic and author without having any social media accounts, is more cautious.Mr Newport does have an old iPhone but says he spends large parts of his day away from it: ""If there's something I really care about that tech can help with I'll deploy it. But I'm not going to let the technology change what the actual rhythm of my life is.""As someone whose daily rhythm now involves checking social media on his phone on waking and last thing at night, that is a message I need to take on board. But bringing digital minimalism into my life is going to be quite a challenge."
technology	Tech Tent: Missing Mark Zuckerberg	Easy access	"For three hours this week Richard Allan was in one of the world's most uncomfortable seats.In a Westminster committee room, parliamentarians from nine countries battered Facebook's European policy chief, mostly over one issue: why was he there instead of Mark Zuckerberg?On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we ask whether - beyond the theatre - we learned anything new from the inquisition of Richard Allan.He was on the back foot as the politicians accused his company of everything from playing fast and loose with user data, to aiding repression in Myanmar and threatening democracy around the world.The best zinger came from a Canadian MP who said: ""Our democratic institutions have been upended by fratboy billionaires from California, and Mr Zuckerberg's decision not to appear speaks volumes"".But what everyone was waiting to find out about was those internal Facebook documents seized from a businessman who is in a legal dispute with the social media giant.In the event, the committee chairman Damian Collins opted not to publish the documents immediately.But he did pluck one email from the pile. It was from a Facebook engineer in 2014 apparently sounding the alarm about a high level of Russian activity, with three billion data points a day being accessed from Russian IP addresses.Richard Allan did not really have an answer when asked what action had been taken about this warning. Later, Facebook published the whole email chain which appeared to show that the engineers who had raised the issue subsequently concluded that there was not actually clear evidence of Russian activity.So Facebook emerged from that clash relatively unscathed. But late in the day came evidence from another witness who suggested that on wider issues about access to user data, Richard Allan had been less than frank with the committee.Ashkan Soltani, a former technology advisor to the US Federal Trade Commission said that version one of the Facebook platform - before it was changed in 2014 - did allow developers unfiltered access to users' data, contradicting the evidence given earlier.He also said that, in the 2011 settlement of its privacy case against Facebook, the FTC alleged that if a user had an app installed it had access to nearly all the users' profile information, even if set to private.The following day Damian Collins was very critical of the performance of Richard Allan, telling a conference: ""I don't think he was straight with the committee. Was it disingenuous? Yes. Was it misleading? Yes. Did he probably hold back relevant and important information? Almost certainly yes.""Facebook disputes that - and disagrees with the version of events laid out by Mr Soltani. The social media giant is also aggrieved at what it sees as the selective and biased use of documents obtained from a litigant, the app developer Six4Three, determined to paint it in the worst possible light.This is a battle that is only going to get more bitter. In the coming days, Damian Collins plans to release a redacted version of the documents which may shed light on internal discussions at Facebook about how far to go in allowing developers access to users' data.Prepare for more fireworks…."
technology	Government shutdown 'embarrassing' to US tech industry		"The ongoing US government shutdown is an embarrassment to the country’s technology industry, a leading figure has said.Several government officials had to pull out of attending the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), a trade event which begins this week, because of the current political stalemate.""I don't imagine a lot of people who are making these decisions in Washington are even aware of the ramifications,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which produces the show.Mr Shapiro said he hoped stock market turbulence would put pressure on the US and China to reach an agreement on trade tariffs soon.However, he added: ""I'm not totally convinced that President Trump wants an agreement with the Chinese.”More from CES 2019:The White House has not yet responded to a request for comment.The CTA advocates for more than 2,000 technology firms, and counts Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Sony and many others among its membership.CES is the largest trade show of its kind in the world. Scheduled to attend were a number of high ranking government figures, including Ajit Pai, the head of the US telecoms regulator. At least 10 officials had to withdraw, citing the government shutdown which has been in place since 22 December.""As an American I am not thrilled that my own government can't get its act together,” Mr Shapiro told the BBC.“It’s embarrassing to be on the world stage with a dominant event in the world of technology, and our federal government - who had planned to send quite a significant delegation of top-ranking people - can't be there to host their colleague government executives from around the world.”“We like to be proud of our country, and sometimes we struggle.”He said he was optimistic next year’s show would be different, and that current negotiations over trade tariffs would be resolved.Last week, Apple said the struggling Chinese economy meant it had earned significantly less than predicted in the final three months of 2018. The news sent Apple’s stock plummeting - so too other tech firms deemed to be vulnerable.Mr Shapiro said part of the problem may be changing attitudes towards American products.“There's a lot of social media in China which is not embracing the United States, its companies and its products,” he said.Despite the tensions, Mr Shapiro said there was no discernible difference between the number of Chinese companies deciding to exhibit at CES. The country represents around 40% of the firms at the show.Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019________Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Tech Tent: Netflix and the race for eyeballs	Also on the podcast this week:	"It is the company that is changing the way we watch, and it is sending tremors through the TV and film industries.But on this week's Tech Tent podcast, we ask how long Netflix can keep up the extraordinary spending spree that has kept it ahead of its rivals.On Thursday, Netflix released full-year results showing it had more than 139 million subscribers, with nearly 9 million joining in the last three months.After years of keeping viewing figures close to its chest, it revealed that its latest big hit - the suspense movie Birdbox - had been watched by 80 million households in the first four weeks after its release.Vindication then for the bold strategy of spending huge sums on original content. Until 2013, Netflix offered just bought-in films and TV programmes, many of which were available elsewhere. Then came House of Cards, The Crown, Stranger Things and a host of other dramas, documentaries and comedies.These Netflix originals now account for most of what its subscribers view, but that success has come after huge expenditure. Analysts reckon a total of $13bn (£10bn) went on programming last year. In its letter to shareholders, the company said it planned to ""keep significantly growing our content"", which presumably meant spending even more.This is all financed by massive borrowing. The company will have to pay back something like $32bn over the coming years for all that content and other costs.Investors haven't worried about this so far, betting that growing the audience is the key in the short term and that will eventually deliver huge profits. The same strategy is followed by Amazon, Facebook and other tech giants.So the most important number for Netflix is not how many people watch Birdbox but how many new subscribers sign up. This week saw a big price rise in the US, a market which is already nearing saturation. That should improve the financial situation as long as it does not put off new subscribers.So far, the firm has outpaced rivals such as Amazon Prime Video and HBO. But more services are launching, and may try to undercut Netflix. The race for eyeballs is on and the big beneficiaries will be the actors and programme-makers whose talents will be vital in this battle.On @bbctechtent the robot grocery delivery service speeding through the streets of Scottsdale ArizonaA post shared by Rory Cellan-Jones (@rorycellan) on Jan 18, 2019 at 6:17am PSTEnd of Instagram post by rorycellan"
technology	Google given green light for Toronto smart city	Tech's sake	"Sidewalk Labs's plans to create a smart city in a disused area of Toronto can proceed but on a much smaller scale than it had wanted.Any data the Google-affiliate collects there must be treated as a public asset.Waterfront Toronto, the group charged with overseeing development of the area, voted unanimously for it to proceed, after imposing several conditions.The project has proved controversial.Sidewalk Labs had wanted to develop a 190-acre (0.7-sq-km) site but was given permission for just 12 acres. It had also wanted to create its own group to oversee the data collected by sensors around the city, which was also rejected.The project will now move forward to a more formal evaluation and further public consultations. A final vote on whether to approve the project is set for March 2020.Sidewalk Labs said: ""We are encouraged by today's decision by the Waterfront Toronto board and are pleased to have reached alignment on critical issues with Waterfront Toronto.""We are working to demonstrate an inclusive neighbourhood here in Toronto, where we can shorten commute times, make housing more affordable, create new jobs, and set a new standard for a healthier planet.""Stephen Diamond, who chairs the Waterfront Toronto group, said in an open letter: ""Let me be clear, this is not a done deal. There is still much work to do before a final decision.""While a final board decision whether or not to proceed has yet to be made, we are pleased that we are now able to move to the evaluation stage on a project that has the potential to create new jobs and economic development opportunities, create a carbon-neutral neighbourhood and more affordable housing units.""Sidewalk Labs won an initial contract to develop the area in 2017 and promised a radical mix of offices, retail spaces and homes, with high-tech solutions to urban problems such as traffic and waste disposal.But there were questions about how transparent the deal with Waterfront Toronto was.It later emerged its ambitions went beyond the initial 12-acre site, with a much bigger neighbourhood earmarked for development.In return for its investment in the area, it wanted a share of property taxes, development fees and to benefit from the increased value of the land.Sidewalk Labs released its blueprints for developing the site in June and an expert panel appointed by Waterfront Toronto to assess it produced a report criticising some of its proposals, calling them ""tech for tech's sake"".Meanwhile, Block Sidewalk, a citizen opposition group, was set up calling for the project to be dropped entirely. It questioned why a technology company was allowed to be involved in city governance at all and said citizens had not been properly consulted about what they wanted to see developed in the area.Experts remain divided on the plans. In an article in Toronto Life, ahead of the decision, Prof Shoshana Zuboff called the plans ""surveillance capitalism"", while urbanist Richard Florida said the involvement of Sidewalk Labs could see a new generation of start-up companies propel Toronto into the top ranks of global cities."
technology	Tech Tent: The taxi wars	Also on the podcast this week:	"Who is going to decide how we travel around our cities - Californian tech giants or local transport businesses?On Tech Tent we hear from the UK firm helping local taxi operators take the fight to Uber and from an American scooter firm trying to change the law in Britain.I took a trip to Manchester this week and leaving the station, I had a number of options to get to my destination in Cheadle, on the outskirts of the city.I could have grabbed a cab from the station rank or used the ubiquitous Uber - but instead I downloaded an app called Streetcars.This enabled me to order a minicab from the local firm of that name and it deposited me at the headquarters of Autocab - the company that built the app for Streetcars and about 500 other local taxi firms across the UK.Autocab has built the iGo network, which means that you can download the app in Manchester and use it with a local cab firm in Nottingham or Southampton or Bristol, too.The company's chief executive, Safa Alkateb, says it deals with the competitive advantage Uber has had until now over local firms:""Uber can tell you, 'Download my app and you can use it in 20 cities, or wherever you go',"" he explains. ""In the past, these local taxi firms had no way of doing that.""The problem, though, is that Uber is now very well known among the kind of people who use apps, certainly compared with the likes of Manchester's Streetcars, although Alkateb says we should not underestimate the power of local brands.Autocab has been providing various services to cab firms for 20 years and was developing apps back before Uber got off the ground.So I put to the CEO the obvious question: why wasn't this Manchester firm heading for a $120bn (£92bn) IPO and global domination and not the start-up born in San Francisco?Safa Alkateb, who spent a career in Silicon Valley before coming home to run Autocab, had a simple answer - money.""Tens of others had technology just as good as Uber that never went anywhere. The difference is Uber has been heavily financed by Wall Street and they've raised more than $13bn. We didn't have the same access to capital.""He says building Uber's app might have cost something like $30m but the rest of its huge pile of cash has gone on subsidising rides, offering discounts, effectively buying up the market.This week another Californian company with plenty of money behind it arrived in the UK, determined to shake things up.The electric scooter rental firm, Bird, has raised $300m at a reported valuation of $2bn and has launched its service across the United States and in a handful of European cities.UK law does not allow this kind of scooter either on public streets or pavements but Bird has launched a pilot service in London on the private paths of the capital's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.When I say ""pilot service"", it is more of a campaigning tool, designed to get UK regulators and politicians to change the rules. But unlike Uber with its early ""move fast and break things"" approach, which saw it clash with local regulators, Bird wants to play nice.""In Europe, every single city we've launched in we've worked hand-in-glove with government and local councils to make sure we launch with their approval,"" Richard Corbett, Bird's UK and Nordic chief, tells us.As for buying up the market, he denies that this is the plan. ""Gone are the days where you could just throw lots of money at it and flood the market,"" he says.Unlike when Uber arrived on the scene, there is plenty of competition in cities where Bird operates, not just from other American firms, such as Lime, but from local operators.What they all still have to prove is that hopping on a scooter and tussling with other traffic on busy city streets is a prospect that really adds up to a multibillion-dollar market."
technology	CES 2019: America, China and tech's next step	Missing firmsWar on trade'Drumbeat of hostility'Differing philosophy	"In a corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, a row of Huawei Mate 20 smartphones are lined up, sparkling, for CES delegates to try out.It's a typical scene at the trade show but one made slightly surreal by the fact that few Americans will likely ever own these phones. Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance.And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud.And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point.""It makes business sense for them to come here,"" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES.""Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here.""But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event.Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work.While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures, was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show.More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees.It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations.Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry: Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lower when it reports its next quarterly earnings.Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect.Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an ""American"" or ""Chinese"" phone rather absurd.It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place.If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage.""I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,"" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research.""So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset.""More from CES 2019:Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology.This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity.Huawei took ""Made in China"" and made it ""Designed in China"". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple.This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well.Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks.To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide.""Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,"" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy.""Everyone is else is playing catch-up.""The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well.Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive.""From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,"" Mr Purdy argues.He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made.""It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them.""Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products acrossSo will the US ever be fully open to China's business?It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways.When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible.The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty?""The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,"" Mr Shapiro says.""I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition.""Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019"
technology	Tech Tent: Are tech giants held to account?	Big-brand 'adoration''Anti-media'Also on the podcast this week:	"With its vast architectural masterpieces, built at eye-watering cost to house some of the world's largest tech brands, Silicon Valley is certainly doing a good job of making itself look important.But as the biggest firms extend their reach in the public sphere, is sharing our personal data a fair price to pay for the services they deliver?Remember the days when Google was ""just"" a search engine? When Facebook was just a way of catching up with your distant mates? And when Apple was just a fruit - only kidding - a computer?Now these same brands are also involved in healthcare, education, payment systems, community projects and - increasingly - politics.On this week's Tech Tent podcast, author and futurist Lucie Greene tells me she thinks it is about time the tech giants faced a bit more scrutiny.""I think for a long time we were kind of in awe of these businesses who grew so quickly and were such a success story,"" she says.""For a long time these guys have been viewed with a not-really-critical lens, in my view.""You only have to attend a tech product launch (or indeed view the live stream) to see the adoration with which these big brands are viewed by many.And why would the firms invite anyone who doesn't share that enthusiasm?They are likely to be people who will ask more critical questions - the questions that a multi-billion-dollar global firm should arguably have a duty to answer, whether they are about its political ambitions or its treatment of factory workers.Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica data scandal may have shone a light on what goes on behind those shiny campus windows, but despite their public proclamations, Ms Greene believes the tech giants continue to shy away from transparency.""In a lot of ways their attitude to the media is really quite similar to [that of President] Trump,"" she says.""There's been a lot of controversy in the US in the last week about Trump's anti-media stance. But really big tech is much more anti-media and presents more of an existential threat, whether it's Peter Thiel shutting down a media publication he took issue with, essentially, or Google and Facebook becoming the media, replacing the media.""Charlotte Jee, editor of the news site Tech World, agrees.""Tech companies like to give access to who they want to and who will be friendly,"" she says.""They should be held to account but they certainly do try to avoid it."""
technology	Project Nightingale: Google probed over US patient data deal	Websites' data shared	"Google is to be investigated over how it is accessing US patient data via a major health firm, the Wall Street Journal reports.An office of the US Department of Health and Human Services will examine the details of a deal dubbed ""Project Nightingale"".Google said patient data was ""secure"".Separately, in the UK, the Financial Times (FT) reports that popular health websites are sharing sensitive data with firms including Google.The Project Nightingale deal with Ascension - a firm that runs 2,600 hospitals in the US - attracted criticism from some when the Wall Street Journal revealed that Google could access patient data without them being notified.Among those who expressed concern was Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski.""Privacy protections, particularly when it comes to personal info like your health, is a high priority of mine,"" she said via Twitter.However, in a blog, Google argued that the deal ""adheres to industry-wide regulations"" and that access to patient data by its employees was controlled.The tech giant said patient data would not be combined with customer data from other parts of its business.It added that it was ""happy to co-operate"" with the federal inquiry.In its own blog, Ascension said it looked forward to developing artificial intelligence tools for medical purposes with Google's help.News of Project Nightingale coincided with an FT investigation that revealed how popular health websites in the UK frequently shared personal data with companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook.Websites such as WebMD and Bupa used cookies - code added to web browsers - that allowed other companies to track users' activity on the web.The kind of data shared from health websites to others included medical symptoms, diagnoses, and menstrual and fertility information, as well as the names of drugs.Google told the FT it had strict policies preventing advertisers from using sensitive data to target ads."
technology	Donald Trump's wall: How tech guards the US-Mexico border		"""We gotta get outta here!"" cries Agent Daniel Hernandez of US Border Patrol.Moments earlier a hurled rock from over the fence whacked the tin roof next to us with an almighty thud. Its target: Agent Hernandez, my camerawoman and yours truly.""You gotta limit your exposure when you're there by the International Fence, you know,"" says Agent Hernandez, once we're safely back in his truck.I do now.We are in southern Arizona at the Nogales Border Crossing checkpoint.While President Trump demands a wall costing several billions of dollars, and the Democrats suggest technology would be better suited to the job, we are being given a whistle-stop tour of some of the tech already in use within Arizona's Tucson Sector.As we ride around, Agent Hernandez tells me his Southwest Border sector has 262 miles (422km) of border fencing with Mexico, but thousands of miles of patrol area.Recently his team enhanced its surveillance abilities by upgrading their Integrated Fixed Towers, also known as IFTs - almost everything is abbreviated by US government employees.The structures are up to 180ft (55m) tall and are laden with sensors at their top.The update means they are now equipped with longer-range video cameras, better thermal imaging cameras, and radar to provide 24/7 high altitude points of view for officers back at the Nogales Control Center.""Before we'd see some pixellation,"" Agent Hernandez explains.""The cameras, due to their remote placements, were difficult to focus from far away, but now we have really high resolution, crisp images.""He goes on: ""We're able to identify things that come over the fence, people that come over the fence, contraband that comes over the fence, a lot quicker and at greater distances.""Agent Hernandez slows the car to a stop, leaning forward in his seat and peers out into the hills.""I believe there's one person under that tree. He's a human smuggler scout,"" he declares.He points at the man dressed in brown clothing and a hat, sitting a few yards beyond the fence.Agent Hernandez may be hawk-eyed, but come nightfall a scout like this would be tricky to see, even for him. The IFTs though apparently help his team catch camouflaged crossers.""We might not see them, but our thermal cameras allow us to see. Our tech helps us stay one step above the criminal element.""We travel down the winding road to Mariposa Wash, an area where there is a 1m gap between the fence's bottom and the ground.The gap is there to prevent erosion from water, but it means a person could easily duck underneath.""We don't want people thinking this is the only thing keeping America safe,"" comments Agent Hernandez, patting the suspended barrier.""We have fencing as a tool - but this is by no means meant to keep people in or out.""A few minutes up the road and the steel fencing stops, only to be replaced by sticks, cattle wire and Normandy-style barriers.It looks very makeshift, but this style of vehicle fencing stretches out across a large portion of Arizona's border with Mexico.Instead of fencing, border agents have a range of other tools in their arsenal.I am told sensors are buried in the ground around the area, which trigger an alarm if someone or something big enough passes nearby.Mobile Surveillance Trucks are also in use where there is uneven terrain and the towers cannot be built.They are equipped with the same technology as the IFTs, but have thermal rangefinders that enable remote operators to measure the distance between themselves and people crossing.They also have laser pointers to direct agents in the field to hidden targets at night.From the truck's extendable mast, they can shine a beam of light on to a suspect so agents wearing night-vision goggles can physically find them.US Customs and Border Protection has also begun testing drones equipped with infrared and facial recognition cameras to monitor the land from above.Agent Hernandez tells me his team is currently trialling an Android-based location-tracking app, so agents can keep tabs of each others' whereabouts in real-time.In 2017, Agent Hernandez's team arrested 40,000 people attempting to cross illegally into the United States.But of course it's not always criminals that get caught in the net.The recent migrant caravans - in which hundreds of people travel together - have highlighted how many families are willing to undertake a perilous journey in hope of a better life in the States.Many families have been separated at the border, and two children have died since being detained by authorities.For Agent Hernandez, he says he's just doing his job.""No matter what side of the spectrum you fall on, border security is important for the entire country"" he says.""We're law enforcement officers, we don't dictate the laws, we enforce the laws.""The best way to enforce the laws is by doing it in most effective and efficient way, and technology allows us to do that."""
technology	Tech Tent: When gaming stops being fun	Living wage?Also on this week's podcast	"A glamorous industry where highly paid people do exciting and creative work - that is how many see the video games business.But on Tech Tent we hear from people who paint a different picture of zero-hours contracts, unpaid overtime and job insecurity.The games industry now ranks with the movie and music businesses when it comes to making money - and employs people with a range of skills, from software developers to musicians and writers.There is also a lot of fairly routine work which is poorly paid and insecure but provides a first step on the ladder for those eager to get into the industry.Now the IWGB (Independent Workers Union of Great Britain) trade union, which represents some Uber drivers and other gig economy workers in the UK, is opening a games industry branch. It says this is one of the first unions to represent games workers anywhere in the world.One of its first members is a games tester who wants us to call him Chuck - he does not want his employer, a big games developer in London, to know he is involved in the union.His work involves checking that a game works in another language, playing it for hours on end to check for any mistakes. Sounds fun? He has no complaints about the work - it's the pay and insecurity which are his concern.""It is zero-hours contracts, which means the company has the right to fire us at basically any time. And the wage is between £8 and £10 an hour, depending on what language you speak.""That is below the London Living Wage of £10.55 an hour - and with no sick pay Chuck cannot afford to take time off: ""I had a nasty cold a while back and I had to go to work sick for two weeks. And it was just, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, fall into bed and repeat, for two weeks.""One of the union organisers Karn Bianco says firms can get away with poor conditions because there is an endless supply of eager young recruits: ""This is such a dream job for many people. Lots of people want to work there, there's a lot of passion and people are passionate and often are voluntarily working lots of hours.""He tells us about something called ""crunch"" - the long hours expected of workers in the run-up to the release of a game. ""Unpaid and excessive overtime is very common in many studios.""This issue was highlighted recently when the co-founder of Rockstar games Dan Houser talked enthusiastically about the 100-hour weeks being worked to complete the huge hit Red Dead Redemption 2.Mr Houser later clarified that he was only talking about himself and a few senior writers and there had been no expectation that other staff would work such long hours.But Karn Bianco says the story did have an impact; ""The backlash from that publicity caused them to change some of their policies and their working practices just from the attention they got.""We asked Rockstar about the crunch phenomenon in the light of Mr Houser's comments - the company pointed us towards his clarification but had nothing new to say.But the games industry trade body Ukie (The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment) does appear to recognise that there are issues with the working culture. Its chief executive Jo Twist says it is imperative that businesses ""offer working environments that are inclusive and healthy places for employees from all backgrounds"".Right now, many games firms packed with young men who work late into the night fuelled by pizza are neither diverse nor healthy,It is never going to be hard to recruit young people to an industry dedicated to fun - but the pressure to make sure that their working lives aren't miserable is only going to grow."
technology	Tech became 'darker and more muddy' in 2018	Privacy laws	"Data abuse has ""darkened"" technology's potential, the EU's Competition Commissioner has warned.In an interview for the BBC's Today programme, Margrethe Vestager criticised the tech giants for misusing data and failing to respect citizens' rights.New EU rules governing what could be done with data provided some protection, she said.But she added that the need for more concerted action was becoming pressing.""Over these 12 months our relationship with tech has both been darker and more muddy because it becomes increasingly clear that all the bright and shiny positive potentials of tech are at the risk of being darkened by forced misuse of data, manipulation, supervision, no respect of the citizen, no respect of individual rights,"" she told Martha Lane Fox who carried out the interview.""There is an increasing awareness of the fact that we really need to do something and to do that together.""Baroness Lane-Fox, who is a board member of Twitter, is guest editor of this morning's Today radio programme on BBC Radio 4.The past year's scandals have included:The tech firms' actions had changed views about how the industry could influence people and society, said Ms Vestager.The EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in May 2018, gave people new privacy rights and more control over their data, but more work was needed, said Ms Vestager.The civil service was now talking about ways to force tech firms to be more ""transparent"" about what they did with data gleaned from people's uploads, shares and views, she added.But Ms Vestager described herself as being positive about the future.""One thing I do hope over the next 10 years is that we get a much more... transparent way of dealing with data and giving access to data,"" she said.""I tend to be an optimist by choice. I think it's a moral obligation because pessimists don't seem to get anything done.""But failure to act, Ms Vestager cautioned, could lead to situation in which one or two massive firms dominated use of our personal data.Baroness Lane-Fox asked if this meant that the commission would take concrete steps to break up monopolies or tackle markets where dominance stifled competition.Commissioner Vestager responded that while dismantling companies had served Brussels well in the past, the speed at which changes occurred in the tech sector made it a less appropriate response.Instead, she said, the commission might look at how larger firms got access to data and resources in a bid to limit their power.Regarding Brexit, Ms Vestager noted that European competition authorities had become stronger by working together.But she added that the UK had ""clever skilled people with a very strong dedication"" to making sure the market served consumers."

technology	Iran's internet blackout reaches four-day mark		"A country of 80 million people - and practically no way to get online. Iran's internet shutdown has lasted for four days now, sparking international concern.Following protests over a sharp increase in fuel prices in the country, internet connections began to go dark beginning late on Saturday night, local time.On social media, Iranians living or travelling abroad have shared stories of being cut off from their families and friends back home.Many are still waiting for news of their welfare.Alp Toker at internet-monitoring non-profit NetBlocks watched it unfold.""We detected fluctuations in regional connectivity,"" he tells the BBC.""This extended towards having national impact by later in the evening.""Since then, internet traffic in the country has plummeted to 5% of normal levels, according to NetBlocks.NetBlocks tracks connectivity in countries around the world by scanning the internet for communications devices - routers, servers, mobile phone towers - and keeping a database of those known to be online in each territory.By periodically sending brief messages over the internet to these devices, a practice called ""pinging"", NetBlocks and similar organisations can see when they go offline.Mr Toker says he is taken aback by the extent of the blackout in Iran: ""This is on a different scale to other instances we've seen around the world.""He points out that the internet system in the country is not a single network that is easy to switch on or off.Rather, a bit like in the UK, it is formed of a series of privately-owned networks that link together. Disrupting such a system is not straightforward.However, connections to the outside world in Iran are funnelled through just two entities: the state telecoms firm and the Institute for Physics and Mathematics, which means that authorities are more easily able to block communications in and out of the country.""If you architect your country's internet access so you control the gateways, i.e. create choke points, you can censor at will,"" says Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at the University of Surrey.NetBlocks has been able to detect the disconnection of internet devices with fixed line connections as well as the loss of service at mobile phone masts - which demonstrates that wireless mobile internet is also disrupted.One Iranian journalist managed to tweet a message to the outside world via a proxy server - an internet device that links two separate networks together in order to transmit data between them. After dozens of attempts, he succeeded.It might also be possible for individuals in Iran to use satellite internet or roaming SIM cards to access the wider internet.However, these methods are not guaranteed to work and may be monitored by authorities.For most, the blackout is impenetrable.Behrang Tajdin, a correspondent with BBC Persian says that, like many of his colleagues, he has lost internet-based communications with contacts in the country.""I can't remember the last time that we had a full blackout for four days,"" he says.Tech firm Oracle's internet-monitoring service has described it as ""the largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran"".Mr Tajdin notes that Iran has spent years developing an internal ""intranet"" network so that certain branches of government and banks, for example, can stay online inside the country during shutdowns that cut Iran off from the outside world.""People can still access domestic websites that are connected to this network, which means that Iranian apps can work, websites can work although there's no [international] internet access,"" he explains.The existence of this internal intranet has caused alarm among those who think Iran could use it to justify ever longer and more disruptive internet shutdowns.Besides social consequences, there may be serious economic ones too, says Mr Toker.""We estimate that the economic impact to Iran is in the region of $60m (£46m) per day.""It's a harmful strategy and sets a dangerous precedent,"" he adds."
technology	Tech Tent - is it curtains for crypto?	Time for regulation?	"It was once the future of money but this week has seen Bitcoin lurch 20% lower, with other crypto-currencies suffering even more serious falls.On Tech Tent we ask whether the dream of a decentralised currency that would overturn the established financial system is over - and whether the regulators need to step in to protect naive investors.This week's turmoil seems to have been the result of the feuding which has seen Bitcoin Cash - itself a variant of the original Bitcoin - split into two currencies, with both of them plunging in value and the contagion spreading across the wider crypto-currency market.So is this just another dip in a volatile market or does this week tell us something more profound about the viability of crypto-currencies?Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the finance magazine Money Week and a long-term sceptic about Bitcoin, tells us she feels vindicated:""The things the old fuddy-duddies have been saying about crypto-currencies for the last couple of years turn out to be mainly true - that they're in the main vehicles for speculation, that the currencies in themselves have very little value. In most cases their value is around zero and that's where they're getting to gradually.""Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 (£15,600) a year ago, before settling between $6,000 and $7,000 for much of this year, and then lurching down towards $4,000 this week. The true believers insist that it will bounce back as it has before.Iqbal Gandham, of the crypto-currency trading firm eToro UK, gives us the startling prediction that Bitcoin will be worth anywhere between $500,000 and $1m over the next four or five years - although he adds the proviso that if it does not get to that level then it will have failed as a currency.eToro has spent heavily on marketing, buying adverts on the London Underground and sponsoring Premier League football clubs.As a result, it appears likely that it has enticed inexperienced investors into this market at a dangerous time, and I put it to Iqbal Gandham that many of them must be sitting on big losses.""Not really,"" he said,He said all investments had seen prices tumbling in recent weeks, with Apple and Amazon seeing very sharp falls in their shares.They, of course, are real businesses with huge assets whose shares trade in tightly regulated markets - Bitcoin could hardly be more different.In the UK, the Treasury, Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have been discussing whether there needs to be tighter regulation for the last couple of years.When I caught up with Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy for the FCA, he was keen to issue a warning: ""People will have to be aware that if they're thinking of investing in this space they could lose all their money.""He was less clear about whether regulation was coming: ""We do need to think about how suitable some of these investments - as they're perhaps being presented - really are for retail investors, ordinary customers.""Iqbal Gandham says his firm would welcome regulation although it is hard to see how the FCA would permit the marketing to football fans and tube travellers of what is essentially a gambling service.Merryn Somerset Webb is not completely dismissive about crypto-currencies - she says their underlying technology has ""huge potential to transform payments system and help the unbanked"".But she insists that doesn't tell you anything about the value of the currencies.She believes that we are in a period when investors are taking a long hard look at what is behind these crypto-assets - and are concluding they may be worthless."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook’s family feud		"Instagram and WhatsApp - two extraordinarily innovative businesses that have grown and prospered since they were acquired by Facebook. But now their founders have moved on and on this week's Tech Tent we look at the bitter row about how the companies have fared under Mark Zuckerberg.On Tuesday, Instagram's co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced, out of the blue, that they were leaving the company. On the face of it, this was hardly surprising - after all they'd sold their company for $1bn (£770m) back in 2012 and six years is a lot longer than many founders stay on after cashing in.The two said nothing negative in public about Facebook, but rumours quickly circulated that they had felt they were losing the independence they had been promised in running the image-sharing service and were unhappy with decisions about strategy.The next day, another former member of the Facebook family came out swinging with some scorching criticism of the way Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg managed a business they had acquired.Brian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for an eye-watering $22bn in 2014, revealed major disagreements over the monetisation of the service, and concerns about privacy. His remarks came in an interview with our Tech Tent special guest Parmy Olson from the business magazine Forbes.He left the company last year and a few months later, at the height of the scandal over the social network's use of data, he told his Twitter followers to delete Facebook.In the interview, he says Sheryl Sandberg shot down a plan he proposed to charge a fee to some major WhatsApp users rather than seek to advertise based on the service's data. He also says he was persuaded to tell the European Commission that blending WhatsApp and Facebook data would be very difficult, only to find out later that there were plans to do just that.And he now expresses regrets about the deal that made him a billionaire: ""I sold my users' privacy to a larger benefit. I made a choice and a compromise. And I live with that every day.""Perhaps unsurprisingly, Brian Acton's agonising has been greeted with some mockery in Silicon Valley. The tech journalist Kara Swisher quoted a friend's take on the affair:""I live with this guilt every day on this beach-front property here in Fiji. I can barely see my brand new 200ft yacht out there in the harbour through the tears I'm shedding for my users' privacy.""And from Facebook executive David Marcus there was anger rather than humour.The man who heads the social network's experimental blockchain project rushed to defend Mark Zuckerberg's management of acquired companies. In a personal blogpost he said WhatsApp's team had been given unprecedented autonomy, all sorts of special treatment - larger desks, their own conference rooms - and a lengthy period without pressure to come up with a business model.And then there was this: ""Call me old-fashioned. But I find attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire, and went to an unprecedented extent to shield and accommodate you for years, low-class. It's actually a whole new standard of low-class.""Plenty of dirty linen being washed in public then. While many may feel that it is a bit rich to attack the people who made you, well, rich, this whole affair has made it another troubled week for Mark Zuckerberg.With Facebook growth slowing, he needs Instagram and WhatsApp to start contributing more to the bottom line and will have to hope the teams behind them have greater faith than Brian Acton in his leadership.Also on this week's programme: Does that Elon Musk tweet about having the funds secured to take Tesla private pose an existential threat to the electric car firm after the SEC charged its founder with misleading investors?And we try out an app that claims to help you to speak more confidently without umm sort of filler words….and, like, you know…..lengthy, errr, pauses."
technology	Tech Tent: Tim Cook’s privacy crusade	China contradiction?	"It's not unusual for the technology industry to be accused of playing fast and loose with user privacy, collecting data on a vast scale and needing to be reined in by new laws.What is startling is when that accusation comes from the leader of the world's most valuable technology company.On Tech Tent this week we ask just what Tim Cook's diatribe says about the debate on data.It is rare for Apple's chief executive to speak in public about anything other than the virtues of its latest products.But at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners in Brussels this week, he painted a dystopian picture of his industry.He described what he called a data industrial complex, with our data scooped up, traded and used to shape what we saw online.""Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponised against us with military efficiency,"" he told his audience of regulators.""We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.""He praised Europe's tough new privacy law the GDPR and called for the United States to bring in something similar.Now given how much irritation and hostility towards GDPR there was from American tech companies in the run-up to its implementation, this feels like a remarkable turnaround. Even more remarkably, the message about the merits of regulation was backed by Mark Zuckerberg.In a video message to the same conference, he said Facebook shared the values behind GDPR.Mind you, he insisted that users were aware of the trade-off between a free service and advertisements, and what that involved in terms of their data.""People consistently tell us that they want a free service and that if they going to see ads to get it, then they want those ads to be relevant,"" he said.Others made the point that it is easy for Tim Cook to take a sanctimonious line on privacy, when Apple's business model depends on selling expensive hardware rather than collecting vast amounts of data to use in targeting advertising.Alex Stamos, who's just stepped down as Facebook's Chief Technology Officer, was quick to point out that Apple doesn't give much privacy to Chinese iPhone users who are barred from installing a VPN to get round censorship.He said on Twitter that the media had given Tim Cook an easy ride.While Facebook and Apple may bicker about their different business models, both seem to have recognised that new GDPR-style regulation is inevitable.The irony is that there is one place where they don't seem so keen on that idea - the White House.The Trump administration's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross warned in May that GDPR could harm transatlantic trade.Since then, there have been some vague discussions of a new US privacy law, but in a more diluted form than its European equivalent.In his Brussels speech, Tim Cook warned that there would be opposition to the kind of strict regulation he favours: ""Some oppose any form of privacy legislation. Others will endorse reform in public, and then resist and undermine it behind closed doors.""But Apple's boss says technology will not achieve its true potential unless it has the full faith and confidence of the people who use it. Prepare for a long battle over just how much regulation is needed to win back that trust.Also in this week's programme:"
technology	Parents struggle to handle children's tech habits	Tech nativesE-parenting tips	"Parents worry about how excessive mobile use is affecting their children but struggle to tame their tech habits, suggests a survey.It found that 43% of 7,000 parents across Europe who were surveyed were concerned that using gadgets meant their children slept poorly.Others feared what tablet and phone use did to social skills (38%) and children's mental health (32%).But many said they set a bad example with their own heavy use of gadgetsCompiled by security firm Norton, the survey the parents what their children - ranging in age from five to 16 - did with gadgets, and how long they spent staring at them.Based on the findings, children now seem to crave screen time with their tablets and phones more than they do sugar and sweets. British children were more likely to be looking at a screen than playing outside, and almost a quarter - 23% - were online more than their parents.On average, it found, British children spent three hours a day on their screens.""Modern parenting isn't easy,"" said Nick Shaw, general manager of Norton Europe, in a statement.""The old challenges of getting children to eat their greens, get to bed on time and do their homework are all still there, but there is an added layer of technology that parents have to navigate,"" he added.The fact that few parents grew up with connected devices often left them struggling to cope and work out what were good rules, said Mr Shaw.Parents were also conflicted because they saw the value in their children being familiar with technology, he said. About 60% of those asked said the technology helped their children learn and almost as many - 53% - said it made their offspring happy.The survey revealed that 9% of parents questioned set no rules on use, and 65% let their children use gadgets alone in their bedrooms. And 49% said they wanted to set limits but were not sure how to go about it.Of those questioned, 43% lamented that children would be able to get around the rules and restrictions they put in place.""We all should be mindful of how much time we spend online and tackle the issue of excessive screen time, with parents setting a good example,"" said Mr Shaw, adding that 58% of the surveyed parents now had ""tech-free"" times or days when everyone put their gadgets away."
technology	2018: BBC Tech's biggest stories and what happened next		"When tech historians of the future look back at 2018, it may stand out as the year that the wheels came off Facebook or at least its original platform.Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent.So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018.Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch.Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge.January: Chipocalypse NowSoftware flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community.Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products.At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs.A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance.February: Fake pornDeepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter.Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise.In September, Google also introduced the ability for victims of what it termed ""involuntary fake pornography"" to have the material removed from the firm's search results.As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique to create bogus videos of politicians.But there's another worrying trend.It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums.March: Cambridge AnalyticaDonald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages.But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house as a honey-trap.Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a ""data breach"".When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since.""We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,"" he said.April: Scandal growsBy early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz.Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact ""only"" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens.That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May.But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica.The £500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly.But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow.May: RIP TotalBiscuitThe British video games critic John ""TotalBiscuit"" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015.By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly.Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed.The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement.It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy. They said his involvement had been mischaracterised and noted that Mr Bain had called for ethics in games journalism for several years before GamerGate existed.June: Data from the deepThe phrase ""the cloud"" conjures up images of our data being stored in some nebulous form high above us.In reality, tech firms are investing billions of pounds in racks of computer servers housed in gigantic data centres across the globe to power the apps we use and internet services we call on.For the most part, these are built at ground-level. But in June, Microsoft sank an experimental data centre into the sea off Orkney in the north of Scotland.The idea is to reduce cooling costs by keeping the equipment in a sealed vault underwater.The tech giant intends to monitor Project Natick for five years to see if the scheme is a practical proposition for a wider rollout.But elsewhere, Google revealed it had already made the switch to liquid-cooling to tackle the heat given off by its latest artificial intelligence-focused computer servers.But rather than dropping its equipment overboard, it is piping coolant to each chip.July: Thoughtless threatPayPal was guilty of a major faux pas when it wrote to Lindsay Durdle, one of its recently deceased customers, to say her death was a breach of its rules.To make matters worse, it added that it might take legal action as a consequence.Her husband Howard Durdle was appalled, and to be fair so was PayPal's PR team when the BBC brought the matter to its attention.Although the firm was unable to confirm exactly what had gone wrong it attempted to make good on the situation by writing off a debt his wife had owed.""PayPal have been in touch, have apologised sincerely and have promised to change whatever they need to internally to ensure this can't happen again,"" Mr Durdle tweeted after the BBC's article was published.""I just hope more organisations can apply empathy and common sense to avoid hurting the recently bereaved.""August: Mystery satelliteAs official statements go, the US State Department's wasn't the most reassuring: ""We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.""The subject was a Russian satellite that had been launched 10 months earlier and was displaying abnormal behaviour.One US official suggested it could be a space weapon designed to destroy other satellites - an allegation a Russian diplomat slammed as being ""unfounded [and] slanderous"".For those who track such developments, the US's suspicions echoed those raised about another Russian launch four years earlier when what was thought to be a bit of debris started zipping about in orbit.In any case, at the end of the year we are officially none the wiser about the objects true capabilities.But with the Trump administration pursuing its own plan to create a Space Force by 2020, off-planet militarisation looks set to remain a hot topic.September: Facebook flawWith the Cambridge Analytica scandal still ratting along, Facebook revealed that a separate problem had exposed almost 50 million accounts to being hijacked.The cause was a vulnerability in the code of its View As privacy facility, which was designed to let users see what their profile looked like to others.At the time, Facebook said it was ""temporarily turning off"" the tool while it conducted a review. Three months on, it remains disabled.The firm did, however, revise its estimate down to 30 million accounts.While we're on the topic, here's some of Facebook's other controversies in 2018:In an end of year message posted yesterday, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had become much more ""proactive"" at addressing the challenges it faced but warned some problems could ""never be fully solved"".But overall, he said he was ""proud of the progress"" Facebook had made in 2018.October: Power struggleMany of us have experienced the sinking feeling that comes from leaving the home in the morning to discover your smartphone battery never recharged overnight.Typically, it's a case of failing to properly plug the handset in. But a YouTuber's tests of the latest iPhones indicated some of the new devices only topped up their power if their displays were ""woken up"" first.Inevitably this was dubbed ""chargegate"", and when the BBC published its take on the issue Apple had yet to comment.But a week later, when it released the next version of its mobile operating system, Apple's accompanying notes confirmed it had fixed a bug that had caused the flaw.November: #DontbeevilAt the start of the year the Time's Up movement was founded to take a stand against sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It was a response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein but also marked an effort to tackle problems faced by women more widely.Eleven months later, seven of Google's employees declared ""time's up"" on the tech giant after accusations of misconduct emerged involving two past male high-fliers as well as dozens of other staff.As a result, workers at Google's offices across the world staged a series of walkouts. Managers were delivered a set of demands, including a call to end the firm's requirement that sexual harassment disputes be dealt with internally.About a week later, Google's chief Sundar Pichai confirmed that the business would indeed stop its policy of forced arbitration, opening the door to it being sued over the matter in the future.December: Glitter bombThe internet fell in love with a revenge prank staged by an ex-Nasa engineer earlier this month.After having a package stolen from his porch, Mark Rober constructed a ""bomb"" that married a centrifugal motor, lots of glitter, fart spray and several smartphones.He then hid the device within an Apple Homepod speaker box and left it on his porch.When thieves subsequently stole it, it recorded the moment it sprayed them with its contents. After which, Mr Rober retrieved the package and repeated the exercise.In an ideal world, the story would have ended there, with Mr Rober's YouTube fame assured thanks to the compilation video he made.But a couple of days after uploading the footage, the inventor replaced the video with a shorter edit.Some viewers had voiced suspicions about parts of the footage, and Mr Rober acknowledged that when he had chased up their concerns he had discovered that one of his helpers had recruited acquaintances to pose as two of the five featured thieves.""I'm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn't just taint the entire effort as 'fake',"" he tweeted.Most viewers seem to have been forgiving, but it's unfortunate that what was a fun stunt might cause many to be more suspicious and cynical about what they see online in the future."
technology	Tech Tent: Has Facebook reached peak crisis?	'We didn't know'	"Two of the biggest names in tech are facing serious questions about their ethics. Facebook stands accused of dirty tactics to smear opponents, Google of breaking promises on data.On Tech Tent we look at a difficult week for the reputation of Silicon Valley.It was a lengthy investigation in the New York Times which sparked a new crisis at Facebook. It examined the tactics the company used to deal with the recent crises over Russian interference in elections and the harvesting of data by Cambridge Analytica.The article painted chief executive Mark Zuckerberg as strangely detached from many decisions while chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was running what it called ""an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation"".That included hiring a Washington lobbying firm Definers which spread stories that George Soros - a hate figure for conservatives and the subject of anti-Semitic smears - was behind the anti-Facebook movement.Lots of questions then not just about Facebook's ethics but whether its two most senior executives are up to the job. In a 90-minute telephone press conference, which to his credit he kept extending, Mark Zuckerberg was quizzed about these issues.Reporters returned time and again to the hiring of the firm Definers Public Affairs and its role in attacking Facebook's opponents. ""I learned about this reading the New York Times,"" was Zuckerberg's somewhat startling response. He said he was not very comfortable employing this kind of opposition research firm and got straight on the phone to make sure they were dropped.Sheryl Sandberg said she also had not known about Definers. But in a Facebook post she rejected allegations that she'd tried to suppress information about Russian interference. She admitted they'd been too slow to wake up to the Russian threat but went on: ""To suggest that we weren't interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew, or that we tried to prevent investigations, is simply untrue.""Facebook can expect further questions from investors and regulators over just who is in charge and why the company always seems one step behind those using its platform for malicious ends.Google's problems are not on the same scale but the row this week over alleged broken promises also reflected its failure to understand public unease about its motives.This week its London-based DeepMind artificial intelligence business announced that its health activities, in particular a smartphone app for hospital doctors called Streams, were being handed over to the Google mother ship.Hardly a shock you might think, except for the fact that DeepMind's founders have always stressed their independence and had promised there would never be a risk that sensitive patient records would be poured into Google's ocean of data.Privacy campaigner and legal academic Dr Julia Powles tweeted:""This is TOTALLY unacceptable. DeepMind repeatedly, unconditionally promised to *never* connect people's intimate, identifiable health data to Google. Now it's announced...exactly that.""Content is not availableBut DeepMind Health's medical director Dr Dominic King tells Tech Tent that there have been and will continue to be very strict controls on how patient data is used: ""This health data is not DeepMind's or Google's data. It belongs to the partners we work with, whether the National Health Service or internationally, and that's not going to change with this move.""He concedes that people might worry that information about their health might be used later to target them with advertising - but guarantees that will not happen. ""What's important is that this data is not being used by other parts of Google for services that our partners and their patients would not expect to happen.""But when we put that guarantee to Julia Powles she still was not satisfied: ""Without any public engagement, a global company has now got access to the heart of one of the most prized socialised health services in the world.""What this highlights is the ebbing away of trust in the giant Californian companies. Google's mission to organise the world's information and Facebook's promise to bring the world closer together sounded fine a few years ago - now many of us no longer want them to play such a big role in our lives."
technology	Tech Tent: Can we trust the telecoms giants?	'Digital catastrophe'Also on this week's podcast:	"This week, a basic error by Sweden's Ericsson took millions of mobile customers offline, while its Chinese rival Huawei faced mounting pressure from those who consider it a security risk.On the latest Tech Tent podcast, we ask: can we trust the telecoms industry?Early on Thursday, more than 30 million mobile phone users in the UK found that they could not get access to their data service.Similar problems were reported by mobile operators in Japan and China. The outage at the O2 network lasted for nearly 24 hours and served to underline how dependent we have become on being connected while on the move.A few years ago this incident would have been a minor annoyance to the small number of smartphone users.But average monthly mobile data use has increased twenty-fold in the UK since 2011, with phone owners using them for everything from streaming music to ordering taxis and takeaways.For the increasing number of people and businesses that depend on mobile apps to organise their work, this was more than an inconvenience - it cost them money.Deliveroo couriers and Uber drivers could not work if they used O2. The information system at London bus stops was out of action, and a care agency that despatched staff to people's homes via an app reported that the outage ""brought our company to a halt"".""It's a digital catastrophe,"" the mobile analyst Marta Pinto from the IDC consultancy tells us. ""People are blocked out from their lives, from their social media, from their banks, from their data, even from their pictures in the cloud.""At the start of the day, O2 had blamed a software problem with an unnamed ""third-party provider"".It soon emerged that this was the Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson, which then issued an apology and this startling admission: ""An initial root cause analysis indicates that the main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers.""Our special guest Kate Bevan, of Which Computing, tells us she put her head in her hands and groaned when she heard this.""It's a really basic thing,"" she says. ""A certificate sets up the encrypted connection between the server and your device.""If certificates are allowed to expire, as happened here, everything falls over.But if one of the world's major telecoms providers was fouling up, its biggest rival was having an even worse week.China's Huawei was already under pressure as the US told its allies not to trust a firm it claims is closely linked to the Chinese government.Later, one of its most senior executives was arrested in Canada. She faces extradition to the US, apparently accused of busting sanctions on Iran.Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward tells us we should be concerned about these clouds over two of the biggest players in global telecoms.Speaking of Ericsson's error, he says: ""Inadvertently it managed to take down a whole network. Imagine if somebody tried to do that deliberately.""He points out that firms like Huawei ""hail from countries where their governments have extraordinary powers to compel them to do things"".The EU Commissioner Andrus Ansip echoed that view on Friday, suggesting that firms such as Huawei were required to co-operate with Chinese intelligence services, by installing back doors in their equipment and producing chips that could be used ""to get our secrets"".Huawei hit back, saying it had ""never been asked by any government to build any back doors or interrupt any networks"" and ""would never tolerate such behaviour by any of our staff"".Ericsson, Huawei and Finland's Nokia are competing to build the next generation 5G networks.In the 5G era, just about everything as well as everybody will be connected to the internet. That means any failure - whether inadvertent or deliberate - could cause chaos on a different scale from what we saw this week."
technology	British tech giant in Khashoggi dilemma	Desert Davos	"In 2016 the company widely seen as the jewel in the crown of the UK technology sector was sold.Japan's Softbank paid a whopping £24bn for the Cambridge-based smartphone chip designer ARM Holdings, part of an epic spending spree which has seen it invest in a whole range global tech firms.Theresa May hailed the sale as a vote of confidence in Britain, Softbank promised to increase investment in Cambridge, and ARM executives seemed confident that they would still be in charge, just with more money to spend.One man, co-founder Hermann Hauser was not happy about ARM's loss of independence. He warned: ""The future of ARM could have been determined by the UK management team. Now it will be determined in Japan.""Since then Softbank has offloaded a quarter of ARM to its Saudi-backed Vision Fund. In July, Bloomberg reported that Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had joined the board of ARM Holdings.In other words, the future of the the chipmaker is now being determined in Riyadh as well as Tokyo. And now that has landed the company with an ethical dilemma following the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, presumed murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Next week ARM's chief executive Simon Segars is due to be a speaker at a grand investment conference in Saudi Arabia which has been dubbed Davos in the Desert, one of a number of executives from Softbank-owned companies due to be there. A number of other attendees from across the technology and financial world have pulled out of the event.The UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has just announced that ""the time is not right"" for him to attend the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh.On Monday afternoon, I asked ARM's PR team, with whom I've had plenty of amiable dealings in the past, whether Mr Segars still planned to attend.I have been asking ever since, without receiving any clear reply. To be fair, ARM's whole leadership team is currently in California for a company conference where senior figures from Softbank have been among the speakers.I imagine that Mr Segars has been closeted in meetings with his board and his Softbank bosses, agonising over whether to fly to Riyadh next week. The betting must be that he will not go.But what this whole affair shows is that ownership does matter. The ethical as well as the commercial direction of a great British technology business is now in the hands of overseas owners who may not share its values."
technology	CES 2019: Amazon and Google Assistant carve up tech expo	First-mover advantage	"At CES, there's no shortage of gadgets to talk to. Smart TVs, cars, pianos - and even a toilet - these are just some examples of devices that come with voice-activated helpers.No matter who makes the hardware, the virtual aide linked to or packaged inside is likely to be one of two: either Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant.For ShadeCraft, the maker of a new device that lets garden parasols be controlled by voice, Alexa was simply more straight-forward to build in.""It was much easier and simpler to integrate,"" explains chief executive Armen Gharabegian. ""But we have been testing Google voice as well.""Users can ask Alexa to open or close the sunshades mechanically, or play music via Bloom's speakers. But ShadeCraft wants to integrate Alexa completely, so that the parasol behaves just like an Amazon Echo smart speaker.Voice commands such as ordering Amazon products or asking what the weather will be like could then be done from the patio as well as the living room.Amazon has made it hassle-free to add Alexa to products, by offering the assistant on a single chip - the Alexa Connect Kit.It has been available for a few months now, but at CES Google just announced their equivalent tool with a strikingly similar name - Google Assistant Connect.However, any product using that chip will have to wirelessly connect to a Google smart device, which will process voice data.Still, in time, Bloom customers may be able to choose to talk to Google Assistant instead of Alexa.""I think that we are perfectly positioned to be the extension of the AI hub outdoors,"" said Mr Gharabegian.More from CES 2019:The benefit of this would be to give users access to the particular functionality offered by different virtual helpers.Google Assistant, for example, tends to be better at answering queries about the wider world than Alexa. It also has exclusive access to some of the search firm's other products, letting users control Chromecast audio streams or display YouTube and Google Maps on devices with screens.Alexa, by contrast, is more widely supported by third-party products and has more apps.Another firm that thinks its customers may be best at deciding how to interact verbally with its devices is Sonos.It has shown off a prototype smart speaker that allows users to select either Alexa or Google Assistant, though it isn't possible to activate them both at the same time.Part of the problem is that interacting with multiple virtual helpers through one device could get confusing.""Say an alarm goes off on the speaker,"" writes Dieter Bohn at tech site The Verge. ""You might not know whether it was Alexa or Google that set it off, and you'd be stuck guessing which one to ask to stop while it beeps.""However, in time, people may well become accustomed to using both assistants interchangeably, and even others like Apple's Siri or Samsung's Bixby, depending on what they want to do.""[Consumers] will be entrenched in one of those ecosystems and so the manufacturer of appliances is not going to want to lose sales to consumers who prefer one of them,"" says Ross Rubin at market analysts Reticle Research.But for now the land grab is everything, which is why executives at Amazon must be feeling pleased with Alexa's progress.Amazon is estimated to have 41% of the global smart speaker market while Google comes in second, taking 28%. Alexa's dominance is visible across a wide range of other products too.""Alexa had made the first-mover advantage and for a few years, that was the dominant integration technology at CES,"" explains Mr Rubin. ""Google has stepped up its presence year after year.""Some, though, remain sceptical that voice assistants add much value to most products.""They're putting Alexa in everything and I'm getting a little bit tired of it,"" one user-interface specialist from a major car-maker told the BBC at CES.""If I want to open my toilet why should I tell Alexa to open my toilet instead of opening it myself?""The specialist, who wishes to remain anonymous, noted how the ""sheer force"" of Amazon's marketing was particularly noticeable at the tech trade show this year.One other CES attendee concurred, tweeting: ""To say that Amazon Alexa is everywhere at CES in Las Vegas would be an understatement.""Mr Rubin thinks that there are certain gadgets where the benefit of hands-free control does make sense.Take kitchen appliances, for instance.Instead of trying to finger a recipe book or smartphone with - literally - butter fingers, you can ask a voice assistant to call out the directions or repeat something if you need to hear it again.The hands-free use case applies to Focals - a new range of stylish smart glasses made by Toronto-based firm North.Focals project a colour display into the wearer's eyeball by bouncing it off the lens to create a hologram-like visual in the right eye. This is used to relay text messages or directions to a place, for instance.""The result that you get is a small transparent display that sits about an arm's length in front of you,"" says spokesman Alexander Ingram.With Alexa and a speaker on board, there's another option - just listen to the information instead.North received investment from Amazon and so has built Alexa into Focals - but Mr Ingram says there are no plans to keep the glasses as an Alexa-only product.""By being able to take these assistants out of the home and into the world, that just opens up a huge range of new applications,"" he said.There is another way to bring voice activation to a product without having to rely on one of the tech giants' assistants.Snips lets firms build their own voice tools that run solely on the devices they were intended for.So, if you want to make a coffee machine that simply responds to a handful of crucial commands, it would be an option.What's more, by not relying on Amazon's or Google's servers, users would not need to bother connecting their new coffee machine to the cloud before asking it for a cappuccino. And that avoids the risk of a cyber-security scandal or other privacy issue.""This kind of information should stay in your home, it should not go elsewhere, to a server on the opposite side of the world,"" said the firm's vice president of product, Sebastien Maury.Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019"
technology	Raids mounted on fake Indian tech support centres		"More than 50 people have been arrested in India for their alleged involvement in fake security warning scams.The New York Times said that Delhi police made the arrests during raids on 26 call centres linked to the scams.Software giant Microsoft helped police trace who was behind the large-scale operations.It said it received more than 11,000 calls per month about fake security warnings and that many people lost significant sums to the fraudsters.""This is an organised crime,"" Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft's digital crimes unit told the US newspaper.Microsoft has estimated that fraudsters make about $1.5bn (£1.2bn) a year through fake Windows support calls.Raids on 16 call centres were carried out this week and, earlier in November, another 10 locations were visited by police.The raids were prompted by Microsoft filing complaints with local police in New Delhi about call centres it claimed were involved in the fraudulent operations.Typically, said Microsoft, attempts to trick people revolved around pop-up warnings that falsely claimed that a person's computer was infected with a virus.Fixing the non-existent virus could involve ringing a tech support centre. An operator would talk a victim through a fake fix and then charge them for the work.In another version of the scam, staff at call centres claimed to be calling from Windows official support saying they had spotted that a person's computer has been hacked or harboured a virus. Again, victims were expected to pay to fix the non-existent problem.Some people caught out by the scam paid up to $1,000 for the fake tech support, said the newspaper.Microsoft has published advice about ways to spot the fake calls and avoid becoming a victim."
technology	Tech Tent: Is Twitter besieged by bots?	DebunkingAlso on the podcast this week:	"How should we see Twitter? An essential communications tool? A noisy but enlightening platform for democratic debate? Or a haven for hate speech often driven by armies of bots designed to inject poison into every conversation?In this week's Tech Tent podcast, we examine how the social media firm is facing accusations that it is failing to police its platform properly.Twitter is in the spotlight after it emerged that it was used by Cesar Sayoc, the man accused of a bombing campaign aimed at leading American politicians.In at least one case, someone reported a threat by Mr Sayoc but was told that Twitter's rules had not been broken.Meanwhile, there is evidence that many of the raging debates on Twitter are driven by bots. In other words, when you see thousands of angry tweets about a news story, they may be generated automatically by a computer, not a human.That is the verdict of a group of students at the University of California in Berkeley. They have created a tool called factcheck.me that allows anyone to track bot activity and understand how viral photos and links take off.Kyle Rentschler, one of the team behind the project, told Tech Tent that as many as 60% of the tweets about a migrant caravan making its way through Mexico towards the United States were generated by bots.How can he be sure that these were not human tweets?""Many of these accounts tweet at inhuman levels, like a tweet every minute or so, for days or weeks at a time,"" he says.But the tweets are not all coming from one side of the argument. Some are fear-mongering about the caravan, others are dismissing the whole affair as a mythical problem.While Twitter did start rooting out the bots in the summer, Kyle says there is still a long way to go: ""It's still a huge issue and nowhere near to being solved.""Another area where Twitter is under fire is over its handling of complaints about fake news designed to stir up hatred.Early this week, a number of Twitter accounts shared a photo of what they claimed was billionaire George Soros in a Nazi uniform back in World War Two.It was an obvious lie. The Twitter account of the Auschwitz Museum responded by pointing out that the picture was of Oskar Groening, a member of the SS. George Soros was only 14 at the end of the war.After the deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, and with Soros among those targeted with bombs through the post, this was both an anti-Semitic smear and fake news.But try to report a Tweet as a lie and you run up against a problem. Fake news is not a category that Twitter lists as a cause for action. And while many people have been reporting the fake photo as ""abusive or harmful"" it is still going viral on Twitter.Tech Tent asked Twitter for an interview about these issues but was told that nobody was available.The company provided a lengthy statement, which did not answer our detailed questions about that Soros smear. It did say Twitter was moving with a ""sense of urgency and commitment"" to improve the health of the public conversation.It continued: ""We're not always going to get it right but we firmly believe that we need to be thoughtful and considered in our approach, balancing freedom of expression with people's absolute need to feel safe online. While we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we will not tolerate behaviour that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others."""
technology	CES 2019: Tech preview of the expo's hottest new gadgets	AI assistants and smart livingFood and drinkTelevisionsRobotsHealth and beautySmartphones and other computersDronesTransportBlockchain and other curiosities	"The CES trade show is powering up again in Vegas. Most of the biggest names in tech and stacks of start-ups you've never heard of will compete for attention over the next week.Some products may launch new categories - past events presented a first look at video cassette recorders (VCRs), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs and Android tablets. But many more will flop or never even make it to market.We've scoured the internet for hints about what will be on show...One of the biggest developments at the last few CES expos has been Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant's rival efforts to extend their reach in the home and beyond.Last year things peaked with an Alexa-activated toilet flush, but over the past 12 months manufacturers have developed voice-controlled ""skills"" or ""actions"" for more products, and in some cases embedded one of the virtual assistants outright.For 2019, we're being promised tags that will let smart speakers tell you where your pet or TV remote is hiding, as well as Alexa/Google Assistant-controlled pianos, heart rate monitors, lawnmowers, motorcycle helmets and meditation lamps.That's not to say others aren't trying to muscle in.Samsung is rumoured to be revealing a fresh Galaxy Home speaker powered by its smart assistant Bixby, and German start-up Autolabs will demo Chris - a virtual helper designed for use in cars.Several firms will also urge developers to get behind ""open source"" alternatives, in which neither of the two tech giants act as gatekeeper to the apps on offer.For example, Volareo will show progress on a crowdfunded smart speaker that lets you buy Bitcoin and stream any video to your TV.Others will be pitching ways to drive the category forward.So, for example, Elliptic Labs will demo a radar-like system that lets smart speakers detect their owners' approach. It suggests the tech could be used to trigger daily reminders or to make the speakers adjust their volume according to how close the person is.Taking things one step further, Smart IoT Labs has Miranda - a kind of smart assistant for smart assistants that issues commands on your behalf to Alexa or Google based on your past behaviour, which sounds a bit bonkers.And for consumers still wary about talking to their tech, Mui Lab has a ""calmer"" alternative.At first sight its product looks like a plank of wood, but when touched it lights up to provide a way to control Google's Assistant with swipes and presses rather than barked commands.Nespresso has a lot to answer for.The success of its pod-based coffee machines has inspired several start-ups to take the capsule-based concept and extend it to other kitchen gadgets.Lecker Labs has Yomee - to which you add milk and the pod of your choosing to create yoghurt.Mitte has a machine that passes water through a choice of cartridges to add rock minerals to it and avoid the need to buy bottles of the stuff.And even LG is getting in on the act with HomeBrew, a product that makes beer from single-use capsules containing malt, yeast, and hop oil. It's presumably targeted at drinkers who think ""craft brewing"" extends to a button push.Meanwhile, Capsulier is back at CES with a production version of its DIY coffee and tea pods-maker, after recently starting shipments to its Kickstarter backers.Switching tack, other intriguing foodie developments include gadgets that claim to help you improve your diet by analysing your breath.Lumen says it will have a working prototype of its ""hack your metabolism"" device, which determines the proportion of carbs and fats being burnt for energy from the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air you exhale.It then makes food recommendations based on the result.By contrast, FoodMarble's Aire measures the hydrogen in your breath and combines this with a log of what you have eaten, to warn you of foods you should avoid and possible substitutions.There's always fancy new fridges at the show, but it's doubtful they have yet advanced to the point they can tell you when you need to eat each item by - the holy grail of kitchen tech.But Ovie has an interim solution.It will show off SmartTags that you're supposed to attach to each foodstuff and identify to Alexa as you do so.Their colour then changes as the food goes off, while an app suggests recipes to make from near-expired items.TVs have been at the heart of CES ever since it started 52 years ago.This year, the hot rumour is that LG will reveal a commercial version of a roll-up concept it previously demoed, meaning families can have a giant screen without sacrificing one of their walls.Samsung may also have a rival set if a patent, sneaked out on Christmas Day, is anything to go by. Its design appears to open up horizontally rather than vertically.Failing that, it's likely to have more to say on its modular MicroLED tech, in which lots of small panels are clipped together to form a screen. Last year it showed off a 146in (371cm) 4K display, but it needs to create smaller versions for the innovation to be practical in the living room.Expect lots of talk about 8K too, with sets featuring four times as many pixels as today's 4K standard.Japan's recent switch-on of the world's first ""super high-definition"" channel means there's now an audience for the feature, even if content elsewhere is in short supply.Although stores already stock 8K models, existing units lack HDMI 2.1 ports. The new cable standard is required to provide enough bandwidth to send a 60 frames-per-second 8K signal over a single connection, as well as having other benefits.LG has already confirmed it will debut the technology and other brands are likely to do likewise.The other development to watch out for is TVs featuring far-field microphones - the tech found in smart speakers that lets them be commanded from across a room.This could free owners from having to use a remote control.Toshiba has already announced one such model for Europe featuring Alexa. A wider roll-out could give Amazon and Google's smart assistants another gateway into people's homes.Robot-makers at CES typically promise much, but their inventions often struggle to justify their existence. Worse - if you remember Cloi last year - they can have a tendency to misbehave.But the lead developer of one of the category's rare success stories - Softbank's Pepper - is at CES this year with a droid that he believes has the capacity to ""touch hearts"".Kaname Hayashi will be demoing Lovot, a chick-like bot with large expressive eyes, flapping arms, wheels, and a wardrobe of clothes to cover its soft shell.A camera protrudes from its head, allowing it to map rooms and act as a child monitor or home surveillance device.But Mr Hayashi has said the purpose of Lovot is not to be helpful or entertaining, but rather to engender joy, love and other positive emotions that might help owners reach their true potential.He's not the only one suggesting the time has come to welcome companion bots into our homes.There's Kiki, a ""pet robot"" designed by two former Google engineers, whose personality evolves according to how its owners treat it.And Liku, a humanoid bot that promises to express ""desires and emotions"" driven by what's going on in its surroundings.Others, however, remain focused on addressing more practical problems.Coral will show off what it says is the first robot vacuum to feature a detachable handheld unit.Occo has a new version of its photo-taking model that interacts with guests at events before getting them to pose for automated snaps.And Cowarobot follows up an earlier self-driving suitcase with ShopPal - a unit designed for use in stores to follow customers about, drawing their attention to promotions and offering to recharge their mobile devices.The US's opioid crisis, in which hundreds of people are dying every week after becoming addicted to pain medication, has driven several medical tech firms into action.Several new products are based on neuromodulation therapy, which involves stimulating the spinal cord or peripheral nerves to try to interrupt pain signals before they reach the brain. The technique has been around since the 1980s, but traditionally required surgery for an implant.Some start-ups, however, are attempting to offer non-surgical solutions.They include Lenus Freedom, which says its electrical nerve field stimulator can be fitted by a physician in five minutes.Meanwhile, PainCareLabs has a prototype called DuoTherm that it says alters nerve activity linked to back pain by applying heat and vibration pressure rather than electric pulses.But experts have doubts.""The challenge is far greater than these start-ups portray,"" Prof Sam Eldabe of the British Pain Society told the BBC.""[One issue] is that tolerance develops to spinal cord stimulation in around 20% of subjects, and we know the same occurs for peripheral nerve stimulation.""For those who still need to take pills or regular injections, there's a barrage of new ""smart"" medication boxes in which to keep them.Pillo appears to be the most elaborate example. The dispenser features an animated smart companion that uses facial recognition to ensure the right person gets the right dose at the right time.It's worth being a bit sceptical about some of the supposed breakthroughs, though.Lexilight's website, for example, claims the rapidly-flashing lamp it will display can help dyslexic people ""read as fast as everyone else"".It's based on a theory that the condition is caused by an unusual arrangement of light-receptor cells in the eyes of those with the disorder.But the scientists who proposed the idea said more tests were needed when they announced their theory last year, and several experts in the field were dismissive of it.Likewise, bold claims are being made of some of the beauty tech that will go on show.Y-Brush, for instance, says its nylon-bristled mouthpiece can give teeth a ""perfect"" clean in 10 seconds.And Gillette claims a new razor with a battery-powered heating bar will increase glide and reduce tug to deliver the ""comfort of a hot towel shave"".At one point it looked like the big story of CES 2019 would be flexible phones.China's Royole still intends to show off its smartphone-tablet hybrid the FlexPai, having demoed a pre-production unit in October.But famed leaker Evan Blass has backtracked from claims that LG will unveil a version of its own.The BBC understands Huawei is also biding its time. And that means Samsung - which has already given the world a brief glimpse of its foldable Galaxy X - is likely to wait until February's Mobile World Congress to properly show off the device.Instead, your best bet of seeing a big-name brand with new folding tech may be Intel and its Copper Harbor dual-screened Windows PC.The chip-maker showed off a prototype in Singapore three months ago, but has yet to make a big fuss about the concept.Its two touchscreen panels can work together as a single big display, or let one act as a keyboard or scribble pad.For those looking to give their existing laptop more screen real estate, Mobile Pixels may have the solution.Its Duo accessory attaches a second display to the back of the main screen that can either be slid out to extend the view or be faced outwards to show off what the user is up to.Two start-ups from different sides of the world appear to have simultaneously invented another unusual peripheral.France's Nemeio and Australia's Sonder Design have created keyboards with small e-ink displays beneath each key.Users can switch from a Qwerty letter-layout to other designs, and also replace the characters with icons of their choosing to suit specialist applications or games.December's shutdown of Gatwick Airport is likely to be referenced by US Secretary of Transport Elaine Chao, who is giving a keynote speech that will address the promise and risks of consumer drones.But on the show floor, the biggest player in the business - DJI - has a positive story of its own to sell with a new model designed for the emergency services.It can stream split-screen video feeds of a scene in both heat vision and the normal visible spectrum, which could be useful in search-and-rescue missions.Astral AR is proposing something even more ambitious: an aircraft to stop school shootings.It claims drones could be used to obstruct an attacker and block their gunfire. An armour covering would supposedly make the machine difficult to destroy.At present the team is testing its ability to track a shooter's gaze and pose by using a commercial drone, but in time it hopes to deploy a smaller custom-designed solution.Sunflower Labs will propose what's perhaps a more realistic drone-based security system.It's pairing an aircraft called the Bee with motion-detecting lamps to offer a hi-tech way to deter intruders from homes and other properties.Drones will also be taking to the deep, with several firms showing off models designed for use in the sea.The idea is to provide a way to livestream scuba dives as well as to carry out inspections of boat hulls, underwater piping and other submerged objects.Expect to hear lots of talk about self-drive technologies, futuristic infotainment systems and 5G-based vehicle-to-vehicle data-swapping.But with Detroit's giant Auto Show overlapping with CES's final day, many car-makers are keeping back their big news.Even so, Mercedes appears ready to unveil a second-generation version of its CLA-Class fastback saloon at the Vegas event, and Nissan is rumoured to debut the e-Plus version of its Leaf electric car, offering extended battery life.Potentially more revolutionary, there will be at least two ""flying cars"" at the show.The Pal-V Liberty is a petrol-powered three-wheeler with fold-out rotary blades on its roof and a propeller at its rear, whose makers say it is self-stabilising in the air. It's based on a 20-year-old concept, but its maker claims it will be ready to deliver the first working units in 2020.NFT is at an earlier stage of development.The firm - which is headquartered near Google - promises an electric vehicle that will take off and land vertically but fly like a plane. It intends to reveal what it will look like at the expo.Other exotic vehicles at the show with a lot to prove include Pragma Industries' Alpha bicycle, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.It says the vehicle will have double the range of li-ion battery-based equivalents and none of the hassle of waiting hours for a recharge.Emerge will be showing off a scooter with a touchscreen steering wheel, which it says will discourage drivers from using their smartphones.And JackRabbit has a modern-day take on the Penny Farthing bicycle - with one wheel bigger than the other and an electric motor.It looks a bit awkward to ride but is supposedly nimble in use.And there's still so much more.For example, several start-ups are attempting to ride the hype-wave associated with blockchain and crypto-currencies.They include a coin-mining TV and a sports score business that rewards accurate predictions with crypto-currency as a means to work around online gambling laws.But the stand-out example may be Pigzbe - a handheld digital wallet targeted at six-year-olds that is supposed to replace pocket money.Supposedly one of the benefits over just using an online bank account is that it doesn't involve decimals, with which some youngsters struggle.But since it runs on a new digital currency, Wollo, you may end up having to explain why their savings have shrunk in value.There's a multitude of other new gizmos and apps on show - and here's a final selection that caught our eye.Scribit is a wall-drawing gadget that turns images sourced from the web into line art. When users tire of them, it uses a heating element to make the ink vanish.LiBest has put a flexible battery in a wristband that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch on the go and give it more than a day's battery life.CoCoon is a smart beehive that automatically tackles a mite that harms the insects, and can summon help if other problems arise.Finally, Audi and Disney are promising to show off the fruits of a two-year-long collaboration that they say has resulted in a completely new type of media designed to be experienced by backseat passengers. What can it be?CES press day begins on Sunday 6 January and the show runs until Saturday 12 January.You can follow all the BBC's coverage at bbc.com/ces2019 and keep track of the team involved via this Twitter list."
technology	Tech Tent: Google's empty chair		"Twitter and Facebook made the trip to Capitol Hill this week for a grilling by US senators - but it was the company which stayed away which copped most of the flak. On this week's Tech Tent, we ask whether Google made a huge tactical error in refusing to send one of its leaders to Washington.While Twitter sent its chief executive Jack Dorsey, and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg represented Facebook, Google only offered up its top lawyer. The senators wanted more star power in the form of company founder Larry Page or Google chief executive Sundar Pichai - and when they were unavoidably busy, the committee opted for an empty chair instead.Ms Sandberg is an accomplished speaker and once worked in Washington, so the fact that she survived the hearing relatively unscathed was not a surprise. She repeated the now familiar mantra that Facebook had made mistakes in not spotting Russian interference but was now employing hordes of staff to put things right.By contrast, many thought Twitter's Mr Dorsey - who described himself to the committee as ""someone of few words and typically pretty shy"" - would struggle to deal with the politicians' questions.In the event, his low droning voice seemed to lull them into submission, although he was forced to admit in a later hearing before another congressional committee that Twitter's algorithms had not always been impartial, reducing the visibility of 600,000 accounts for no clear reason.But time and again, the senators chose to thank the Twitter and Facebook executives for turning up and bemoaned the absence of Google.After the Intelligence Committee's hearing, our man Dave Lee spoke to the leading Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who was quick to attack Google.""I would hope after Americans saw that empty chair, that somebody in Google's management or somebody on their board would come to their senses and say, 'hey we need to answer American policymakers' questions',"" he said.Among those questions would be just what Google was playing at in China, where it is apparently exploring providing a search engine that would comply with the Chinese authorities' censorship demands. Perhaps the firm's senior executives decided that the danger of being trapped into saying something that might come back to bite them was just too high.But they may have misjudged. Immediately after the Senate hearing, the US Department of Justice announced an inquiry into the activities of the social media firms.It said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who may be keen to find an issue on which he can agree with President Donald Trump, was convening a meeting to ""discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"".Until recently, Google has largely avoided the criticism over the handling of free speech and abusive content that has been directed at Twitter and Facebook. Now, with President Trump accusing it of bias in its search algorithm and senators on the warpath over their declined invitation, the company could find that US regulators are keen to follow the lead of the EU in examining its alleged anti-competitive practices,Also on this week's Tech Tent we meet the women trying to show that female tech entrepreneurs can thrive in Berlin.And actor or algorithm - is a computer-generated Donald Trump more convincing than a human impersonator? Listen in and find out."
technology	Microsoft seeks to clean up Xbox game chat with AI	Trash talk	"Microsoft is turning to AI and machine learning to let Xbox gamers filter the language they see in text messages.It is introducing customisable filters that let gamers choose the vocabulary they see in messages from friends and rival players.The four levels of filtering range from child-friendly through to entirely unfiltered.Initially the filters cover just text but will eventually apply to voice chat as well.In a blog, Microsoft said the filters would be trialled with Xbox testers in October and then rolled out to all users of its console later in the year.Players will be able to decide what level of filtering they want to apply to their interactions with friends or people they take on in games, it said.Once applied, filters will also apply to Xbox apps on Windows 10 and smartphones as well as the Xbox Game Bar.Microsoft has introduced four levels of filters - friendly, medium, mature and unfiltered. A warning saying ""potentially offensive hidden message"" will appear on filtered messages.The ""friendly"" setting will be applied by default to all child accounts on Xbox. It screens out all vocabulary that could be offensive.The ""medium"" setting will let some robust language through, explained Larry Hyrb, director of programming for Xbox Live, in a video.""Once you have applied the medium filter you'll notice that you'll still be able to see things like friendly trash talk between friends but vulgar words that we know are intended to bully or discriminate will be filtered out of your gaming experience,"" he said.Microsoft's ""mature"" rating covers text and messages that are almost always harmful to those who receive them, he added. Gamers can set different levels of filtering for friends and non-friends.The filtering system should be seen as an adjunct to Microsoft's existing community standards that encourage good behaviour while gaming, it said, adding that players should still report people who exhibited bad behaviour.Speaking to tech news site The Verge, Rob Smith, a program manager on Xbox Live's engineering team, said it was looking at developing systems that measure ""toxicity"" in online chat that can automatically mute people who are abusing friends and foes.This system could feed into the Xbox player reputation system where a bad rating can get players banned.Microsoft's work comes against a background of efforts by many other games firms to curb toxic behaviour - many of these systems have struggled to understand the context in which remarks are made and others have struggled with the slang used by certain groups.Studies have shown that the problem of abuse is widespread among gamers. An Anti-Defamation League study released in late July found that 74% of online players said they had experienced harassment of one form or another.More than half of the respondents to the ADL study said the abuse was based on ""race, religion, ability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or ethnicity""."
technology	Tech Tent - Facebook and Google’s hardware challenge		"They've built two of the world's most powerful and wealthy businesses on the back of their software expertise but this week Facebook and Google unveiled hardware products. On Tech Tent we ask whether the two Silicon Valley giants can persuade consumers to pay for devices when they are used to getting their services for free.When Facebook unveiled its Portal video chat screen, whose camera follows you around the room, the first reaction of many people - including me - was ""Really?!""If you've read Dave Eggers' novel The Circle about a social media business which wants its users to share everything about their lives - ""sharing is caring"" - Portal will sound like the ultimate realisation of that nightmare vision.Coming so soon after Facebook's latest data breach, it might seem the worst possible time to launch what is, in effect, a listening and viewing device for the home.But Andrew Bosworth, the executive running Facebook's hardware division, tells us the company understands the challenge: ""From the very beginning we knew that [when] introducing a new product category into people's homes you have to put privacy first.""He points to the cover for the camera when it is not in use, and to the fact that any data is processed locally on the device, rather than being sent off to Facebook's servers.Pressed on whether Portal users will end up seeing marketing messages he insists that isn't part of the plan: ""We have no plans to add advertising to this and we have no ambition to make money on this piece of hardware right now.""Which kind of begs the question - what is it for? Will the kind of people who currently use Skype or Apple's FaceTime to keep in touch with family and friends really want a separate screen that does much less than a smartphone or tablet?Patrick Spence, chief executive of smart speaker firm Sonos, is dubious.""People are getting a bit of screen fatigue,"" he tells us, believing that we are looking for something that makes our TVs, tablets and phones talk to each other better rather than adding yet another screen.Similar questions about privacy and usability hovered over the week's other hardware launch. Fresh from shutting down its social network Google+ after discovering a security vulnerability, the search giant unveiled its latest Pixel smartphones and the Google Home hub.This takes the Google Home smart speaker and gives it a screen but, unlike Facebook's Portal, no camera. And once more the company looks to be playing catch-up with Amazon, whose Echo Show and Spot devices have been out for a while.Perhaps more important to Google as a vehicle to show off its Android platform is the latest version of its Pixel smartphone. The first two won rave reviews, in particular for the camera, but negligible sales - by one measure it has got under 0.2% of the smartphone market.Now the Pixel 3 promises even better photos, but apart from an ugly notch on the XL model, it will look like any other smartphone to the casual observer - yet it has a price tag which puts it at the luxury end of the market. So don't be surprised if, yet again, the Pixel ends up as an also-ran in the smartphone stakes.Google has always had a dilemma - it wants to show it can make a compelling device but has to be careful not to antagonise giants like Samsung and Huawei which are vital for the health of the Android platform.Setting the right price, dealing with a global supply chain, getting the right marketing messages to customers are all essential skills for firms making consumer devices - not so much in building a search engine or a social network. Both Facebook and Google are finding that hardware is, well, hard."
technology	Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?		"If you believe crypto-currencies are the future this has not been a good week. The value of Ethereum, Bitcoin's main rival and ""the future of crypto"" not so long ago, has lurched ever lower and is now 80% below its peak.Meanwhile, US regulators have acted against companies involved in crypto-currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) - schemes to create new coins.But hope springs eternal, and in recent days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted me about plans to allow their customers to pay with crypto-currencies.So on this week's Tech Tent we debate this question: has crypto-currency peaked or do its best days lie ahead?We invited David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, a very sceptical take on the crypto landscape, to debate with Christopher Shake, the director of that London gallery, The House of Fine Art.The gallery's press release had boasted that it was about to run ""the very first art exhibition only available through crypto-currency"".By the time Mr Shake arrived in our studio that had changed slightly - customers would be encouraged to buy the 500 works in the October exhibition in Bitcoin or a range of other digital currencies but if they wanted to use good old-fashioned dollars or pounds, such payment would be accepted.""Our main goal is to support and promote our artists,"" he says. But as a crypto-currency enthusiast, he explains that there is also problem he wants to solve: people sitting on big crypto assets aren't able to spend them.""If a lot of merchants do jump on and accept crypto-currencies, that will add confidence to the market,"" he explains.But David Gerard says things are moving in the opposite direction - fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies because they are so volatile and the promise of smooth cost-free transactions has proved illusory.He says many left during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. ""You couldn't trust it for volatility, you couldn't trust it because transactions were slow and often didn't go through at all. It really destroyed the use-case for the general merchant acceptance of cryptos.""He sums up his view of the whole crypto market: ""It's not really very interesting or shiny any more.""But Christopher Shake sees it very differently. He claims that everyone from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook is now moving into crypto-currencies - something David Gerard says just isn't the case - and he believes it is an idea whose time has come.""It is sticking around because it has value. It's sticking around because it's a great technology, and that's why institutions are getting into it.""But for all his reservations, David Gerard does not expect Bitcoin in particular to disappear in a hurry. ""Bitcoin has spent its entire existence lurching from crisis to crisis, any of which would have killed a sane financial instrument,"" he says. ""But Bitcoin is more of a strong cultist advocate thing for people who are into it.""His forecast is that crypto-currency will slowly become more regulated and normalised - a rather different vision from that of the early Bitcoin advocates, who saw it smashing the system and making central banks and governments irrelevant.Also on this programme, we look at Apple's new health-focused Watch and ask whether doctors will be flooded with patients worried about what its ECG monitor is telling them. And we get two opposing views on whether the EU's proposed new copyright law is good for artists or will lead to a censored internet."
technology	Femtech: Right time, wrong term?	Femtech and fertility	"The meteoric rise of the label ""femtech"" to describe technology products, apps and hardware addressing women's health and wellbeing issues divides opinion.While some say it helps the sector secure vital funding from male-dominated venture capitalists, others argue that it unnecessarily pigeonholes women's health.So, does it help or hinder?I'm sitting in a trendy meeting room in central London, holding in my palm a little device that looks like a pale green egg with a tail.It's a smart pelvic-floor trainer from Elvie - a vaginal device that syncs with an app via Bluetooth, so you can follow work-outs on your phone.The start-up's chief executive, Tania Boler, reels off a list - which will be familiar to many women - of all the things that can go wrong if you lack a strong pelvic floor.""I mean, one in three women deal with bladder problems,"" she says.And then, she adds, there's ""prolapse problems, lower-back problems, sex problems...""I shift a little in my chair.The British start-up has become a poster child for the rise of femtech.From period trackers to breast pumps, the term encompasses menstruation, menopause, pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility - one often-quoted report predicts femtech could become a $50bn (£40bn) industry by 2025.You could argue: what's taken so long?And $50bn sounds like a lot. But when you consider that it's a sector that, in theory, targets almost four billion women - roughly half the world's population - suddenly it seems quite modest.Facebook alone, for example, has a membership of just over two billion people and is worth more than 10 times that figure.""I think in the future when historians look back, it will seem crazy that until [recently] there had never been a technology term for women,"" says Ms Boler.Femtech has only caught on as a term in the past few years. And not everyone is convinced it will be beneficial in the long run.Suw Charman-Anderson is the founder of Ada Lovelace Day. It marks its 10th anniversary this Tuesday and commemorates the woman who many consider to be the world's first computer programmer, as well as celebrating others who have been successful in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths).She fears femtech could become a double-edged sword.""If it evolves into just being tech, that's fine,"" she says.""It only becomes a problem if it becomes something that only female VCs [venture capitalists] invest in, that only female entrepreneurs work on, that only women buy.""But Ms Boler is convinced the term opens up opportunities - not to mention purse strings.""People thought we were completely crazy. I mean, this is an intimate device,"" she says, recalling the early days.""And obviously, we're mostly pitching to male investors. And it's a women's health issue that nobody talks about. So everybody said, this is going to be impossible - you'll never get celebrities to talk about this. You'll never get it into retail.""Well, you can now get the trainer in department stores, and Elvie's other product, a silent wearable breast-milk pump, made it into the 2019 Oscars' swag bag.In her book Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez recounts the story of Janica Alvarez, who was seeking funding for a breast-pump device in 2013.""I'm not touching that; that's disgusting,"" she was told by a male investor.Would the word ""femtech"" have broken down that barrier?While Ms Boler is enthusiastically on-message about the femtech brand and has certainly benefited from it - Elvie has raised $42m this year - she does also have some reservations.""In an ideal world, we wouldn't need femtech because 51% of the UK population is women,"" she points out. ""It's definitely not niche.""Critics of femtech also cite the inclusion of fertility issues under its brand as a problem.According to the NHS, one in seven couples face fertility problems. And while 25% of issues remain undiagnosed, the cause can lie with either men or women.""If you're looking at having babies and helping people figure it out, then that is not just a female problem, it's a family problem,"" says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Strategies.""Why should it just be labelled a female solution?""""To be honest with you, just saying femtech makes me cringe a little bit,"" she adds.""When it's about men and men's health, it's not mentech, right?""Melanie Hayes is an investor whose firm, Bethnal Green Ventures, avoids the term.""My biggest concern with femtech as a label is that it is used for people to say, 'Oh, I don't do that',"" she explains.Ms Hayes cites an example of one of her own recent investments - a social network that helps people in casual work source better working conditions, pay and flexibility around commitments such as caring and childcare.""While those kind of products are not femtech, and were certainly never pitched to us in that way, we can't ignore the fact that the users of the services that benefit disproportionately are likely to be women, because they are most affected by those issues,"" she says.""I'm really interested in technologies that are around healthy lives, a fairer society, and a more sustainable planet. I think femtech could easily touch on each of those things."""
technology	Passport facial recognition checks fail to work with dark skin		"When it launched a new passport checking service, the Home Office knew that it had trouble handling some shades of skin, a report in the New Scientist has revealed.The facial recognition technology failed to recognise the features of some people with very light or dark skin.The problem had become apparent during trials of the service.The government says that users can override the automated check if needed.Facial recognition maps a person's features from a computer-scanned image or live feed.The results are then compared against a database containing previously created facial maps to find a match.Documents released as a part of a freedom of information (FOI) request acknowledge that the Home Office knew its system had trouble mapping the faces of some ethnic minorities.It was aware of the problem but decided to launch the service regardless.""User research was carried out with a wide range of ethnic groups and did identify that people with very light or very dark skin found it difficult to provide an acceptable passport photograph,"" the FOI response stated.""However, the overall performance was judged sufficient to deploy.""The Home Office told the BBC it wanted the process of uploading a passport application photo to be simple. It added it would try and improve the system.Other facial recognition and facial tracking systems are being developed to address the problem.This is not the first time the Passport Office's use facial recognition has been known to be problematic.The photograph of a young black man was recently rejected because it mistook his lips for an open mouth, according to the Evening Standard.As a result, Joshua Bada was told his application had been rejected because he needed to provide a plain expression and a closed mouth - something he had in fact done."
technology	New tech lets submarines 'email' planes		"A way for submerged submarines to communicate with planes has been developed by researchers at MIT.At present, it is difficult for planes to pick up underwater sonar signals because they reflect off the water's surface and rarely break through.The researchers found an extremely high-frequency radar could detect tiny ripples in water, created by an ordinary underwater speaker.This could let lost flight recorders and submarines communicate with planes.Submarines communicate using sonar waves, which travel well underwater but struggle to break through the surface.Planes communicate using radio signals that do not travel well in water.At present, submarines can surface to send messages - but this risks revealing their location. Sometimes, buoys are used to receive sonar signals and translate them into radio signals.""Trying to cross the air-water boundary with wireless signals has been an obstacle,"" said Fadel Adib, from the MIT Media Lab.The system developed at MIT uses an underwater speaker to aim sonar signals directly at the water's surface, creating tiny ripples only a few micrometres in height.These ripples can be detected by high-frequency radar above the water and decoded back into messages.The researchers tested the idea in a swimming pool and were able to successfully receive the underwater messages from above the surface.However, the system can take a long time to send a large amount of data - and it does not work when there are waves taller than 16cm (6in) in the water.""It can deal with calm days and deal with certain water disturbances. But... we need this to work on all days and all weathers,"" said Mr Adib.It is also a one-way system that does not let the plane send messages back to the submarine.The researchers hope to develop algorithms that can eliminate the ""noise"" of a wavy ocean and isolate the tiny ripples from the sonar messages.In future, it could help planes or drones detect the location of a submerged ""black box"" flight recorder."
technology	Bill Gates brandishes poo to showcase reinvented toilet tech	Deadly disease	"Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates had his hands full on-stage in Beijing on Tuesday, showing a jar of human faeces.The stunt was part of his speech at the Reinvented Toilet Expo event - a showcase for new toilet technologies.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has spent more than $200m on researching the field across the last seven years.Twenty cutting-edge sanitation products were on display, intended to destroy harmful bacteria and prevent disease.""I have to say, a decade ago I never imagined that I'd know so much about poop,"" Mr Gates joked at the conference. ""And I definitely never thought that Melinda would have to tell me to stop talking about toilets and faecal sludge at the dinner table.""The entrepreneur was helping to launch the three-day event in China - where leader Xi Jinping has made a so-called ""toilet revolution"" across the country a policy priority.The showcased products aim to revolutionise sanitation technology by operating off-grid to separate liquid and solid waste and remove harmful by-products.""It's no longer a question of if we can reinvent the toilet and other sanitation systems,"" he said. ""It's a question of how quickly this new category of off-grid solutions will scale.""The entrepreneur described the inventions on display as the ""most significant advances in sanitation in nearly 200 years"".The technology giant pointed out the jar of faeces beside him could contain ""as many as 200 trillion rotavirus... 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs"".According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 2.3 billion people around the world still don't have access to basic sanitation facilities.This can cause diseases like cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery which kill hundreds of thousands of people every year.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gates discussed the inequalities in sanitation access.""In rich countries we have sewers that take clean water in, flush some of the dirty water out, in almost all cases there's a treatment plant,"" he said.""As we have these newer cities with lots of less wealthy people in them, those sewers have not been built and in fact, it's not likely they ever will be, so the question is, could you do it? Could you process human waste without that sewer system?""The foundation has said they hope the reinvented toilet will first roll out in buildings like schools and apartment buildings, before costs gradually decline and they become affordable in households.""You're only going to pay hundreds of dollars for a toilet - if it's really fantastic maybe $500,"" Mr Gates told the BBC.""You're saving all the costs of the waters, the processing products, but we have to bring it down by almost a factor of 10 from what the models are like - but that's not atypical for new product markets.""On his trip, Mr Gates also appeared at the First China International Import Expo in Shanghai, at a time of tension between the US and China.The world's two largest economies have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war over tariffs for much of the year."
technology	Tech Tent: Hot gadgets, self-driving cars and a weird party at CES		"It is the show that tells you where technology is heading - and this week on Tech Tent we bring you all the hottest gadgets and the top trends from CES in Las Vegas.We find out about the interactive plank of wood that could be an interface for your smart home and the Japanese companion robot designed to make you fall in love with it.We discuss 5G, AI and voice-activated devices - and try to cut through the hype and work out what products unveiled here will have a lasting impact.We also go for a ride in a self-driving car with Arkady Volozh, founder of Russia's tech giant Yandex. His company, often seen as Russia's equivalent of Google, started its autonomous vehicle research programme just two years ago.But it is already operating a robot taxi service in Moscow and another Russian city, just as Google's Waymo division has begun a commercial ride sharing service in Phoenix, Arizona.The Yandex boss admits that Waymo is the leader when it comes to autonomous driving technology but as we make our way remarkably smoothly around the streets of Las Vegas, albeit with a safety driver ready to take over, he's proud of the progress his company has made.""It took us less than two years to put this car on real streets,"" he says.And he explains that while his first ride in an autonomous vehicle left him feeling that removing the safety driver would take a decade, he now thinks that his firm is ""almost ready"" to go completely driverless.Yandex and others pushing the idea that the driverless future is nearly here must first convince two important constituencies. Local governments will need to change the rules of the road and consumers will need to be convinced that the technology is safe.The ride sharing firm Lyft has been running an autonomous car service in Las Vegas during CES with two engineers on board to monitor things.Those who have used it report that the service is so efficient that it rapidly becomes boring - surely a good thing - though the BBC's Dave Lee noticed that the back seat became uncomfortably hot because underneath it sits a beefy computer that powers the autonomous driving technology.In recent years, CES has been a better place than the traditional motor shows to see the latest innovations from the car industry. It's certainly where you will encounter excited predictions of the imminent arrival of the autonomous era.Away from Las Vegas, however, I sense a more sceptical mood about self-driving cars, with last year's fatal accident involving an Uber vehicle raising all sorts of questions about how the technology can be rolled out responsibly.Our final Tech Tent item is about a very weird CES party held at a luxury villa once owned by boxer Mike Tyson.It was held by promoters of a tech trend that has been hyped to the heavens over the last couple of years - but which party guests struggled to explain as the wine flowed and live music filled the house.

technology	Tech Tent: Time for VR to face reality?	Also in this week's programme:	"Just a couple of years ago it seemed Virtual Reality (VR) was finally going to become an important feature in all of our lives.But on Tech Tent this week we ask whether it's time for the VR industry to get real - and admit that most people aren't yet ready to spend time in virtual worlds.Billions of dollars have been invested in VR by the likes of Sony, Facebook's Oculus division and HTC, whose Vive system was at one stage predicted to revive the ailing company's fortunes.But so far, sales of headsets have proved disappointing and I've yet to hear anyone rave about the VR game they were playing last night - it seems the revolution may have to be postponed again.But a Finnish start-up founded by refugees from Nokia thinks it knows what the problem is - virtual reality just isn't real enough. Varjo has developed a high-end headset promising human eye resolution and aimed at business users - it will be priced at an eye-popping level, somewhere between €5,000 (£4,400) and €10,000.When the Varjo team came into Tech Tent HQ, I got a demo and was impressed by the realism of the experience. I was first shown an artist's studio where you could almost smell the paint and breathe in the dust - it was captured by taking more than 2,000 photos.Then I was moved into an aircraft cockpit, again a very real representation and with more obvious applications as a training environment - because that's where Varjo thinks VR can thrive.""VR of today has been meant for gaming, taking you to different worlds, not for practical purposes,"" one of the firm's founders, Urho Konttori, tells us.He says plenty of companies are trying to use VR for training but are hampered by the fact that headsets are just too low resolution, so people soon get bored with the experience.We saw a prototype - Varjo aims to release its headset by the end of this year and is hoping for interest from the automotive, aerospace and architecture industries.It is realistic enough to know that far bigger companies will be racing to provide similar high-resolution experiences but is confident Varjo has a head start and some protection from imitators: ""We patented the hell out of everything we do,"" says Mr Konttori with a grin.Still, both Varjo and the wider VR industry have a lot to prove. As a new form of entertainment, virtual reality has proved about as enticing to consumers as 3D television. Perhaps like 3D printing it is destined to find a profitable niche in the workplace rather than at home.From Netflix to Amazon Prime Video to the BBC iPlayer, video streaming is becoming the new way we consume TV. But with video accounting for more than half of all internet traffic, we look at the environmental cost of streaming.And could digital IDs be the answer to getting essential services to people in developing countries whose birth may never have been registered?"
technology	Tech Tent: Should Twitter ban Infowars?	Also on the podcast this week:	"How long can Twitter hold out as the only major tech company still giving house room to Alex Jones and his conspiracy site Infowars?On Tech Tent this week we explore how social media firms are agonising over how to police their own platforms, as they try to balance free speech with growing pressure to shut down extremist voices.So far, Twitter has been the outlier in this debate, insisting that Alex Jones and his Infowars site have not broken its rules, and can therefore stay.""None of this is easy,"" Professor Jeff Jarvis tells us. The journalist and academic - who has been a vocal advocate for the way social media companies have opened up public debate - sympathises with the stance taken by Twitter's Chief Executive Jack Dorsey.""Dorsey has a point that if the heinous things are not happening on his platform, it makes it harder for him to act,"" adds Prof Jarvis.After we spoke, CNN published an investigation showing that Infowars had repeatedly tweeted links to videos that appeared to break Twitter's rules by - for instance - encouraging the harassment of young people who had survived the Parkland school shooting.The tweets in question were deleted following the article's publication - Twitter says this appears to have been done by someone with control over the account.We asked for an interview with Jack Dorsey, who spoke this week to Fox News's Sean Hannity. Twitter told us he was unavailable.When I suggest to Prof Jarvis that the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Google are having to come to terms with the fact that they are essentially media companies, he pushes back strongly.Twitter, he says, is Times Square not the New York Times - it's about conversation not content: ""Do we really expect someone to be there policing every conversation?""He also rejects the idea that the truth is losing on the likes of Facebook and Twitter, and accuses old media of a moral panic.""Take off your dystopian glasses,"" he says pointing to the fact that movements like #blacklivesmatter, #metoo and the gun control campaign by Parkland students owe their existence to social media.Another view is that the internet has facilitated the spread of views that were once seen as completely beyond the pale in most public forums, such as holocaust denial and white supremacy.But there are signs today that even the most extreme free speech sites have their limits.Social network Gab has become the destination of choice for those on the alt-right who have been banned from other sites.This week it acted to remove some posts containing extreme anti-Semitism. The move followed pressure from Microsoft whose Azure cloud service hosts the social network.Back in 1996, America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act gave websites some immunity from the kind of legal action old media firms face if they host defamatory or hateful content.But they are not immune from public pressure - or from tech giants concerned about their reputations."
technology	Xiaomi smartphone has 108 megapixel camera	Merged pixels	"Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has unveiled the world's first mainstream handset to feature a 108 megapixel camera.The extra high-resolution sensor was developed by Samsung, which has yet to feature it in its own products.The firms say the benefit is that it delivers ""extremely sharp photographs that are rich in detail"".However, one early test of the tech indicates that its images contain more digital distortions than those produced by lower-resolution smartphones.For now, the Mi CC9 Pro Premium has only been announced for the Chinese market, where the base model costs 2,799 yuan ($400; £310).But Xiaomi has said it will use the same component in the Mi Note 10, which will be launched on Wednesday and sold more widely.The firm is currently the world's fourth-bestselling smartphone vendor, according to research firm Canalys, with a market share of 9.1%.Its sales are rapidly growing in Europe and it has just announced its intention to expand into Japan in 2020.Until now, 100MP+ sensors have typically been the preserve of medium-format digital cameras, which can cost tens of thousands of pounds.Trying to squeeze lots of resolution into a smaller smartphone component runs the risk of increasing cross-talk, a phenomenon where the electrical activity of one pixel spills into its neighbours, as they are packed so closely together. This results in digital noise in the final image.In addition, since each pixel needs to be smaller than normal to fit into the same space, each receives less light, causing further problems in low-light conditions.Samsung's Isocell Plus sensor partly addresses these problems by being larger in size than most smartphone sensors.But its key innovation is that its pixels are arranged in groups of four, with each set sharing the same colour filter to detect red, green or blue light.By default, data from each group is merged together to mimic the behaviour of a larger pixel. This results in a 27 megapixel photo.But if there is enough light, the user can override the function to obtain a 108MP image. This is obtained via a software algorithm that remaps the pixels to simulate what would have been recorded, had they been arranged in the normal pattern.The design, however, is not without its issues.""Images from the Mi CC9 Pro Premium Edition showed more artifacts than our other top-scoring phones,"" said review site DXOMark, which was given early access to the new handset.It added that the phone delivered ""limited dynamic range compared to other top performers"", meaning it tends to capture less detail in the highlights and shadows.Users must also bear in mind that the 108MP shots will take up much more storage than normal and require more processing power to edit.However, the phone does also include other lower-resolution sensors on its rear for telephoto portrait, wide-angle landscape, and macro close-up shots - which helped DXOMark give it a high score.Xiaomi previously announced it would use the 108MP sensor in the Mi Mix Alpha, which was unveiled in September.But that handset was pitched as a luxury device with a 19,999 yuan ($2,856; £2,218) price tag, and is not due for release until December.One expert said the inclusion of the camera in the mass market Mi CC9 Pro and Mi Note 10 should help the phones stand out.""Mobile phone manufacturers will go to almost any length to turn people's heads, and this enormous megapixel camera is one way of grabbing attention,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.""That doesn't necessarily mean that you're always going to get the best picture in all conditions. But for many consumers, there's a perception that the bigger the number, the better the product."""
technology	Berlin tech start-ups flex their muscles		"I have just been on a tour of a couple of hot new tech companies. Each had motivational posters on the walls.One had a bring your dog to work policy. The other had kitchens with free food on every floor. Both featured groups of young people from many countries all conversing in English.This wasn't Silicon Valley but Berlin, which now seems ready to stake a claim to be one of Europe's top tech hubs.It lacks the scale of London. But you can sense the confidence in this city, which is now attracting talented tech types from across the world.Last time I visited, I found plenty of sparky start-ups but no real heavyweights. This time, the two companies I met seemed ready to take on the world.My first stop was at Zalando, an e-commerce operation that in just a decade has transformed the online fashion market in Germany and 16 other European countries.As I arrived, everyone was focused on Bread and Butter, the company's big annual fashion show to be held in the Berlin Arena over the weekend.Note that it is not ""Brot und Butter"" - like everything else in this business that prides itself on its multinational workforce it happens in English""Cheap, fun, dynamic,"" were the words that Zalando's head of partnerships, Ben Woerner, used to describe how the company was perceived by its customers.But its success is perhaps a marker of how undeveloped the German market was when it arrived.When I ask what gap it was trying to fill back in 2007, Mr Woerner tells me e-commerce was ""very different"" back then.Not really in the UK, I think, where companies such as Asos have a much longer heritage.Germans, however, still needed convincing that buying clothes online was a good idea.But today Zalando is a public company with a market capitalisation of $11bn (£8.5bn) and Berlin's most successful online business. Like everyone I meet here, Mr Woerner enthuses about the city's energetic vibe and living costs that are way below those of Silicon Valley or London.""If I were a founder today, Berlin would be top of the list as a location,"" he says.Just down the road, I find a young Austrian, Valentin Stalf, who decided Berlin was a great place to start a new kind of bank.He describes N26 as ""the first bank that people love to use"".It has an even steeper growth trajectory than that of Zalando.Just five years after it was founded, the app-based bank employs 550 staff and is adding 50 every month - some of who bring their dogs to work, in an office that feels a million miles away from a traditional finance environment.It now operates across the eurozone and is about to bring its service to the UK, Europe's centre of fintech innovation.What it offers - banking on a mobile phone, no branches, a simple cheap service - will not sound that revolutionary to many British consumers.Again, Mr Stalf admits that German conservatism about banking online was an advantage when he and his co-founder got started, encouraging them to go international fast.""We are now in 17 countries across Europe and I think Germany is the hardest market.""Most of the time, German consumers are more conservative when it comes to new ideas - especially in finance.""If Germany overall is conservative, Berlin does seem a place where people with radical ideas can flourish.""You have more role models,"" says Mr Stalf ""It's a great place to be.""Now N26 faces its biggest challenge, winning over British consumers who can already choose from the likes of Atom Bank and Monzo and may be hard to prise away from the mainstream banks, which are at last beginning to offer better mobile apps.Berlin is definitely flexing its muscles as a European tech hub to rival London and Paris - but, a note of caution.Following the UK's EU referendum vote in 2016, the Berlin city government launched a campaign to lure London companies to the German capital. It promised that it would provide an ideal post-Brexit environment.This week, I asked the Berlin Senate for details of the companies that had signalled their intentions to move.So far, I have had no response."
technology	Tech Tent: What was in Twitter's troll data dump?	Did any of this have an impact in changing votes?Also on this week's podcast:	"What can 10 million tweets tell us about how Twitter is used as a propaganda tool?On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we explore the lessons to be learned from the vast data dump released by the company.It is no secret that Twitter has been used in attempts to sway public opinion around the world.Most of the tweets exposed by Twitter came from Russia's Internet Research Agency, which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United States and intervene in the 2016 election on behalf of Donald Trump.Twitter had suspended the accounts in question months ago but it released a treasure trove of data as a tool for researchers and journalists.It gave advance access to the Atlantic Council think tank. Its digital forensic research lab took a close look at the techniques employed by the troll farms.Ben Nimmo led the effort and told me the data cache showed a gradual evolution from the early days, when most of the tweets were quite boring.""You could see them learning how to use social media,"" he explained.""Individual accounts started getting more edgy, more aggressive, and trying to be more funny. And the more they did that, the more they were getting audience response.""Posing as angry Americans, they responded to breaking news such as the San Bernardino shooting. They intervened on both sides of the gun control debate, trying to fan the flames of discord.Mr Nimmo said there appeared to be some sort of editorial figure in charge. Thousands of tweets would suddenly coalesce around a hashtag.""You could imagine the editorial meeting where someone said, 'Right lads, this is your hashtag and this is what you'll be posting.'""While most of the activity first revolved around Russian and then American politics, the Atlantic Council team did spot some tweets about the UK's EU membership referendum.On the day of the vote, nearly 1,100 tweets in the trove featured the hashtag #ReasonsToLeaveEU - popular with Leave campaigners.Not in the case of Brexit, says Ben Nimmo, given the fact that Russian tweets were such a tiny proportion of the total conversation during the campaign.He is more circumspect about the impact in the United States.On the day of the 2016 election, one Russian troll tweeted the false claim that the voting machines had been fixed to favour Hillary Clinton. That single tweet had 25,000 retweets on the day. That kind of activity by the trolls had gone on for months.""They probably had some impact but it's hard to measure it,"" said Mr Nimmo."
technology	Tech Tent: Why did Facebook falter?		"On Wednesday evening, Facebook issued what looked at first glance to be some pretty solid results. Revenues for the second quarter were up 42% on the previous year, monthly active users had risen by 11% to 2.23 billion, and the firm had made record profits.But the following day the shares opened almost 20% lower, wiping more than $120bn from the market capitalisation of Facebook - or as the BBC's business editor Simon Jack put it, a ""shocking piece of value destruction"".On this week's Tech Tent we ask whether this was just a blip or represents the moment the air came out of the tech bubble. This year the Faangs - as investors have come to describe Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - have marched ever higher underpinning the whole stock market.But any failure to meet the extraordinarily inflated expectations of stellar growth can send shares tumbling - as Netflix found last week when its subscriber numbers were not quite as good as the market had hoped.What troubled investors in Facebook was not just that the results came in a tiny bit lower than expected, but that the company warned of more modest growth and profit margins in the coming months.Now Facebook has been warning for a while that the cost of dealing with various privacy scandals was going to affect its bottom line as it recruited more staff - and the figure showed its workforce increased by nearly a half over the last year. But somehow it still came as a shock to investors when what had been predicted came to pass.There are reasons to be cautious about Facebook's future growth - after all just about everybody in the United States and Europe who wants to use its service is probably already on board.But let's put this in context - even after Thursday's dramatic tumble, Facebook's share price was only back down to the level of early May, when it was climbing out of the slump caused by the Cambridge Analytica revelations.More evidence today that when it comes to news about social media audiences, the market just can't handle the truth. Twitter shares are tumbling after its latest results showed monthly users falling by one million to 335 million. But the company said that was partly due to its drive to get rid of fake accounts - a story it has been talking about for weeks.Now bots, spammers and other phony accounts are damaging in the long term to any platform which is telling advertisers it is a good safe home for their messages. But it seems that investors don't mind if millions of Twitter accounts are fake as long as the overall number keeps rising."
technology	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare faces Russian backlash	UrkistanA hit with criticsRussian backlash	"The latest Call of Duty game has been hit by thousands of negative reviews over its portrayal of Russia.The 16th major title in the series has largely been praised by critics.But Russian media and users on the review site Metacritic claimed the game was trying to rewrite history and promote anti-Russian propaganda.A spokesman for Activision Blizzard declined to comment on the user reviews but the company said the storylines were fictional.In a recent blog, the company said the game did not represent real-world events.Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare was released last week.The controversy surrounding the latest title stems from its Highway of Death mission.Players take on Russian snipers along a battered highway in the fictional country of Urkistan.However, some reviewers, including many writing in Russian, have noted similarities between the fictional road and a real-life thoroughfare that links Iraq and Kuwait.Highway 80, which connects the Iraqi city of Basra with Al Jahra in Kuwait, was dubbed the ""Highway of Death"" at the end of the Gulf War in the 1990s.In February 1991, US-led troops attacked Iraqi soldiers, leaving hundreds dead.One reviewer on the Metacritic website said the game was ""demonising Russia"", while another said it pitted ""bad Russians"" against ""good Americans"".A third user said: ""The game has good graphics. But the plot is disgusting propaganda and lies.""Critics have given the game a score of 85 out of 100 on Metacritic.However, hundreds of zero-score reviews have dragged down Modern Warfare's user-generated score to 3.2 out of 10 on the most popular Playstation 4 (PS4) platform.In total, there are more than 4,000 negative reviews from gamers playing on a PC, PS4 or Xbox, compared with just over 1,500 positive reviews.Russian media have also criticised the latest Call of Duty game.Maria Kornienko from the BBC's Monitoring service said state TV Rossiya 24 had released a four-minute report criticising Call of Duty.While the reaction among the gaming community has been mixed, top Russian video blogger Ilya Maddyson has branded the game ""too much"" on Twitter.He called for other Russian gamers to ""boycott it and show some respect for themselves"".Activision Blizzard has already faced controversy for punishing an e-sports competitor who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests at another game's event."
technology	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare arrives amid China controversy	Anti-government protestFirst look at Modern WarfareMobile hit	"The latest Call Of Duty (CoD) game has been released, amid calls to boycott its publisher's products.Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is the sixteenth major title in the series, which is one of the best-selling games franchises of all time.Activision Blizzard has faced criticism for punishing an e-sports competitor who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests at another game's event.Some fans said they had cancelled their pre-orders of CoD as a consequence.But industry watchers still expect the title to be one of the year's biggest earners.""Call of Duty remains Activision's biggest AAA [large budget] game franchise and is key to the company's annual performance and overall commercial targets,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at the IHS Markit consultancy.On 8 October, Chinese professional gamer Ng Wai Chung staged his protest during the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament, which is run by the firm's Blizzard division.The gamer, known as Blitzchung, put on a gas mask during a livestreamed interview and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.""The company said he would be banned for 12 months for breaking tournament rules, which say players must not offend people or damage its image.The gamer was also told he would not receive his prize money.After experiencing a backlash from other gamers, the company partially reversed the decision, allowing Blitzchung to get the money and halving the duration of the ban.But a bi-partisan group of US politicians subsequently wrote to Activision Blizzard's chief executive to express their ""deep concern"".""Because your company is such a pillar of the gaming industry, your disappointing decision could have a chilling effect on gamers who seek to use their platform to promote human rights and basic freedoms,"" they wrote.by Marc Cieslak, BBC ClickWarning: minor spoilers ahead!In an effort to rediscover the Call Of Duty mojo, publisher Activision is rebooting - or in this case reimagining - one of the series' high points: Modern Warfare.The game begins with a pre-title sequence worthy of movies like Sicario. It depicts the opening stages of a terrorist attack complete with a title card styled to look and feel like a serious thriller, rather than a slice of light entertainment.While the outfits have changed over the years to reflect the military fashion sense of each game's setting, the essentials of the first-person shooter gameplay have remained the same.In campaign mode, the player makes use of variety of weapons to eliminate enemies, and assumes the roles of soldiers from a host of different countries. In that respect, this is vintage Call of Duty.The story revolves around recovering chemical weapons stolen from a fictional country: Urzikistan.But early on, the action shifts to London in a mission that is surprising in its brutality.The sight of terrorists in suicide vests in Piccadilly Circus will no doubt prove to be controversial in the UK.Overall the tone is dark, using events inspired by reporting from the real world. A mass execution forming background action in one early mission reinforces that feeling.That, combined with using objects such a breeze block as a weapon, makes for a campaign that sometimes feels like this title might be trying a little too hard to be edgy.At this stage it is almost pointless talking about how well this game plays. Any developer producing AAA titles should be able to churn out a creditable first-person shooter.Fan favourite features in the campaign mode are all present and correct: there's a cinematic feel to proceedings and the player almost has the sense of participating in an interactive movie, where the action will only progress once they have achieved certain objectives or overcome enemies.The weapons feel precise, the action forces you to make each shot count and use cover cleverly and often, but this is what any veteran first-person shooter (FPS) player expects.It's the polish and the sky-high production values that separate Call Of Duty from the pack.On this front Modern Warfare delivers. It feels like a return to and extension of the universe created in the original trilogy rather a rehash or remake.But wherever Call Of Duty goes, controversy is often not far behind. The allusion to real-world events - terrorist atrocities at major landmarks, wars in Middle Eastern countries - doesn't always sit well with the series' action-movie aesthetic.The game's developers have told me they want the player to think about some of the issues the title raises.This notion is perhaps one that few people would question, were this a movie rather than a video game.I just wonder how effective a tool of reflection and education on contemporary conflict this experience can be, in a game where the primary activity is shooting stuff.Following criticism over the use of loot boxes in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4, the new Modern Warfare game will instead use a Battle Pass system, similar to the hit game Fortnite.However, PlayStation-maker Sony has decided not to release Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare on its online store in Russia.According to news site Eurogamer, one level depicts a young girl called Farah who gets caught up in a Russian bombing campaign.In a statement, Activision said: ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a fictional game that has been thoughtfully created to entertain fans and tell a compelling narrative.""Sony Interactive Entertainment has decided not to sell Modern Warfare on the PlayStation Store in Russia at this time. We look forward to launching Modern Warfare digitally in Russia on 25 October on PC and on console via Xbox.""There had been some ""consumer fatigue [in CoD] over the last few years"", said Mr Harding-Rolls.""However, Activision is busy diversifying the franchise onto other platforms, especially mobile where Call of Duty Mobile has had one of the strongest openings of a game app ever.""As such, the franchise is being exposed to a much broader audience and that may help support sales of the AAA version.""The mobile version of Call Of Duty, released on 1 October, and was downloaded more than 100 million times in a week, breaking records."
technology	Go master quits because AI 'cannot be defeated'	Challenging	"A master player of the Chinese strategy game Go has decided to retire, due to the rise of artificial intelligence that ""cannot be defeated"".Lee Se-dol is the only human to ever beat the AlphaGo software developed by Google's sister company Deepmind.In 2016, he took part in a five-match showdown against AlphaGo, losing four times but beating the computer once.The South Korean said he had decided to retire after realising: ""I'm not at the top even if I become the number one.""""There is an entity that cannot be defeated,"" the 18-time world Go champion told South Korea's Yonhap news agency.Lee Se-dol is considered to be one of the greatest Go players of the modern era.The 36-year-old former world champion started playing at the age of five, and turned pro just seven years later.His defeat by the AlphaGo software was seen as a landmark moment for artificial intelligence.AlphaGo was developed by Deepmind, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet.""On behalf of the whole AlphaGo team at DeepMind, I'd like to congratulate Lee Se-dol for his legendary decade at the top of the game, and wish him the very best for the future,"" said Demis Hassabis, chief executive and co-founder of Deepmind.""During the AlphaGo matches, he demonstrated true warrior spirit and kept us on the edges of our seats to the very end.""Go originated in China 3,000 years ago, and has been played for centuries.Two players take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by taking control of the most territory on the board.The board game is considered to be a much more complex challenge for a computer than chess.A player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess - and there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to researchers.It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.Deepmind hopes that the development of AlphaGo will lead to ""similar techniques"" that can be ""applied to other structured problems, such as protein folding, reducing energy consumption or searching for revolutionary new materials"".Despite his retirement, Lee Se-dol is due to play against another AI system in December.He will play against HanDol, a program developed by South Korea's NHN Entertainment Corp, which has already defeated the country's top five Go players.Lee will be given an advantage of two stones in the first game, but suspects he will lose.""Even with a two-stone advantage, I feel like I will lose the first game to HanDol. These days, I don't follow Go news. I wanted to play comfortably against HanDol as I have already retired, though I will do my best,"" he said."
technology	World of Warcraft Classic: Hit game goes back to basics	What set WoW apart?Why do some fans want Classic?Will Classic endure?	"The hit video game World of Warcraft (WoW) is going back to basics with the launch of WoW Classic this evening.First released in 2004, the online multi-player game has evolved and changed dramatically over the years.Many players had asked developer Blizzard Entertainment to revive the original version of the game, known as ""classic"" or ""vanilla"" WoW.While not identical to the original, WoW Classic will replicate a majority of the features from the first game.World of Warcraft is a fantasy game in which players roam the virtual world, fighting monsters and completing quests.Blizzard said some players who had been given early access to the classic version - which is released at 23:00 BST on Monday - mistakenly thought some of the original features were errors.The company has compiled a list of common complaints that are ""not bugs"" on its message board.""WoW's launch was a significant moment,"" says Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS Markit consultancy. ""It had a broad impact on the gaming sector as a whole and especially the online gaming scene.""The appeal and accessibility of the game meant it soon grew to millions of users in the West and broadened the audience for this type of game significantly.""It was so popular in the US that Blizzard - then part of Vivendi - ran ads on TV with celebrity endorsements. This was pretty much unheard of back in 2004.""Oli Walsh, editor of video-game website Eurogamer, said: ""The quality of the execution set it apart, along with Blizzard's ability to make this previously rather intimidating style of game approachable to a broad audience.""It was, and remains, so well done that nothing has really supplanted it in 15 years - although many tried. Arguably, it was the first truly mass-market online game.""Luciano Frias-Andrade, who has played WoW since it was released in the UK in 2005, said the game had evolved considerably.""Back then it was a very different world, with no short cuts. I remember spending a day 'walking' by foot from the human capital to the elven home town, just to be the first human there,"" he told the BBC. ""When I arrived, it caused a sensation. Everyone said: 'A human, here? How?'""He fondly remembers a bug that affected gameplay back in 2005, now known as the corrupted blood incident.""One of the high-level bosses had a spell that damaged high-level players. Problem was, it was infectious and the programmers didn't count on players warping back home.""The capital cities were littered with dead players and skeletons, because it instantly killed low-level players. They would respawn and instantly die again. It was like a real virus until the developers fixed it.""He told the BBC he was not sure whether he would commit to playing Classic long term.""I'll give Classic a go, but honestly, it took for ever to do anything. I'm not sure if I'd have the time.Another long-term fan, Valen Kross, agreed.""When WoW started it was a great game for its time. But it was a massive time sink - much more than it is now. I just don't want to put in all that time,"" he said.""The main reason why I play WoW is the rich lore of of the world. Story is the most important thing to me, so playing the vanilla game is essentially a time bubble, in which the story can't go anywhere.""But Aaron McConnell, who plays as Typhane in the Maelstrom realm, is more excited.""It's an entirely different game right now, compared to when it first launched,"" he said.""The scale of things added over the years is too much to put into words. Classic is worth its own game outright. I'm definitely going to play it. It's a huge change of pace.""At its peak, World of Warcraft had about 12 million active players, though numbers have since declined.However, Blizzard expects so much interest in WoW Classic that players will have to queue to enter certain realms.One of the game's producers has encouraged fans to reserve their player name ahead of the launch.""The release of WoW Classic will be a nostalgia trip for gamers who left WoW many years ago - and a fresh experience for gamers that played the game later in its lifecycle,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls.""Inevitably there will be some aspects of WoW Classic that might feel of its time, but it has also been updated with better graphics and other features to make the transition easier for gamers in 2019.""Another online title - Runescape - did something similar.Mr Walsh suggested that many gamers may not take long to tire of the latest revival.""I think a lot of people will enjoy reliving memories in it for a month or two, but after a while they'll move on and only that hardcore will remain,"" he said.""For Blizzard, it's more of a vehicle to keep WoW fresh and get lapsed players excited about it.""It's significant in another sense, though - this is [one of the few times] anyone has officially recreated an old version of an evolving online game, and as such, it's a fascinating experiment."""
technology	Spying tools website taken down after UK raids	'Serious criminality'Crime as a service	"A website selling hacking tools that let attackers take over victims' computers has been closed down after an international investigation.The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said 14,500 people had bought spying tools from the Imminent Methods site.Police searched more than 80 properties across the world to find those selling the tools.They were also able to trace people who had bought the software and charge them with computer misuse offences.Imminent Methods sold a tool known as the Imminent Monitor Remote Access Trojan (Imrat) for about $25 (£19).It gave the attacker full access to an infected device, letting them steal data, monitor what the victim was doing and even access their webcam.The NCA said properties in Hull, Leeds, London, Manchester, Merseyside, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Somerset and Surrey were among those searched.The international operation was led by the Australian Federal Police.The authorities were able to take down the website selling the software, which subsequently stopped the cyber-stalking tools from working.The NCA's Phil Larratt said the tools had been used ""to commit serious criminality"" including ""fraud, theft and voyeurism"".Police said 14 people had been arrested worldwide in connection with the sale and use of the software.By seizing control of the website, police will have been able to ""take a good look at what the site has been up to, including who has bought the illegal items"", said Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert from the University of Surrey.""The authorities now know how many users bought the malware on offer. They will now be working to unmask the 14,500 who were daft enough to buy this malware.""""Organised crime gangs, as well as more petty criminals, are switching their attention to cyber-crime rather than, say, drugs, because it is perceived there will be a significant return on their investment and much lower risk,"" said Prof Woodward.He said in addition to selling hacking tools, criminals also provide access to the infrastructure to power their malware, including so-called bulletproof hosting.""They set themselves up in jurisdictions and in such a technical manner that they think they are untouchable by law enforcement agencies in the countries where their clients conduct their crimes,"" he told the BBC.""All of the above is called crime as a service, and has been a significant trend in recent years."""
technology	Cerebras reveals world's 'largest computer chip' for AI tasks	Why is the development important?What are the disadvantages?Is this the first AI-chip?	"A Californian-based start-up has unveiled what it says is the world's largest computer chip.The Wafer Scale Engine, designed by Cerebras Systems, is slightly bigger than a standard iPad.The firm says a single chip can drive complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems in everything from driverless cars to surveillance software.However, one expert suggested that the innovation would prove impractical to install in many data centres.Computer chips have generally become smaller and faster over the years.Dozens are typically manufactured on a single silicon ""wafer"", which is then cut apart to separate them from each other.The most powerful desktop CPUs (central processing units) have about 30 processor cores - each able to handle their own set of calculations simultaneously.GPUs (graphics processing units) tend to have more cores, albeit less powerful ones.This has traditionally made them the preferred option for artificial intelligence processes that can be broken down into several parts and run simultaneously, where the outcome of any one calculation does not determine the input of another.Examples include speech recognition, image processing and pattern matching. The most powerful GPUs have as many as 5,000 cores.But Cerebras' new chip has 400,000 cores, all linked to each other by high-bandwidth connections.The firm suggests this gives it an advantage at handling complex machine learning challenges with less lag and lower power requirements than combinations of the other options.Cerebras claims the Wafer Scale Engine will reduce the time it takes to process some complex data from months to minutes.Its founder and chief executive Andrew Feldman said the company had ""overcome decades-old technical challenges"" that had limited chip size.""Reducing training time removes a major bottleneck to industry-wide progress,"" he said.Cerebras has started shipping the hardware to a small number of customers.It has not yet revealed how much the chips cost.While the chips process information much faster, Dr Ian Cutress, senior editor at the news site AnandTech, said the advances in technology would come at a cost.""One of the advantages of smaller computer chips is they use a lot less power and are easier to keep cool,"" he explained.""When you start to deal with bigger chips like this, companies need specialist infrastructure to support them, which will limit who can use it practically.""That's why it's suited for artificial intelligence development as that's where the big dollars are going at the moment.""Cerebras is far from the first company to develop chips to power AI systems.In 2016, Google developed TPU (tensor processing unit) chips to power software including its language translation app, and now sells the technology to third parties.The following year, China's Huawei announced that its smartphone Kirin chips had gained an NPU (neural processing unit) to help speed up the calculation of matrix multiplications - a type of mathematics commonly involved in AI tasks.But not all such efforts have been successful.In the early 1980s, the US company Trilogy received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to create its own super-chip.However, the processors got too hot in testing and were less powerful than initially thought.Plagued by technical and personal challenges, the company gave up on the project five years later."
technology	iPhone faces sales ban threat due to computer chip patent battle		"A legal battle between two chip firms could see some of the world's most popular gadgets removed from sale.Apple and Google's products are among those that may have to be taken off the shelves because of the patent dispute.US-based GlobalFoundries is demanding an import ban of products that use processors manufactured by its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in the US and Europe.TSMC has described the firm's claims as ""baseless"".GlobalFoundries claims its intellectual property has been used illegally in the iPhone XS and Pixel smartphones as well as other handsets.It says other companies that rely heavily on the disputed tech include Nvidia, Asus, Motorola and OnePlus.The company, which is based in California, is seeking ""significant"" damages, alleging that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had made billions of dollars of profit using its patented technology.GF wants to prevent the import of chips produced with the technologies in question.It says consumers would still have the option of buying alternative products from the likes of Samsung and LG, which are not named in the lawsuit.It said this means there would still be an adequate supply of consumer electronics.""These lawsuits are aimed at protecting those investments and the US and European-based innovation that powers them,"" said Gregg Bartlett, senior vice-president of engineering and technology at GF.""This action is critical to halt Taiwan Semiconductor's unlawful use of our vital assets and to safeguard the American and European manufacturing base.""TSMC said it intends to defend its business.""We are disappointed to see a foundry peer resort to meritless lawsuits instead of competing in the marketplace with technology,"" the company said in a statement.It added that it would ""fight vigorously and use any and all options to protect our proprietary technologies""."
technology	Computer password inventor dies aged 93	Small slices	"Computer pioneer Fernando Corbato, who first used passwords to protect user accounts, has died aged 93.Dr Corbato introduced the basic security measure while developing methods that let more people use a computer at the same time.He developed a technique, called time-sharing, that divided up the processing power of a computer so it could serve more than one person at once.Dr Corbato reportedly died as a result of complications caused by diabetes.The work on sharing a computer was done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where Dr Corbato spent his entire career.He joined MIT in 1950 to study for a doctorate in physics, but realised during those years that he was more interested in the machines that physicists used to do their calculations than in the subject itself.Using computers during the 50s was an exercise in frustration because the huge, monolithic machines could only handle one processing job at a time.In a bid to overcome this limitation, Dr Corbato developed an operating system for computers called the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS).Rather than have the machine dedicated to one person, CTSS divided up the processing power of a computer into small slices so it could do little bits of work for lots of people.Even in the 50s and 60s computers were so fast that no user noticed they were only getting a small portion of a machine's processing power at any one time.The development of CTSS led to another time-sharing programme called Multics, which was the forerunner of the Linux operating system and many other aspects of contemporary computing.Passwords were introduced to CTSS as a way for users to hide away the files and programs they were working on from others on the same machine.""Putting a password on for each individual user as a lock seemed like a very straightforward solution,"" Dr Corbato told Wired in 2012.In 1990, Dr Corbato received the AM Turing Award - one of the highest honours given to computer scientists - for his pioneering work on time-sharing systems.Prof Fadel Adib, from the Media Lab at MIT, paid tribute, saying: ""Our world would be very different without his research and that of his descendants. He inspires in his work and his legacy."""
technology	The tablet computer pulled by donkey	Frugal innovation	"Back in 2016, mobile technology the like of which had not been seen before rolled into the remote community of Funhalouro, in Mozambique.Pulled by donkey, the container consisted of four LCD screens, powered by solar panels.It was a mobile roadshow, starting with music to draw a crowd and then switching to a three-minute film on the biggest of the screens.While the topic - digital literacy - was not the most entertaining, it was engaging for the audience, many of whom had never seen a screen or moving images before.After the film, the audience was invited to use smaller touchscreen tablets to answer a series of questions about what they had seen.There were prizes of T-shirts and caps for those with the highest scores.For those who couldn't read, the questions were posed in diagram form.""When we arrive in a community, we try and make it a party,"" said Dayn Amade, founder of the Community Tablet.""We want to attract people and we do it with music.""Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have 634 million mobile users by 2025, up from 250 million at the end of 2017, according to GSM Association, the trade body for mobile carriers.Adoption of mobile technology has transformed lives, from providing people with a way to bank for the first time to helping farmers improve their crop yield.But some countries fare better than others.While in Kenya mobile penetration is at 91%, in Mozambique less than half of its 31 million population have mobile connections.The Community Tablet aims to fill this gap and the entertainment is just the precursor to the real point of the roadshow - to educate and empower remote and rural communities on a range of topics, from public health to mobile banking to why it is important to take part in elections.Mr Amade, who was born in Mozambique, got the idea as he watched his two young sons and saw how addicted to their tablets they were and how quickly they learned how to build things by watching YouTube tutorials.""I said to myself that this can be used in rural communities where people aren't able to do basic things because they have never had a tutorial,"" he said.There have been plenty of initiatives to increase the use of technology in countries such as Mozambique, often with patchy results.The One Laptop Per Child initiative, for instance, aimed to transform education but failed to deliver on its promises.""The reality of Africa means that experiments like One Laptop per child or other ways of distributing smartphones unfortunately for various reasons do not work out,"" said Mr Amade.""It's impossible to give a tablet to everybody - it is too expensive and you don't know if they are going to use it or are going to sell it.""Traditionally, educational material is passed on via community theatre or cinema.One blogger in Liberia used to painstakingly write out the news on a blackboard for those in his community without phones or access to newspapers, radio or TV.Sometimes, the simple ideas were the best, said Ken Banks, an innovator in mobile for Africa and head of social impact at digital ID company Yoti.""Projects like the Community Tablet are a great example of appropriate, almost frugal innovation - focusing on what works rather than what looks good,"" he said.""We have the ability to solve many development problems with tools available today - but often we're too busy chasing the next shiny innovation.""Mr Amade agrees his is a very simple solution, describing it as ""an adequate way of supplying digital education to people in rural communities"".""It is safe and robust. It cannot be broken and it cannot be stolen,"" he said.The project makes money from non-government organisations (NGOs), many of which have been trying to reach remote communities via more traditional methods, such as lecturers and handing out pamphlets.""If people get a pamphlet, they throw it away. And most people don't listen after two or three minutes,"" said Mr Amade.""NGOs go to these communities to solve specific problems but the problems remain because people have not understood. With our system, people listen, interact and then we test them.""Many of the projects have seen tangible results, according to Mr Amade:Mr Amade has been on the road for the past three years, visiting 90 communities in Mozambique's remotest areas.And he has learned lessons along the way, including how to adapt the technology to account for the country's potholed and dusty roads and how to alter content to suit specific communities.One animated video, explaining the importance of hygiene to prevent cholera, horrified one largely Muslim community because it showed someone wiping their bottom with their right hand, the same hand used to eat with.""I've made mistakes along the way and sometimes content can offend,"" Mr Amade said.Now, all content is shown to anthropologists and psychologists based at Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, a university in Maputo.""The use of anthropologists is very refreshing and a big part of the story,"" said Mr Banks.""Anthropology is ideally placed to help us understand local contexts, cultures, economics and geographies - yet many projects fail to engage them.""The Community Tablet has been granted a UK patent and Mr Amade is now looking to franchise it.He hopes to expand beyond Mozambique and to make inroads into more urban communities.Already, he is experimenting with using the system in schools to offer children careers advice.And for those who did not have the luxury of an education, the tablet could be an incredibly powerful tool, he said.""The reality of Mozambique is that the quality of education is extremely poor and that is why we remain poor because people are not being empowered properly,"" Mr Amade said.""By explaining to people and showing them, you can solve many problems, including the poverty we live in."""
technology	WhatsApp hack: Is any app or computer truly secure?	Was WhatsApp's encryption broken?What about back-ups?Should people stop using WhatsApp?Is any device ever safe?	"WhatsApp has confirmed that a security flaw in the app let attackers install spy software on their targets' smartphones.That has left many of its 1.5 billion users wondering how safe the ""simple and secure"" messaging app really is.On Wednesday, chip-maker Intel confirmed that new problems discovered with some of its processors could reveal secret information to attacks.How trustworthy are apps and devices?No. Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they are scrambled when they leave the sender's device. The messages can be decrypted by the recipient's device only.That means law enforcement, service providers and cyber-criminals cannot read any messages they intercept as they travel across the internet.However, there are some caveats.Messages can be read before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. That means any spyware dropped on the phone by an attacker could read the messages.On Tuesday, news site Bloomberg published an opinion article calling WhatsApp's encryption ""pointless"", given the security breach.However, that viewpoint has been widely ridiculed by cyber-security experts.""I don't think it's helpful to say end-to-end encryption is pointless just because a vulnerability is occasionally found,"" said Dr Jessica Barker from the cyber-security company Cygenta.""Encryption is a good thing that does offer us protection in most cases.""Cyber-security is often a game of cat and mouse.End-to-end encryption makes it much harder for attackers to read messages, even if they do eventually find a way to access some of them.WhatsApp gives the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but those back-up copies are not protected by the end-to-end encryption.An attacker could access old chats if they broke into a cloud storage account.Of course, even if users decide not to back up chats, the people they message may still upload a copy to their cloud storage.Ultimately, any app could contain a security vulnerability that leaves a phone open to attackers.WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which typically issues software fixes quickly.Of course, even large companies can make mistakes and Facebook has had its share of data and privacy breaches over the years.There is no guarantee a rival chat app would not experience a similar security lapse.At least, following the disclosure of this flaw, WhatsApp is slightly more secure than it was a week ago.Some rival chat apps are open-source projects, which means anybody can look at the code powering the app and suggest improvements.""Open-source software has its value in that it be can tested more widely but it doesn't necessarily mean it's more secure,"" said Dr Barker.""Vulnerabilities can still be found with any tech, so it's not the answer to our prayers.""And if someone did decide to switch to a rival chat app, they would still have to convince their contacts to do the same. A chat app without friends is not much use.In theory, any device or service could be hacked. In fact, security researchers often joyfully pile in on companies that claim their products are ""unhackable"".They quickly discover vulnerabilities and the embarrassed companies retract their claims.If people are worried data may be stolen from their computer, one option is to ""air gap"" the device: disconnect it from the internet entirely.That stops remote hackers accessing the machine - but even an air gap would not stop an attacker with physical access to the device.Dr Barker stressed the importance of installing software updates for apps and operating systems.""WhatsApp pushed out an update and consumers might not have realised that security fixes are often included in updates,"" she told BBC News.WhatsApp did not help the cause, however, by describing the latest update as adding ""full-size stickers"", and not mentioning the security breach.""People need to be made aware that updates are really important. The quicker we can update our apps, the more secure we are,"" said Dr Barker.As always, there are simple security steps to remember:"
technology	Computer virus alters cancer scan images		"A computer virus that can add fake tumours to medical scan images has been created by cyber-security researchers.In laboratory tests, the malware altered 70 images and managed to fool three radiologists into believing patients had cancer.The altered images also managed to trick automated screening systems.The team from Israel developed the malicious software to show how easy it is to get around security protections for diagnostic equipment.The program was able to convincingly add fake malignant growths to images of lungs taken by MRI and CT scanning machines.The researchers, from Ben Gurion University's cyber-security centre, said the malware could also remove actual malignant growths from image files to prevent patients who are targets getting the care they need.The images targeted were scans of lungs but the malware could be tuned to produce other fake conditions such as brain tumours, blood clots, fractures or spinal problems, according to the Washington Post, which first reported on the research.Images and scans were vulnerable, said the researchers, because the files were generally not digitally signed or encrypted. This means any changes would be hard to spot.The researchers suggested the security flaws could be exploited to sow doubt about the health of government figures, sabotage research, commit insurance fraud or as part of a terrorist attack.In addition, they said, weaknesses in the way hospitals and health care centres protect their networks could give attackers easy access.While hospitals were careful about sharing sensitive data beyond their boundaries, they took much less care when handling data internally, said one of the researchers.""What happens within the hospital system itself, which no regular person should have access to in general, they tend to be pretty lenient about,"" Yisroel Mirsky told the Washington Post.Better use of encryption and digital signatures could help hospitals avoid problems if cyber-attackers tried to subvert images, he added.Hospitals and other healthcare organisations have been a popular target for cyber-attackers and many have been hit by malicious ransomware that encrypts files and only returns the data when victims pay up.The NHS was hit hard in 2017 by the WannaCry ransomware which left many hospitals scrambling to recover data."
technology	Arron Banks' private messages leaked by hacker		"The Twitter account of Arron Banks, the founder of the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU, has been hacked.The perpetrator has leaked thousands of his private messages to and from dozens of other people spanning several years.In a statement, Mr Banks accused Twitter of taking too long to tackle the issue and said the social network had ""deliberately chosen"" to leave his personal information online.Twitter said it had ""taken steps to secure the compromised account"".""We will continue to take firm enforcement action in line with our policy which strictly prohibits the distribution on our service of materials obtained through hacking,"" Twitter said in a statement.It is not known who carried out the attack.The data was made available by the hackers in the form of a link to a download. The original file is no longer online.One expert said the hacker, if caught, could be prosecuted under the Computer Misuse Act, and that others who made use of the material would be walking into a legal minefield.""Even if Arron Banks was using Twitter in a private capacity rather than as Leave.EU, the data was misappropriated from Twitter and that likely engages the Data Protection Act,"" commented Tim Turner, a data protection consultant.""There are public interest defences for using unlawfully obtained data, but that requires a journalist or other person to gamble that they can successfully argue that the public interest supports whatever use they make of it.""You cannot know for certain that the public interest will back up any particular course of action; a person would have to act first, and see what follows.""Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed that it is investigating the matter.""We're investigating whether any offences have been committed under the Computer Misuse Act after we received a report a Twitter account was compromised,"" said a spokesman.In February 2019, Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by Mr Banks were fined £120,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office for breaching data protection laws.""Arron Banks has shown extraordinary contempt for the ICO and British data laws and so this is a moment for him to reflect on the need for those laws and a regulator to enforce them,"" said the journalist Carole Cadwalladr.Ms Cadwalladr and Mr Banks have had many battles over her investigations into his affairs.She said in a tweet that she had been sent some direct messages, said to be from the hacked account.They were ""pretty explosive"" she tweeted.Ms Cadwalladr told the BBC she had not downloaded any data.Mr Banks' Twitter account was suspended following the breach but is now working again."
technology	Dick Barnes, pioneer behind oldest working computer, dies	'Witch'	"One of the co-designers of a machine later recognised as the world's oldest working digital computer has died.Richard ""Dick"" Barnes helped to create the Harwell Dekatron, which was first put to use in 1951 by Britain's fledgling nuclear research establishment.He was also involved in the 2.5-tonne machine's restoration, which saw it switched back on in 2012.Mr Barnes died aged 98 on 8 April, The National Museum of Computing said.He and two colleagues, Ted Cooke-Yarborough and Gurney Thomas, began their work on the Harwell Dekatron in 1949.It was initially used by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire, where its tasks involved solving equations used to design the structure supporting the world's first commercial nuclear reactor at Calder Hall.In 1957, the computer was acquired by Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College.It was used to teach computing there for 16 years and earned the nickname ""Witch"", or ""Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computation from Harwell"".""All the early computer designers faced the problems of storing data, so we selected dekatrons, a ready-made storage device for one decimal digit,"" Mr Barnes said in 2012.Dekatrons were gas-filled tubes that were used as counting devices in some early digital computers. Rows of them could be used to store numbers in the computer's memory so that calculations could be carried out.In November 2012 the machine was successfully switched back on after a three-year restoration project.The revived machine functioned as planned, which is to say, very slowly.It could take up to 10 seconds to multiply two numbers - but Mr Barnes and his co-designers had wanted a machine that could run continuously, not necessarily quickly, in order to be useful.Indeed, it was known to calculate continuously for periods of up to 80 hours.Delwyn Holroyd, of the Harwell Dekatron restoration team, said Mr Barnes had taken ""a keen interest"" in the project.""Dick was responsible for the complex relay logic, which he designed on paper without the benefit of the tools we take for granted nowadays and with very little prior art to draw upon,"" he said.""The compactness, elegance and reliability of the resulting design is a fitting tribute to his skill."""
technology	Computer servers 'stranded' in space	Cooler air	"A pair of Hewlett Packard Enterprise servers sent up to the International Space Station in August 2017 as an experiment have still not come back to Earth, three months after their intended return.Together they make up the Spaceborne Computer, a Linux system that has supercomputer processing power.They were sent up to see how durable they would be in space with minimal specialist treatment.After 530 days, they are still working.Their return flight was postponed after a Russian rocket failed in October 2018.HPE senior content architect Adrian Kasbergen said they may return in June 2019 if there is space on a flight but ""right now they haven’t got a ticket"".The company is working with Nasa to be ""computer-ready"" for the first manned Mars flight, estimated to take place in about 2030. The company is also working with Elon Musk’s Space X.Currently, the 20-year-old machines controlling the ISS return data to Earth for processing. This is possible because it takes less than a second to get the data back.But on a Mars mission, the time taken for a data round-trip will grow to more than 40 minutes as the planet is millions of miles away. That means the data processing will have to be done on the spaceship.The three original computers on board the ISS had cost $8m each and taken 10 years to build, Mr Kasbergen told BBC News.“Our servers cost thousands, rather than millions of dollars,” he added, speaking at the 2019 Mobile World Congress (MWC), in Barcelona, where HPE is displaying a replica model of the ISS Destiny Module.The Spaceborne Computer is currently embedded in the ceiling of the real thing, Mr Kasbergen said.While the servers themselves were not modified, they did get a bespoke cooling solution.The servers were placed in an airtight box with a radiator that is hooked up to the ISS water-cooling system. Hot air from the computers is guided through the radiator to cool down and than circulated back.Mr Kasbergen said there had been problems with the redundancy power supply as well as some of the redundant solid-state drives.But he said the failures were handled by the autonomous management software that was part of the experiment.The devices will need to be inspected back on Earth to find out what went wrong."

technology	Apple unveils 16in MacBook Pro - with updated keyboard		"Apple has unveiled the latest version of its 16in MacBook Pro laptop computer - and it features a newly designed keyboard.The keyboards on some older MacBook Pros, which used an internal ""butterfly"" mechanism, had been described by some as uncomfortable.Besides the new keyboard, the model also includes a high-resolution Retina Display and up to 64GB of memory.Dieter Bohn, at The Verge, wrote the new keyboard had ""major improvements"".Since 2015, the keyboards on MacBook Pro computers have divided opinion, with some saying the butterfly mechanism made them less easy to type on.The new MacBook Pro's keys use a scissor-switch style action. The physical Esc, or escape, button has also been reinstated.It had been replaced by a virtual Touch Bar button on some previous models.The virtual Touch Bar remains in place at the top of the keyboard, however, as does a fingerprint sensor.There are few pieces of hardware that have caused me quite so much frustration as the keyboards on its recent MacBooks. The T key on my current machine is flapping about like a dead fingernail.Previously I've had to have the entire thing replaced thanks to keys either being dead, or over eeeeeeeeeeeenthusiastic, thanks to some minor dust or dirt.Even though these repairs are free, this isn't good enough for what should be the leading premium laptop on the market - and once-loyal Apple fans had run out of patience with the company.The keys use what's known as ""butterfly"" switches, designed under the watch of Sir Jony Ive, the recently-departed Apple design guru.When unveiled, the firm called it a breakthrough that allowed for slimmer laptops, thanks to the miniscule amount of ""travel"" - the distance the keys move under your fingers.What Apple seemed to miss was that many users liked the satisfaction of pressing a key - and the old MacBooks had it just right. Sir Jony had taken the equivalent of a fine Parker pen and swapped it for a chewed up Bic prone to leaking.I wasn't among the journalists invited by Apple to get an early look at the new MacBook, but long-time Apple commentator John Gruber was.""It's hard not to speculate that all of these changes are, to some degree, a de-Jony-Ive-ification of the keyboard,"" he noted, suggesting a change of focus now the revered 52-year-old has left.""I'm not sure I know anyone who would disagree that over the last five to six years, Apple's balance of how things work versus how things look has veered problematically toward making things look better - hardware and software - at the expense of how they function.""By redesigning the keyboard, Apple is attempting to show customers that it listens to them, said Ranjit Atwal at market analysis firm Gartner.""What you expect from Apple is incrementally better products and the last time round it wasn't incrementally better,"" he told the BBC.""They had to go and [rethink] the keyboard given the feedback.""Mr Atwal said that while Apple's MacBook Pros have some dedicated fans, the number of users who buy them is ""not huge"".""The challenge here is how to increase the install base,"" he added.Apple is also touting the laptop's improved ability to keep cool, thanks in part to fans with larger blades and vents allowing for a 28% increase in air flow.For graphical performance, the computer also includes an AMD Radeon Pro 5000M graphics card, which Apple says will mean smoother game play and faster rendering of effects in design programs.The new MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 (or £2,399 in the UK) and is now available to order from Apple's website.A worldwide launch in Apple's High Street stores will follow."
technology	Japan's cyber-security minister has 'never used a computer'		"Japan's new cyber-security minister has dumbfounded his country by saying he has never used a computer.Yoshitaka Sakurada made the admission to a committee of lawmakers.""Since I was 25 years old and independent I have instructed my staff and secretaries. I have never used a computer in my life,"" he said, according to a translation by the Kyodo news agency.The 68-year-old was appointed to his post last month.His duties include overseeing cyber-defence preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.A politician from the opposition Democratic Party, Masato Imai, whose question had prompted the admission, expressed surprise.""I find it unbelievable that someone who is responsible for cyber-security measures has never used a computer,"" he said.But Mr Sakurada responded that other officials had the necessary experience and he was confident there would not be a problem.However, his struggle to answer a follow-up question about whether USB drives were in use at the country's nuclear power stations caused further concern.The disclosure has been much discussed on social media where the reaction has been a mix of astonishment and hilarity, with some noting that at least it should mean Mr Sakurada would be hard to hack."
technology	Homes lost after mortgage computer bug		"A flaw in a US bank's computer software led to 625 customers not receiving government loan assistance to which they were entitled - and 400 of those went on to lose their homes.The government scheme was designed to help people struggling to pay their mortgages.Wells Fargo told CNN Money there was no ""clear direct cause and effect relationship"" between the error and the loss of homes.However, compensation is being offered.The bank has set aside $8m (£6m) to compensate those affected by the software error, which existed between April 2010 and October 2015.Wells Fargo revealed the information in its latest quarterly financial report and said there were continuing efforts to identify other customers who might have also been affected.The bank is the third largest in the US.In April 2018, it was fined $1bn by two US regulators to resolve investigations into car insurance and mortgage lending breaches.It did not admit to any wrongdoing."
technology	BBC releases computer history archive		"A slice of computing history has been made public, giving people the opportunity to delve into an archive that inspired a generation of coders.The Computer Literacy Project led to the introduction of the BBC Micro alongside programmes which introduced viewers to the principles of computing.It included interviews with innovators such as Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak.The BBC hopes the 1980s archive will encourage today's youngsters to become involved in computing.With the release of the archive, viewers can now search and browse all of the programmes from the project.They will be able to:Matthew Postgate, the BBC's chief technology and product officer, said: ""This archive offers a fascinating and nostalgic glimpse into an important milestone in the history of computing.""The hardware may have changed, but the principles still apply - which also makes it a unique resource for teaching and learning that will hopefully encourage a new generation of computer users.""In 2016, the BBC launched mini-computer micro:bit to one million schoolchildren across the UK as part of a renewed effort to get more people coding.The project was inspired by the launch of the BBC Micro four decades previously.That machine is seen by computer historians as a bridge between the early home computer and the ubiquitous PC that emerged in the 1990s.When it hit the market, an estimated 60% of primary schools and 85% of secondary schools adopted it.The accompanying 10-part TV series was initially intended to be broadcast in January 1982 but was delayed for a month because demand to buy the Micro was so great.Prof Steve Furber, principal designer of the BBC Micro, said it was important for today's generation - growing up with all-pervasive technology - to understand that that was not always the case.""The 1980s saw the emergence of the computer from the machine room, where it was under the control of a few folk in white coats, into homes and schools where it is accessible to all.""The BBC Micro not only gave folk access to a computer, but it also gave them easy access to its inner working, something that has been lost with most of today's very sophisticated technology.""Hermann Hauser, co-founder of Acorn Computers, added: ""The BBC Computer Literacy Project made Britain the most computer-literate nation on earth at the time and, with the BBC computer, created a generation of UK programmers who have become leaders in their field."""
technology	Why some computer viruses refuse to die	The living dudData of the dead	"There are zombies on the internet - odd, undead lumps of code that roam endlessly seeking and finding fresh victims to infect that help keep the whole ugly horde staggering on, and on.Most of these shambling data revenants are computer viruses and the most long-lived of all are worms.""Most of those worms are self-spreading - that's why we still see them moving around,"" said Candid Wueest, principal threat researcher at Symantec, who has hunted viruses for years.Typically, he said, when these malicious programs infected a machine, they kicked off a routine that scanned the entire net looking for other computers vulnerable in the same way as their current host.When they found one, they installed a copy that also started scanning.""All it takes is a few machines to get them moving around again,"" he added.One of the most active zombie viruses is Conficker, which first struck in November 2008. At its height, the worm is believed to have infected up to 15 million Windows PCs.The French navy, UK warships, Greater Manchester Police and many others were all caught out by Conficker, which targeted the Windows XP operating system.The malware caused so much trouble that Microsoft put up a bounty of $250,000 (£193,000) for any information that would lead to the capture of Conficker's creators.That bounty was still live and, Microsoft told the BBC, remained unclaimed to this day.Dr Paul Vixie, from Farsight Security, was part of the Conficker Working Group, set up when the malware was at its feverish peak.The group had managed to stem the tide of infection, said Dr Vixie, because of the way the virus worked.One of the ways it spread was by it checking one of a handful of net domains for instructions or updates every day.And the first two variants of Conficker picked one domain from a list of 250 randomly generated names.But some clever software reverse engineering worked out how the daily domains were generated.In 2008, Dr Vixie helped to run the net's Domain Name System so was able to co-ordinate a global effort to register every day's possible domains before the malware's creators did the same.And data sent from infected machines was then ""sinkholed"" almost neutering Conficker's ability to spread.""We got it from 11 million down to one million,"" said Dr Vixie. ""That sounds like progress but one million is still a pretty big number.""That zombie virus was still wandering around, said Dr Vixie.Statistics gathered by Symantec suggest there were 1.2 million Conficker infections in 2016 and 840,000 in 2017.India suffered the highest number of infections last year.""The population is gradually reducing in size because eventually computers wear out or they get upgraded or replaced,"" Dr Vixie said.And that is just as well because the concerted efforts to directly combat Conficker are all but at an end.Dr Vixie and some others still block a few of the domains its variants seeks out but only to sample the traffic they send to get an idea of the viral load Conficker places on the net.The good news was that Conficker had never been ""weaponised"", said Dr Vixie.His theory is that Conficker escaped too early and was too successful for its creators to risk making it more malicious.But Conficker was not alone in persisting long after its initial outburst, said Mr Wueest, from Symantec.Its network of sensors across the net regularly catches a wide range of malware that has lasted for much longer than anyone expected.Symantec regularly sees the SillyFDC virus from 2007, Virut from 2006 and even a file infector called Sality that dates from 2003.""We do see Dos viruses now and then,"" he said. The disk operating system (Dos) is more than 36 years old and dates from the early days of the desktop PC. Even older versions ran on mainframes.""Our guess is that sometimes it is researchers that have found an old disk and its gets run and gets detected,"" said Mr Wueest.There were many others, said Martin Lee, technical, lead for security research at Cisco.""Malware samples can be long-lived in that they are continued to be observed 'in the wild' many months or years after they were first encountered,"" he said.One regularly caught in the spam traps by Cisco is another worm, called MyDoom, that appeared in 2004.""It's often the most commonly detected malware we get in our traps,"" said Mr Lee.But many viruses lived on in another fashion, he said, because of the way the cyber-crime underground treated code.""Malware is rarely static,"" he said, ""computer code from older malware families can be shared, or stolen, and used in the development of new malware.""One prime example of this, said Mr Lee, was the Zeus banking Trojan, whose source code was leaked in 2011.That code had proved so useful that it was still turning up seven years later, he said.The trend of zombie malware was likely to continue if more modern viruses were any guide, said Mr Lee.Mirai first appeared in 2016 but is proving hard to eradicate.""It has features suggesting that it will be exceptionally long lived,"" Mr Lee said.The bug infects networked devices unlikely to be running anti-virus software. Some cannot be upgraded to run any kind of decent protection.As the net grows and starts to incorporate more of those dumber devices, Mirai, like Conficker will probably never be eradicated.""With the source code of the malware leaked, and a simple method of propagation using default usernames and passwords to compromise devices, it is something that will be with us for years,"" Mr Lee said."
technology	'I lost £4,000 in a call centre scam'	Important evidenceHow to avoid being scammed'A warning'	"When Doug Varey clicked on a pop-up ad offering computer security protection for 12 years for £556, he signed up.""I had no reason to suspect it wasn't genuine,"" he says.That was a mistake. Mr Varey was a victim of a common online scam known as computer software service fraud, which ended up costing him some £4,000.Indian police have now shut two call centres and arrested seven people suspected of involvement in the scam, which has seen victims lose thousands.The arrests follow an international operation involving British and Indian Police and the tech giant Microsoft.The BBC has had exclusive access to the operation.The investigation, which has taken four years, focused on what is known as computer software service fraud.The City of London Police say it is one of the most common online scams, with over 2,000 cases reported to Action Fraud every month.The raids by the cyber division of Kolkata Police targeted two call centres in the Indian city thought to have been used to target thousands of victims in the UK and the United States.Retired businessman Mr Varey says the price of the computer security protection first attracted him."" I thought per year, that's quite cheap. And I agreed to sign up for it.""A few months later the phone rang one evening in his Devon home. It was the security firm telling him he had a serious problem and needed to go and look at his computer.There he was shown what he was told was a Russian man who had taken over his computer. ""I looked at this screen where there's a picture of a thick-set man in his 50s, I guess, on a computer doing things.""And this chap said 'Oh my God, oh my God, this is worse than I thought.' And he was increasing my level of anxiety to the point where I was panicking.""He was then shown the man buying guns, ammunition and hand grenades. The adviser on the phone said there was one thing he could do to make the problem go away - pay for an advanced level of security at a ""special offer"" price of £4,000.""Now at that time, it wouldn't matter what he said,"" he explains. ""I wanted to finish with the problem.""While he thought he had been speaking to someone based in New York, the money was paid to a company called Vision Call Services, with an address in Kolkata in India.It was only some weeks later that Mr Varey realised that he had been a victim of computer software service fraud.He was recently contacted by a Microsoft executive seconded to the investigation which has seen the City of London Police working with several Indian police forces. Microsoft got involved in funding the inquiry because the scam callers often claim to be working for the company.The documents supplied by Mr Varey were important evidence as the operation to raid call-centres in Kolkata was planned.The City of London Police said anyone who thought they had been targeted by a computer software service scam should contact Action Fraud.The police offered these tips to avoid being scammed:The offices of Vision Call Services was one of the locations targeted. A statement from the Kolkata Police said they had found an illegal call centre in operation, with callers introducing themselves as officials from Microsoft. A number of computers and hard disks were seized, and four people were arrested.Commander Karen Baxter of the City of London Police said the international operation sent a message to criminals: ""Overseas fraudsters should see this as a warning: we will use every tactic in our power to halt your pernicious criminal activities.""The fraudsters use a variety of techniques to extract cash from their victims. Sometimes they use popup ads to offer a worthless anti-virus protection package, or they call claiming they have detected a fault on your PC.But often they persuade their victims to give them remote access to their computers. Once they have achieved that, they move on to getting into their target's online bank account.Commander Baxter says these are unscrupulous criminals who will stop at nothing to bleed their victims dry: ""They are very convincing, tenacious and have developed sophisticated systems in an effort to elude capture.""Microsoft welcomed the success of the operation in Kolkata. The firm's UK head of legal affairs Hugh Milward said:""Effective public-private partnerships are essential if we are to combat sophisticated cyber criminals who operate on a global scale.""The company says it will never cold call people to offer technical support.Mr Varey says he feels ""a plonker"" for having fallen for the scam but he wants to help others avoid being deceived.""The money is gone but what I really want to do is stop other people falling for this same scam."""
technology	Original working Apple-I computer fetches $375,000 at auction	'Behave like it's 1976'Award for Ive	"An Apple-I computer, the first product made by the computing giant, has sold at auction for $375,000 (£230,000).The machine was designed by Steve Wozniak, known as Woz, the co-founder of Apple.His business partner, Steve Jobs, convinced him to package and sell the machine - it went on sale in 1976 for $666.66.It is one of only a handful of fully-functioning models known to be in existence today.""The Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II,"" said Mr Wozniak in an email to the BBC on Tuesday.""But this Apple-I computer showed the world the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer.""The auction took place in Boston, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. The buyer was an ""anonymous businessman"" who placed his bid online.It is estimated that Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs sold around 200 Apple-I computers in just under a year, thanks to a deal with a local computing store in Palo Alto, California.According to an online registry - not affiliated with Apple - there are just 79 of the computers still around.""It's a marvellous piece - and this one works!"" said Bobby Livingston, of RR Auctions.'Never out of the book' - How the Apple-I was builtBy Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, speaking to the BBC""The Apple-I was an important device that was scraped together very quickly from a homebuilt terminal. The terminal (keyboard and TV) were created to access the early long distance network, Arpanet, and it could only handle 60 data bytes per second, due to modem speeds then, whereas the microprocessor could access 100,000 data bytes per second. Hence the Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II, but this Apple-I computer showed the world, starting with the Homebrew Computer Club members, the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer.""I gave my designs away for free at the Homebrew Computer Club. My belief in how computers could help with education led me to plead with Steve Jobs to give the first Apple-I to a woman in our club, Liza Loop, the first Apple-I to possibly take into elementary school classrooms to show the students what a computer was. Steve made me buy it (from us) for $300 - and I gave it to Liza myself.""We might have made 150 Apple-I boards. Steve Jobs handled the business of the Apple-I and we actually built up a bank account of about $12,000. It was my idea to price it at $666.66. So few of these boards are known that the scarcity gives them high value.""It's fair to say that the Apple-I was the first personal computer, depending on how you define 'personal'. The Apple-I and Apple-II took steps that had never been taken before.""It's how I did things, never out of the book.""""Our experts tell us that there might be 15 in the world that work properly. You can power this thing up and behave like it's 1976. It's pretty fantastic.""The Apple-I holds a place in technology history as the first computer to not require any assembly, other than to plug in a monitor and keyboard.The Apple-I provided just a glimpse of what was to come. Mr Wozniak's follow up, the Apple-II range, went on to sell more than 5 million units, putting Apple on its course to become the most valuable company in US history.In August, Apple's value surpassed $1tn for the first time, spurred by sales of the iPhone.British designer Sir Jony Ive, who along with Mr Jobs designed the iPhone, was announced on Tuesday as the recipient of the Professor Hawking Fellowship by the Cambridge Union.The fellowship programme was set up in 2017 to highlight the legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking, who died in March.As part of the fellowship, Sir Jony will address the Cambridge Union at a date not yet made public.""The Hawking Committee are of the opinion that Sir Jony's work and patents have played a pivotal role in shaping Apple's successes over the last two decades,"" the Cambridge Union said.""His undoubted technological expertise, coupled with his remarkable role in championing elegant & innovative design on a global stage have made Sir Jony uniquely qualified to receive this Fellowship."""
technology	Tablet computer 'kills child' in car crash in Spain	Boredom risk	"The death of a girl hit by a tablet computer in a car accident has raised concerns about the safety of using such devices in moving vehicles.The three-year-old was killed after her mother's car collided with the back of a school bus in Spain on Monday.Local reports indicate the girl was strapped into an Isofix-anchored child seat but the impact caused the tablet to fly into her face.Road safety organisations have stressed that the tragedy was highly unusual.The accident occurred in Vilanova de Arousa, a town in the north-west of Spain.The child has not been named but is reported to be the granddaughter of a well-known local businessman.Although the cause of death has yet to be confirmed, the police have said that the unsecured tablet had appeared to have caused severe head injuries.The girl's 26-year-old mother and a student on the bus were said to have been treated for minor injuries.""This is a tragic accident, which will send a shudder down the spine of every parent who lets their child use a tablet or smartphone as entertainment on any car journey,"" the RAC's road safety expert Pete Williams told the BBC.""We have not heard of any similar incidents but it is important to realise that in a high-speed accident any hard object which is not strapped down inside a vehicle has the potential to become a lethal projectile.""Tablets and other electronic devices are commonly used by parents to keep their children occupied during car journeys.Equipment exists to lock them to the back of the seat in front of the child. But this can prevent youngsters from being able to reach the screen, making it a more passive experience.The UK's Highway Code requires that ""heavy or sharp objects [be] secured safely"" because of the risk of injury to those inside vehicles - but there is no law saying that such products must be fastened down.""There are products that can be used to strap devices to the seat on front, which parents can use to reduce the risk that unsecured objects can pose,"" said Edmund King, the Automobile Association's president.""However, we are not aware of any similar cases and this does appear to be a freak incident.""The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said parents should not rush to ban electronic devices from vehicles since noisy, bored children posed risks of their own.""This is clearly a very tragic but very rare incident,"" said Nick Lloyd, Rospa's road safety manager.""Any unsecured object within a vehicle has the potential to become a projectile and injure someone in a crash, and parents should be aware of this, but at the same time it may be more dangerous to have an unentertained child in the back of a car on a long journey, distracting the driver."""
technology	Codebreaking Bombe moves to computer museum	Modern machines	The UK's National Museum of Computing has expanded its exhibits celebrating the UK's wartime code-breakers and the machines used to crack German ciphers.On Saturday it will open a gallery dedicated to the Bombe, which helped speed up the cracking of messages scrambled with the Enigma machine.The Bombe was formerly on display at Bletchley Park next door to the museum.A crowd-funding campaign raised £60,000 in four weeks to move the machine and create its new home.The replica Bombe is a copy of the electro-mechanical machines used in World War II at Bletchley. It was designed to discover the settings used by German Enigma machines to scramble messages, and make them unreadable.Code-breakers at Bletchley turned to machines to crank through the millions of settings made possible using the Enigma machine so they could quickly discover which were being used.The initial design of the Bombe was drawn up by Alan Turing and later refined by Gordon Welchman. The gallery is being opened on the 106th anniversary of Turing's birth.The Bombe is a replica painstakingly constructed by a team recruited by retired engineer John Harper. The team was gathered in the 1990s and the replica was completed in 2007.The gallery housing the machine will be opened by two of the original Bombe operators. A demonstration will be given of how it was used to crack German codes.The Bombe will sit alongside other key machines used by code-breakers at Bletchley, including Colossus - a forerunner to modern computers - which was developed to tackle messages passing to and from Hitler and his high command.The work done by the thousands of workers at Bletchley during the war, cracking the secret messages, is believed to have shortened the conflict by several years and saved many lives.
technology	Deepfake videos 'double in nine months'	Fake images, real money	"New research shows an alarming surge in the creation of so-called deepfake videos, with the number online almost doubling in the last nine months. There is also evidence that production of these videos is becoming a lucrative business.And while much of the concern about deepfakes has centred on their use for political purposes, the evidence is that pornography accounts for the overwhelming majority of the clips.The research comes from cyber-security company Deeptrace. Its researchers found 14,698 deepfake videos online, compared with 7,964 in December 2018.They said 96% were pornographic in nature, often with a computer-generated face of a celebrity replacing that of the original adult actor in a scene of sexual activity.While many of the subjects featured were American and British actresses, the researchers found that South Korean K-Pop singers were also commonly inserted into fake videos, highlighting that this is a global phenomenon.The report does highlight the potential for the use of deepfake technology to be used in political campaigns. But in the two cases it highlights - in Gabon and Malaysia - the allegations that faked videos had been used turned out to be incorrect.What seems clear, though, is that the real danger at the moment is the use of the technology in revenge porn and cyber-bullying.Henry Ajder, head of research analysis at Deeptrace, says too much of the discussion of deepfakes misses the mark.""The debate is all about the politics or fraud and a near-term threat, but a lot of people are forgetting that deepfake pornography is a very real, very current phenomenon that is harming a lot of women,"" he explains.Deeptrace's very existence is evidence of how rapidly the deepfake phenomenon has become a concern for corporations and governments.It describes its mission as protecting ""individuals and organisations from the damaging impacts of AI- generated synthetic media"".The term deepfake was first coined in a Reddit post in 2017, and this report explains that in just two years a whole industry has emerged to profit from this phenomenon.Deeptrace found that the four leading deepfake-themed pornography websites, supported by advertising, had attracted 134 million views for their videos since February 2018.Apps making it possible to create this material are now proliferating.One that allowed users to synthetically remove the clothes from still images of women charged $50 (£40) for removing a watermark from each finished product.Visits to the app's website surged after a critical article was written about it, and the owners took it down.But the software is still out there, repackaged by others seeking to profit from it.One independent expert highlighted that other software has also made it much easier to create fake videos than before.""It's now become possible to create a passable deepfake with only a small amount of input material - the algorithms need smaller and smaller amounts of video or picture footage to train on,"" explained Katja Bego, principal researcher at innovation foundation Nesta.""As the technology is advancing so rapidly, it is important for policymakers to think now about possible responses. This means looking at developing detection tools and raising public awareness, but also [to] consider the underlying social and political dynamics that make deepfakes potentially so dangerous.""The authors of the Deeptrace report also describe service portals - online businesses generating and selling deepfake videos.One such portal required 250 photos of the target subject and two days of processing to generate a video. Deeptrace says the prices charged vary but can be as little as $2.99 per video.Another report earlier this year by the Witness Media Lab, a collaboration between a human-rights organisation and Google, found that creating deepfake videos still requires some skill - but that is changing quickly.The report says right now simulating actual faces completely realistically still involves a significant team of people with specialised skills and technology.But the lengthy process is being automated, allowing people without that specialist knowledge to make videos that may be less sophisticated but can be generated much faster.Looking at videos flagged with the deepfake hashtag on YouTube, there are some impressive examples of how the technology is being used by professional teams.One video where The Shining suddenly features Jim Carrey in the Jack Nicholson role, is made by an artist called Ctrl Shift Face.The anonymous creator helpfully warns on his channel: ""Do not believe everything that you see on the internet, OK?""Ctrl Shift Face's aim is to entertain rather than deceive. But there are obviously fears that such fakery could be used to sway an election campaign or whip up hatred against a particular group.So far, however, there appear to be few, if any, instances of deepfakes succeeding in fooling people for malevolent purposes.Now, as a business set up to protect organisations from this phenomenon, it could be in the interests of Deeptrace to hype this threat. And Ms Bego questioned whether deepfake-detection technology is the right approach.""A viral video can reach an audience of millions and make headlines within a matter of hours,"" she explained.""A technological arbiter telling us the video was doctored after the fact might simply be too little too late.""In any case, it appears that in the short term the real victims of malicious users of deepfake videos will not be governments and corporations but individuals, most of them women.It is unlikely that they will be able to afford to hire specialists to combat their abusers."
technology	Ex-Yahoo engineer hacked accounts seeking pornography		"A former Yahoo software engineer has pleaded guilty to charges of illegally accessing user accounts.Reyes Daniel Ruiz admitted he had ""hacked"" about 6,000 accounts, seeking sexual images and videos.The US Department of Justice said Ruiz had ""cracked"" user passwords and accessed internal Yahoo systems while hunting for pornography.Ruiz also used access to Yahoo accounts to target other online services users had signed up for.In a statement, the DoJ said the access Ruiz had attained to Yahoo user data had helped him ""compromise"" Apple iCloud, Facebook, GMail, Dropbox and other online accounts.And he had used his access to the accounts to reset passwords so he could access the other systems.Ruiz had targeted friends, co-workers and many young women during his hacking campaign, the DoJ said.He had copied many of the images and videos he had found and kept the material at his home.And soon after Yahoo discovered his activities, in 2018, Ruiz had destroyed the computer and hard drives on which the stolen data had been stored.Ruiz was charged in April this year and has now signed an agreement with the DoJ which will see him pleading guilty to one count of computer intrusion.He is due to be sentenced in February 2020. The maximum jail term for computer intrusion is five years plus a fine of $250,000 (£203,000) and damages."
technology	Rush to fix 'serious' computer chip flaws	Security updates	"Tech firms are working to fix two major bugs in computer chips that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data.The bugs are an ""absolute disaster"" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher.Google researchers said one of the ""serious security flaws"", dubbed ""Spectre"", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM.The other, known as ""Meltdown"" affects Intel-made chips and one recent ARM chip.The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public.The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited.It has issued guidance about Meltdown and Spectre, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves.According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected.Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide.""These bugs are an absolute disaster,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House.While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example.""You may find that patches aren't yet available,"" he told the BBC.Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones.In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it.In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party.The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips.""Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" said Intel.ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers.AMD said it believed there was ""near zero risk to AMD products at this time"".On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices.Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised.Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops.As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited.Google published a blog detailing what some customers may need to do. It said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser.The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users ""continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.""When asked whether hackers will make use of the bugs to attack computers, experts advised caution on the issue.""It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey."
technology	Data on almost every Ecuadorean citizen leaked	Serious breach	"Personal data about almost every Ecuadorean citizen has been found exposed online.Names, financial information and civil data about 17 million people, including 6.7 million children, was found by security company vpnMentor.The massive cache of data was found on an unsecured cloud server almost anyone could look at.Access to the server has now been restricted thanks to Ecuador's computer emergency security team.""The data breach involves a large amount of sensitive personally identifiable information at the individual level,"" wrote Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, from vpnMentor.As well as basic identity data, the exposed files include:The cache of information also included some financial records tallying account balances of customers of one large Ecuadorean bank. Tax records, including official revenue ID numbers for companies, were found on another file.""This data breach is particularly serious simply because of how much information was revealed about each individual,"" the security researchers said.The pair said they had found the 18GB of data spread across a variety of files saved on an unsecured server set up and run by Novaestrat - an Ecuadorean marketing and analytics company.Novaestrat has not yet responded to a BBC News request for a comment or statement.The news about the data breach was broken on the ZDNet website by reporter Catalin Cimpanu, who said it would be ""as valuable as gold in the hands of criminal gangs"".Simple searches of the data could reveal lists of wealthy Ecuadoreans, their home addresses, if they had children, the cars they drove and their registration plate numbers, he said.Access to the data had been cut off after the Ecuador Computer Emergency Response Team had been alerted, Mr Cimpanu wrote."

If you receive an unexpected phone call claiming to be from Trend Micro, hang up and report the incident to Trend Micro support using our official contact details below,"" the company said.A UK ruling that suggests companies can be held responsible if their own staff leak data is currently being challenged by supermarket chain Morrison's.In 2014, an internal auditor at the retailer stole the data, including salary and bank details, of nearly 100,000 staff and posted it online.Andrew Skelton was jailed for eight years in 2015 after being found guilty at Bradford Crown Court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data.However, a group legal action also found the supermarket responsible for the actions of its staff.The retailer is currently challenging the ruling at the UK's Supreme Court."
technology	Why are pupils switching off from computing GCSE?		"If you think that computing skills are vital for Britain's economic future, there is worrying news in Thursday's GCSE results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.They show a drop of more than 40,000 in the numbers sitting for a qualification in either computing or ICT (information and communications technology). What is more, there is a growing gender gap, with boys outnumbering girls by more than three to one in choosing to take the subjects.In 2019 a total of 89,542 students took either the ICT or the computing GCSE, compared with a combined total of 130,210 in 2018. Male entries totalled 68,965, compared with 20,577 girls taking the exams.What all this reflects is something this blog has covered previously, the unintended consequences of the phasing out of the ICT exam in England - it was still taken in Wales and Northern Ireland this year - and its replacement by the far more challenging computing.As the much derided ICT subject disappeared from the curriculum, it was hoped that schools and pupils would embrace the much more rigorous computing course, giving a big upgrade to the nation's digital skills.But that has not happened - at least not on the scale needed. While entries for computing have risen, they have come nowhere near matching the decline in the numbers studying ICT.Meanwhile, the gender gap has opened up. Five years ago, girls made up about 40% of entries for the ICT exam, this year they accounted for only 21% of computing entries. The Joint Council for Qualifications hailed what it called a ""significant rise in female entries in computing"" in 2019, but that was from a very low base.The evidence is that many schools are struggling to find the teachers needed to tackle this difficult course, and may not be too keen to persuade pupils to enter an exam where getting a decent grade will not be easy.The computing exam may produce more of the high-end programming knowhow which the ICT course ignored, but for employers looking to recruit people with a wide range of tech skills, the GCSE figures are a concern.""The digital skills gap in industry is fast expanding and already at a level that can't be filled quickly enough,"" says Agata Nowakowska, of Skillsoft, which provides workplace e-learning courses.""We need to take action now to turn this around.""While the ICT course was criticised for teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office, its defenders said it did provide a basic grounding in IT skills.They argued that it could be revamped and retained as an option alongside the computing GCSE. They will now feel vindicated by this latest evidence that tech education is becoming a minority sport."
technology	Computer science: Girls logging off		"If you are looking for signs that technical education is being transformed, and that girls are now more eager to study subjects such as computing, then my advice is to avoid the latest GCSE results.I have written before about fears that the revolution in computing education has stalled. Now the GCSEs, coupled with the recent A-level results, provide more evidence for those concerns.In England, entries for the new computer science GCSE, which is supposed to replace ICT, rose modestly from 60,521 in 2016 to 64,159 this year. Girls accounted for just 20% of entries, and the proportion was a tiny bit lower than last year.ICT entries fell from 84,120 to 73,099, which you would expect as the subject is disappearing from the national curriculum. But it had proved more attractive to girls. Even there, the proportion of female entries fell from 41% to 39%.Combine the two subjects, and you find that the number studying either subject has fallen by over 7,000 in the past year. Back in 2015 more than 47,000 girls were getting some kind of computing qualification, and that has fallen to about 41,000 - just 30% of the total.The consultancy Accenture points out that the figure for the engineering GCSE is even worse, with girls making up just 10% of the entrants. Emma McGuigan, the company's group technology officer, said it was a stark reflection of the challenges the tech industry faces when it comes to diversity.""Our research found that girls are turning away from Stem [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] subjects at an early age with stereotypes, negative perceptions and poor understanding of career options all having an impact,"" she said.Bill Mitchell from the British Computing Society (BCS) is concerned about the overall numbers studying computing. He says schools are not offering enough pupils the chance to study the subject because ICT teachers are unprepared for the new course: ""A large number just don't have the subject knowledge for the new, more rigorous, computer science GCSE.""The BCS is part of a programme to help teachers upgrade their skills, but says it is only funded to reach 20% of schools.It says there is still work to do to help girls see computing as a subject for them.""We need to do more with the curriculum to show it's not just a nerdy boys' subject,"" said Mr Mitchell. ""We've got to show them it's about real problems like climate change and improving healthcare.""The government says it is determined to keep the UK at the cutting edge of the digital revolution after Brexit. But right now, the message from the exam system is that too few will leave school with the skills needed to fulfil that promise."
technology	iPhone 5 users risk losing internet access	How do I update my software?Which older models are affected?	Apple iPhone 5 users have been warned to update their software before the weekend or face losing access to the internet.The technology giant said users who did not download iOS 10.3.4 by 3 November would be locked out of features that rely on the correct time and date.This includes the App Store, email, web browsing and storage service iCloud.While it is not the latest version of the operating system, it is the most up-to-date available for the model.Users of older iPhones have also been advised to update their software in order to maintain accurate GPS location services.iPhone 5 users have received pop-up messages in recent days urging them to update to the latest iOS.The software can be updated wirelessly or by using a computer, before 3 November.After this, owners will need to connect their device to a Mac or PC, because wireless updates will no longer work.Apple said iPhone 5 users should check that they are running software version 10.3.4.Apple also said anyone with an iPhone 4S and some older versions of the iPad should download the latest software to ensure GPS services keep working.This includes owners of the first generation iPad mini and fourth generation iPad and older.Owners of newer models are not affected. WiFi-only models are also unaffected.The iPhone 5 launched in September 2012, and received two million pre-orders in the first 24 hours of launch, according to Apple.It was the first iPhone to feature Apple's lightning charger, which was a move away from the old, 30-pin connector.Apple said around 70 million iPhone 5 handsets were sold.
technology	BBC News launches 'dark web' Tor mirror	What is Tor?	"The BBC has made its international news website available via the Tor network, in a bid to thwart censorship attempts.The Tor browser is privacy-focused software used to access the dark web.The browser can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed, which can help people avoid government surveillance and censorship.Countries including China, Iran and Vietnam are among those who have tried to block access to the BBC News website or programmes.Instead of visiting bbc.co.uk/news or bbc.com/news, users of the Tor browser can visit the new bbcnewsv2vjtpsuy.onion web address. Clicking this web address will not work in a regular web browser.The dark web copy of the BBC News website will be the international edition, as seen from outside the UK.It will include foreign language services such as BBC Arabic, BBC Persian and BBC Russian.But UK-only content and services such as BBC iPlayer will not be accessible, due to broadcast rights.Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it.The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible.As well as allowing users to visit normal websites anonymously, it can also be used as part of a process to host hidden sites, which use the .onion suffix.Tor's users include the military, law enforcement officers and journalists, as well as members of the public who wish to keep their browser activity secret.But it has also been associated with illegal activity, allowing people to visit sites offering illegal drugs for sale and access to child abuse images, which do not show up in normal search engine results and would not be available to those who did not know where to look.While the Tor browser can be used to access the regular version of the BBC News website, using the .onion site has additional benefits.""Onion services take load off scarce exit nodes, preserve end-to-end encryption [and] the self-authenticating domain name resists spoofing,"" explained Prof Steven Murdoch, a cyber-security expert from University College London.In a statement, the BBC said: ""The BBC World Service's news content is now available on the Tor network to audiences who live in countries where BBC News is being blocked or restricted. This is in line with the BBC World Service mission to provide trusted news around the world.""On Wednesday, the BBC also announced the UK's first interactive voice news service for smart speakers.People using an Amazon Alexa-powered device will be able to skip ahead and get more information about the stories they are most interested in."
technology	Government urged to act over computer science GCSEs	Computer science in numbersAnalysis	"More than half of England's secondary schools, 54%, did not offer GCSE computer science in 2015-16, a report from the Royal Society has found.It urged the government to increase spending on computer education tenfold over the next five years to ensure youngsters can ""unlock the full potential of new technologies"".The biggest issue was the lack of skilled teachers, the report found.The Department for Education said more pupils were choosing the subject.""We want to ensure our future workforce has the skills we need to drive the future productivity and economy of this country and that is why the government made computing a compulsory part of the national curriculum,"" said a spokesperson.""Computer science GCSE entries continue to rise more quickly than any other subject.""We recently saw an increase in entries to Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and maths] for the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the number of girls taking Stem subjects at A-levels has increased by over 17% since 2010.""Since 2012, the department has pledged £5m to the Network of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science programme, which has built a national network of nearly 400 computer science specialists (who) schools can commission to provide bespoke training for their teachers.""The Royal Society, the UK's independent scientific academy, is concerned about how the lack of computing expertise will affect the future workforce.Prof Steve Furber, who worked on the report, said: ""Computing teachers have told us that they feel the government rushed in a new curriculum without giving them the support or money to deliver it.""The report paints a bleak picture in England, which meets only 68% of its computing teacher recruitment targets and where, as a result, one in two schools don't offer computer science at GCSE, a crucial stage of young people's education.""He added that, ""overhauling the fragile state of our computing education"" would require an ambitious, multipronged approach.The Royal Society called for:by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondentThis report highlights what some teachers have been telling me for a while - that the revolution in computing education in the UK has stalled.Five years ago a head of steam built up behind the idea that children needed to be taught coding and that the ICT GCSE was not fit for purpose, teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office.The government responded by taking ICT off the National Curriculum and replacing it with computer science.But this course is proving far more demanding of both pupils and teachers, and many schools have decided that it is just not worth the bother at a time when resources are tight.Some ICT teachers who had always argued that it was a practical course, attractive to a far wider range of children, are now saying ""I told you so"".But across the world of computing education there's agreement on one thing - more money needs to be spent on training teachers in this vital subject.Prof Furber's views were echoed by technology firms Microsoft and Google, who are both working to increase computer skills among schoolchildren.Google's UK managing director Ronan Harris said: ""There is still much more to do to ensure young people across the UK have access to computer science education.""Whatever school they attend or whatever field they plan to go into, every student should have the opportunity to understand the principles and practices of computing.""And Microsoft's UK chief executive Cindy Rose said: ""The risk, if we don't make these investments now, is that too many young people struggle to access new opportunities and the UK loses its advantage in a world being transformed by technology."""
technology	Tech Tent: BA’s computer meltdown	Lessons from an IT disasterRough GamesWannaCry and the Underworld	"This week has seen another example of the chaos that can ensue when complex computer systems fail. On Tech Tent we try to draw some lessons from the British Airways IT fiasco.We also discuss bullying in online games and hear what the criminal underworld is saying about the WannaCry ransomware attack.Last weekend's catastrophic failure in BA's computer system threw the travel plans of 75,000 passengers into chaos. What went wrong has become a little clearer - it appears the power somehow went off at a Heathrow data centre and when it was switched back on a power surge somehow took out the whole system.Airline bosses insist that this means the whole incident was a power failure not an IT failure - but experts point out that power management is an essential element of any well-planned IT system.Bert Craven of the consultancy T2RL, who has designed systems for major airlines, tells us the real question is whether the airline had what he calls geo-redundancy.""This is a duplicate mirrored system in a data centre at a distance. Clearly either that was not the case or there was also a problem with the geo-redundant system at the same time - a perfect storm.""He reckons every airline IT executive will have been hauled out of their bed last weekend to be asked: ""Could this happen to us?""Passengers may be tempted to ask whether it would be simpler to abandon the computers and return to paper. Mr Craven tells us that until a few years ago, airports were in the habit of printing out passenger manifests and other documents at the beginning of the day just in case things went wrong.These days however there is just too much real-time data involved in running complex airline operations for that to be feasible. Only computers can make modern air travel work, and when they fail it is like throwing sand into the machine.We are all sadly familiar with the problem of abuse and bullying on social networks. But this week the anti-bullying charity Ditch The Label published research showing the extent of the problem in online video games.Its survey, carried out through the online game Habbo Hotel, showed more than half of young gamers reported that they had been subjected to hate speech while playing online. Bailey Mitchell, 16, told me he'd first experienced abuse when he was 10.And it was more than just banter - he was told to kill himself after scoring a goal in Fifa. Nowadays, he says, he can shrug it off, but when he was younger he'd come home from being bullied at school expecting to escape into a game, only to face abuse there too.The games industry was a bit sniffy about the charity's report, unconvinced that Habbo Hotel was the right place to get an overview of the gaming scene.Jo Twist of the British games body Ukie tells us that the industry is already acting responsibly, using everything from AI and semantic analysis to human moderators to detect abuse.""Players are our lifeblood,"" she says. ""We use all sorts of tools to make sure they have a safe experience.""But she says it's also up to players and parents to take responsibility. ""There are games that are suitable for everybody - and some games are only suitable for 18-plus audiences.""It's still not clear who was behind last month's WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected organisations around the world, including hospitals here in the UK. But whoever it was, it seems the criminal underworld was not happy about it.Andrei Barysevich is a cyber-security researcher at the Recorded Future threat intelligence company, who works as a consultant to the FBI and spends a lot of time monitoring the dark web.He tells us that criminal hackers were not at all impressed by the high-profile nature of the attack - and were particularly angry about hospitals and police forces being attacked. Not because they were squeamish, you understand, but because governments and law enforcement agencies are on the warpath - and that has put criminal hackers in the spotlight.It seems there was even a meeting of elders of the criminal underground, at which they all declared that this attack was nothing to do with them. It seems that WannaCry was probably hatched by a relatively amateur group of hackers who may have been surprised by just how much mayhem they unleashed.It is as if a nuclear weapon fell into the hands of a group of teenage pranksters who thought it was just a firecracker - not an entirely reassuring thought."
technology	TEDGlobal: The computer that can smell explosives		"Nigerian Oshi Agabi has unveiled a computer based not on silicon but on mice neurons at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania.The system has been trained to recognise the smell of explosives and could be used to replace traditional airport security, he said.Eventually the modem-sized device - dubbed Koniku Kore - could provide the brain for future robots.Experts said that making such systems mass-market was challenging.All of the big tech firms, from Google to Microsoft, are rushing to create artificial intelligence modelled on the human brain.While computers are better than humans at complex mathematical equations, there are many cognitive functions where the brain is much better: training a computer to recognise smells would require colossal amounts of computational power and energy, for example.Mr Agabi is attempting to reverse-engineer biology, which already accomplishes this function with a fraction of the power it would take a silicon-based processor. ""Biology is technology. Bio is tech,"" he says. ""Our deep learning networks are all copying the brain.""He launched his start-up Koniku over a year ago, has raised $1m (£800,000) in funding and claims it is already making profits of $10m in deals with the security industry.Koniku Kore is an amalgam of living neurons and silicon, with olfactory capabilities — basically sensors that can detect and recognise smells.""You can give the neurons instructions about what to do - in our case we tell it to provide a receptor that can detect explosives.""He envisages a future where such devices can be discreetly used at various points in airports, eliminating the need for queues to get through airport security.As well as being used for bomb detection, the device could be used to detect illness by sensing markers of a disease in the air molecules that a patient gives off.The prototype device shown off at TED - the pictures of which cannot yet be publicly revealed - has partially solved one of the biggest challenges of harnessing biological systems - keeping the neurons alive, said Mr Agabi.In a video, he showed the device being taken out of the lab.""This device can live on a desk and we can keep them alive for a couple of months,"" he told the BBC.Ultimately though he has much bigger ambitions.""We think that the processing power that is going to run the robots of the future will be synthetic biology-based and we are laying the foundations for that today.""The fusion of biology and technology gained headlines recently when Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla and Space X, announced his latest venture - Neuralink - which aims to fuse the human brain with AI, using neural lace.Advances in neuroscience, bioengineering and computer science means that much more is known about how the human brain works than ever before.This is fuelling the development of neuro-technology - devices that aim to mould the brain into computers.Much of the current work is aimed at improving brain function, particularly for those with brain-related injuries or diseases.Prof John Donoghue, who heads up the Wyss Centre for bio and neuro-engineering in Geneva, has been at the forefront of work attempting to allow people with paralysis to move limbs using their brain waves.He believes the field is at a ""tipping point"" where biological and digital systems will come together.The idea being pursued by Mr Agabi is interesting, he said.""Digital computers are fast and reliable but dumb, whereas neurons are slow but smart,"" he said.""But they are not so good in a little dish and the big problem will be keeping them alive and happy. That is going to be a big challenge,"" he added.""Will we have a dish of neurons computing on our desk?

technology	Copycat coders create 'vulnerable' apps	Security risksThe hard way	"Lazy developers who copy solutions to tricky programming problems are creating apps that are vulnerable to attack, research suggests.A team of computer scientists looked at more than 72,000 chunks of code found on the Stack Overflow website.The site is popular with developers seeking advice on the best way to fix broken code.But researchers found many of the most copied snippets lacked basic checks that would stop common attacks.The dangerous code chunks often used obsolete functions, did little to check user responses and did not look for attempts to break the application, said the study.The researchers, also trawled through a website where many developers upload and share the code behind their apps and programmes.The most widely used insecure code blocks turned up in more than 2,800 separate projects on the Github website, they found.The research team, involving experts at Canadian and Iranian universities, focused on the C++ programming language, which is used in a huge variety of projects, from small programs to large distributed systems.The team informed those they found using the problematic code chunks on Github that they may have introduced security risks into their apps and programmes.But only 13% of the developers contacted said they had fixed the code, the researchers said. A similar number declined to fix the bugs.Some 40% said the code was safe because users could not change it once an app was running.""The people who are using Stack Overflow, they shouldn't trust it fully,"" said Prof Ashkan Sami, a computer scientist at Shiraz University in Iran who co-wrote the study.""It's better for programmers to do it the hard way and learn secure coding,"" he told The Register tech news site.Prof Sami said the team had developed an extension for the Chrome browser that checks when code is copied from Stack Overflow and lets coders know if it is poorly written or insecure."
technology	Apple to release source code for pre-Mac computer Lisa		"The source code for Apple's Lisa, the computer that pre-dated the Mac, is to be released, allowing anyone to tinker with an important slice of IT history.The Computer History Museum (CHM) announced that it had recovered the code and that Apple was reviewing it.Once the code is cleared for release, it will be made available at some point in 2018.The computer is generally regarded to have been one of Apple's biggest flops.CHM's software curator Al Kossow announced the news on a Lisa mailing list for fans.""Just wanted to let everyone know the sources to the OS and applications were recovered... and they are with Apple for review,"" he said.Once that review is completed, the Computer History Museum will post a blog about ""the historical significance of the software"", ahead of a release of the code later in the year.The Lisa - thought to have been named after Steve Jobs' daughter - was released in 1983 and was notable for being one of the first to feature a graphical interface and support for a mouse.Its $10,000 price tag - around $24,000 (£17,000) factoring in inflation - contributed to the fact that it only sold 10,000 units.The Mac, which was essentially a more affordable and improved version of Lisa, was released in 1984.The operating system behind Lisa became the cause of one of the biggest rifts in technology history, with Apple suing Microsoft over the first version of Windows, claiming the firm stole Lisa's technology.The news of the source code's release was greeted with enthusiasm on the fan forum it was announced on.""Wow, what fantastic news! Many questions about what's included in the source code but I guess I'll just wait to see. Thanks to everyone involved,"" wrote one.It was also welcomed on Twitter."
technology	Tech Tent: Google hardware, computer mining, scam baiting	Google's hardware hopesAre you mining for nothing?Baiting the scammers	"On Tech Tent this week, we reflect on what Google's new products say about its desire to be a hardware giant. We learn about the browser software that could mean your computer is secretly making money for someone else. And we meet the man who's turned the tables on the online scammers.Google has become one of the most powerful companies in the world on the back of software - from search to Gmail, from the Chrome browser and Android operating system to YouTube.Its attempts to become a big name in hardware have been somewhat less successful - but it keeps on trying.This week saw the company unveil a range of new devices, including new Pixel smartphones and Google Home smart speakers. The message at the launch was that by combining its skills in artificial intelligence, software and hardware it could build compelling products.Rick Osterloh, who heads up Google's devices division, was surely right when he says that innovation in smartphone hardware had just about reached its limits. ""It's going to be tougher and tougher for people to develop exciting new products each year,"" he told the audience in California, insisting that software and AI were now the key differentiators.Crispin Lowery, head of hardware for Google Europe, tells Tech Tent more about the hardware strategy: ""We're building devices that lead the way in customer experience,"" he says, explaining that the seamless integration of Google software on its own brand products should give it an edge.But the jury is out on whether customers are going to be so impressed by the AI services provided by the Google Assistant or its Photos app that they rush out to buy new Pixel phones or Google Home speakers.My hunch is that right now it is a brand with a track record that really matters - and most people will think of Samsung for smartphones or Amazon for smart speakers ahead of Google.The boom in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is having all sorts of interesting knock-on effects. We report this week on the hidden software that may mean your computer or smartphone is earning money for someone else without your knowledge.What happens is that a website wanting to earn extra cash, perhaps to find an alternative to advertising, installs a script that means visitors' computers are employed to mine cryptocurrencies - in other words, solve increasingly complex maths problems that generate new coins.In many cases the sites are open about this, but sometimes users are left in the dark.There is also growing evidence that criminals are infecting sites with this software and thereby capturing thousands of computers or smartphones to act as unconscious mineworkers.""The more computing power that's out there, the better for you as a criminal,"" explains Rik Ferguson of the security firm Trend Micro.It's quite hard to know if your computer has been hijacked in this way, although if the fan comes on and everything slows down that is a clue.Look out for more on this story here on the BBC News website from Mark Ward - his investigation will be published next week.I don't know about you but I get a lot of scam calls - people pretending my computer has a problem, or wanting to advise me on how to claim money for an accident I've apparently suffered. And quite often I take pleasure in keeping them on the phone, stringing them along as they try to defraud me.One caller from the ""Windows Computer Service Centre"" was so incensed when I finally revealed that I did not have a Windows computer that he shouted: ""You've been wasting my time!""It seems I am not alone in this pursuit. There is a rebellion against these fraudsters and it is called scam-baiting, providing a valuable service by wasting their time.Wayne - not his real name - from the website Scam Survivors tells us that he started by responding to scam emails telling him that he had won some money. Then he graduated to romance scams, where people are fooled into handing over money in the belief that they have found their true love.Now he helps out people who come to the site to report that they or their relatives have been blackmailed, scamming the criminals into revealing more about their identity.Wayne says thousands of people are visiting his website every day looking for help. The internet has enabled all sorts of new forms of fraud but it is also helping people to fight back against the criminals."

Private companies will also be challenged.""For Taiwan, mainland China is viewed as one of the main sources of cyber-attacks on the island,"" commented Veerle Nouwens from the UK-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies.""The director-general of Taiwan's Cyber Security Agency has been quoted as saying that the Taiwanese government's networks receive an estimated 30 million attacks a month, about half of which are suspected to come from China.""However, irrespective of the originating country, strengthening cyber-security is increasingly a top priority for any government or private sector company.""The Cyber Offensive and Defensive Exercises (Code) were officially launched by the AIT's acting director, Raymond Greene, at an event hosted by Microsoft.He described the tests as marking a ""new frontier"" in cyber-co-operation between Washington and Taipei.""The biggest threats today are not troops landing on the beach but efforts by malign actors to use the openness of our societies and networks against us,"" said Mr Greene.""In many ways, cyber-threats are the most significant risk affecting all of us.""He added that attackers were seeking to undermine elections, compromise critical infrastructure and cripple financial trade.Officials from other countries, including Australia, Indonesia and Japan, are also taking part to challenge Taiwan's defences.The Code drills are based on a separate US-led international computer-attack simulation known as the Cyber Storm exercises, which are held every other year.According to the Global Taiwan Institute, the island had repeatedly asked to be involved in the last event in spring 2018 but was not invited to do so.""The announcement that the United States is participating in Taiwan's cyber-drills this year reflects the deepening of US-Taiwan security co-operation and dovetails other efforts under way between the United States and Japan to strengthen cyber-security co-operation,"" blogged the US-based institute's executive director, Russell Hsiao, last month.AIT plans to follow up this week's event with a ""road show"" in 2020, when it intends bring American cyber-security experts to Taiwan to host seminars at its science parks and other tech hubs.For its part, China has previously accused Taiwan of being involved in its own ""infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland""."
technology	Towards a lip-reading computer		"Scientists at Oxford say they've invented an artificial intelligence system that can lip-read better than humans.The system, which has been trained on thousands of hours of BBC News programmes, has been developed in collaboration with Google's DeepMind AI division.""Watch, Attend and Spell"", as the system has been called, can now watch silent speech and get about 50% of the words correct. That may not sound too impressive - but when the researchers supplied the same clips to professional lip-readers, they got only 12% of words right.Joon Son Chung, a doctoral student at Oxford University's Department of Engineering, explained to me just how challenging a task this is. ""Words like mat, bat and pat all have similar mouth shapes."" It's context that helps his system - or indeed a professional lip reader - to understand what word is being spoken.""What the system does,"" explains Joon, ""is to learn things that come together, in this case the mouth shapes and the characters and what the likely upcoming characters are.""The BBC supplied the Oxford researchers with clips from Breakfast, Newsnight, Question Time and other BBC news programmes, with subtitles aligned with the lip movements of the speakers. Then a neural network combining state-of-the-art image and speech recognition set to work to learn how to lip-read.After examining 118,000 sentences in the clips, the system now has 17,500 words stored in its vocabulary. Because it has been trained on the language of news, it is now quite good at understanding that ""Prime"" will often be followed by ""Minister"" and ""European"" by ""Union"", but much less adept at recognising words not spoken by newsreaders.A lot more work needs to be done before the system is put to practical use, but the charity Action on Hearing Loss is enthusiastic about this latest advance.""AI lip-reading technology would be able to enhance the accuracy and speed of speech to text,"" says Jesal Vishnuram, the charity's technology research manager. ""This would help people with subtitles on TV, and with hearing in noisy surroundings.""Right now the system has limitations - it can only operate on full sentences of recorded video. ""We want to get it to work in real time,"" says Joon Son Chung. ""As it keeps watching TV, it will learn."" And he says getting the system to work live is a lesser challenge than improving its accuracy.He sees all sorts of potential uses for this technology, from helping people to dictate instructions to their smartphones in noisy environments, to dubbing old silent films.In many cases, the AI lip-reading system could be used to improve the performance of other forms of speech recognition.Where the Oxford researchers and the hearing loss charity agree, is on the fact that this is not a case where AI is going to replace humans.Professional lip-readers need not fear for their jobs - but they can look forward to a time when technology helps them become a lot more accurate."
technology	'Sextortion botnet spreads 30,000 emails an hour’	'Day jobs'	A large-scale “sextortion” campaign is making use of a network of more than 450,000 hijacked computers to send aggressive emails, researchers have warned.The emails threaten to release compromising photographs of the recipient unless $800 (£628) is paid in Bitcoin.And they contain personal information - such as the recipient’s password - probably gathered from existing data breaches, to specifically target more than 27 million potential victims at a rate of 30,000 per hour.While analysis suggests a small fraction of targets have fallen for the ploy, one expert said such botnets still offered a great “return on investment” for cyber-criminals.“A botnet can be used for many, many things,” said Charles Henderson, from IBM’s X-Force Red security team. “This was just one task assigned to it.”Hard to traceA botnet is a network of computers taken over by hackers using malicious software typically spread via infected web pages or email attachments.They can carry out attacks spread across a wide number of machines, making it harder to disrupt and the attacker’s origins harder to trace.Security company Check Point said this latest sextortion attack used the Phorpiex botnet, active for more than a decade.Research head Yaniv Balmas said those whose computers - Windows or Mac - had been hijacked would probably not know.“Attackers are simply using the victims' computers as vessels,” he said.'Save Yourself'Spreading an email campaign across a botnet in this way would reduce the risk of the emails being flagged as spam - though it’s not clear how many were able to reach people’s inboxes.“The criminals are getting smart enough to use a larger botnet and sending fewer emails per machine,” said Mr Henderson, who was not involved in Check Point’s research but has observed the same botnet in operation.Experts advise using the latest versions of software - particularly web browsers, in this instance - to avoid being susceptible to this kind of attack.A typical email sent by the botnet - with the subject line: “Save Yourself” - will say: “My malware gave me full access to all your accounts (see password above), full control over your computer and it was possible to spy on you over your webcam.”The claim is not true but the emails include a genuine password associated with the target’s email address.“The attacker is saying, ‘Hey, we hacked your computer, we saw you doing this and that, and this proves it. This is your password’,” Mr Balmas said.Check Point monitored one Bitcoin wallet used to collect funds from the scam and found about 11 bitcoin - almost $100,000 - was collected in a five-month period.“Most people don't fall for sextortion scams,” Mr Balmas said. “But it’s the rule of big numbers. If I'm sending 100,000 sextortion emails, it’s enough that 100 people fall for the trap. I get my money.”He said it was likely the same botnet was being used to carry out other, more lucrative attacks, such as the theft of credit card details.“It’s not somebody doing this from his garage,” Mr Balmas said.“It’s a group of individuals doing this for their day jobs. This is their business.”Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk?	What is the scale of the attack?Is my computer at risk?How did the attack spread so fast?Why weren't people protected?Who was behind the attack?	"Experts are warning that there could be further ransomware cases this week after the global cyber-attack. So, what has happened and how can organisations and individuals protect themselves from such attacks?Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is ""unprecedented"", according to EU police body Europol.It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend.There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life.In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took.The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments - $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up.WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk.However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain.You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages.Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked.The UK's National Cyber Security Centre website contains advice on how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't.The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm.Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code.Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised.It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus.In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency.When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction.It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft.However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small.Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly.It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The ""kill switch"" that stopped it spreading - accidentally discovered by a security researcher - may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly.Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace.However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace."

technology	Computer pioneer Harry Huskey dies aged 101	Founding father	"Engineer Harry Huskey, who helped build many of the first ever computers, has died aged 101.Dr Huskey was a key member of the team that built the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (Eniac) which first ran in February 1946.Eniac is widely considered to be one of the first electronic, general purpose, programmable computers.Dr Huskey also helped complete work on the Ace - the Automatic Computing Engine - designed by Alan Turing.The Eniac was built at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1940s and, once complete, was more than 100ft (30m) long, weighed 30 tonnes, used 18,000 valves and 1,500 relays. Programming the massive machine to do different computational tasks involved rewiring its various units. Eniac was built to calculate the trajectory of shells for the US army.Dr Huskey became involved with the development effort to create Eniac soon after joining Pennsylvania to teach mathematics to Naval recruits. His task was to make the punched card reader for the machine work and to write technical manuals describing how to operate it.After the war, Dr Huskey travelled to the UK to help Alan Turing refine and complete the Ace. This was built at the National Physical Laboratory and in 1950, when it ran its first program, it was the fastest computer in the world.He also helped design and build two other machines - the Swac (Standards Western Automatic Computer) and the G-15 which, despite weighing almost a tonne. was known as a personal computer because it could be operated by one person.Dr Huskey spent his entire academic career involved with computing teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and was one of the founders of the computer science faculty at UC Santa Cruz.""Harry basically lived through and participated in the entire span of the history of electronic computing,"" Dag Spicer, a curator at the Computer History Museum, told the New York Times."
technology	'Sensitive US Army data 'exposed by online leak'	Travel costs	"The travel details of large numbers of US government and military personnel have been exposed in a data leak, a security company says.VPNMentor said 179GB of data had been accessible on an unsecured cloud server run by a travel services company.The AutoClerk database had contained sensitive information about serving soldiers and civilians, it saidThe data had now been locked down, after the US Department of Defense had intervened, VPNMentor said.The information exposed had included full names, birth dates, addresses, phone numbers and travel itinerary details, including details of flights to sensitive locations such as Moscow and Tel Aviv as well as arrival times at hotels and, in some cases, room numbers, VPNMentor said.Payment card numbers had been included but obscured with standard security systems.Researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar said they had found the exposed database, which provided an ""invaluable insight into the operations and activities of the US government and military personnel"", while carrying out a large-scale web scanning and mapping project.""For the US government, alarm bells should be ringing,"" said Mr Rotem and Mr Locar.Data on more than 100,000 other trips, booked by civilians, had also been exposed, they said.VPNMentor said it had notified AutoClerk about the data it had found but received no response.It had also contacted the US Computer Emergency Response Team and the US Department of Defense with its findings.And soon after officials at the Pentagon had been notified, access to the database had been locked.Neither AutoClerk, which handles itinerary and booking data for several hotel chains and other travel companies, nor parent company Best Western have responded to a BBC News request for comment.The data leak is the latest in a series to hit travel companies.Choice Hotels, Intercontinental, Radisson, Chinese hotel chain Huazhu, Hyatt, Hilton, Teletext Holidays and many others have all lost data or been hit by hackers.In July, the UK's information commissioner announced an intention to fine hotel chain Marriott £99m over a 2018 data breach that saw details on 339 million guests go astray."

technology	US hospitals turn away patients as ransomware strikes	Australian hospitals struck	"Three US hospitals have been forced to temporarily close their doors to ""all but the most critical new patients"" following a ransomware outbreak.""A criminal is limiting our ability to use our computer systems in exchange for an as-yet unknown payment,"" said DCH Health System.DCH operates the three affected hospitals in Alabama.One cyber-security expert said the groups using ransomware were becoming increasingly well organised.Computers at the DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, Fayette Medical Center and Northport Medical Center were infected with ransomware.The incident was first reported on 1 October.""We will continue to divert any new admissions, other than those that are critical, to other facilities,"" DCH said in its statement.Local ambulances have been asked to take patients to other local hospitals instead, where possible.Outpatients with appointments at any of the three hospitals were advised to call before attending them.However, elective procedures and surgery already scheduled for 2 October were planned to go ahead.It is not yet known what group or individual launched the ransomware.Separately, seven hospitals in Australia have also reported disruptive ransomware infections.""Some elective surgery and appointments have been cancelled,"" said Barwon Health, one hospital operator affected by the incident.The Government of Victoria said the seven hospitals were located in Gippsland and south-west Victoria.Multiple computer systems have had to be disconnected as a result, which has meant some patient record, booking and management services have been shut down.This could affect efforts to contact patients and schedule appointments, the Government of Victoria said: ""Where practical, hospitals are reverting to manual systems to maintain their services.""In cases where patient histories, charts, images and other information has been made unavailable, it may be necessary to reschedule some appointments, the authority added.Daniel Andrews, Premier of Victoria, told local media it could take ""weeks"" before the problems were fixed.The Victorian Government Cyber Incident Response Service has dealt with more than 600 cyber-attacks since July 2018.""Unfortunately the groups breaking into individual computers at organisations are becoming rapidly better at obtaining access across networks, and then causing chaos with a goal to being paid,"" said UK-based cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont.""This problem isn't going to go away,"" he added.He said organisations needed to review their security procedures and ensure that backups were in place - and also that such backups had been recently tested - so that data and systems could be restored in the event of a ransomware infection."
technology	Early computer rebuild wins conservation award	State secret	"An exhibit that demonstrates what it was like to programme one of the first computers has won the Tony Sale award for best computer conservation project.The award-winning interactive project recreates part of Eniac - the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.The massive machine built from 18,000 valves and 1,500 relays first ran a program in February 1946.The exhibit was created at the Heinz Nixdorf Museum Forum (HNF) in Germany.The award was set up in 2012 to honour the memory of the Tony Sale, a British pioneer of computer conservation who spent 15 years recreating the early Colossus computer.The 2016 winner was created by Dr Jochen Viehoff and Johannes Blobel for the HNF and is built of a simplified model of one small component of Eniac known as the accumulator. The original Eniac filled several rooms and weighed about 27 tonnes.The exhibit uses two accumulators, cables, relays and flashing lights to show how complicated it was to perform simple calculations on the early computer.Eniac was the second general-purpose electronic computer created in the 1940s and won wide acclaim because the machine that was first, called Colossus, remained a state secret until the 1970s.Prof Martin Campbell-Kelly from the University of Warwick, who headed the award's panel of judges, said the exhibit ""captured the essence"" of the Eniac.""The panel was particularly impressed at the thought and planning that went into making the reconstruction accessible to non-specialist audiences,"" he said.Visitors to the HNF would be ""captivated"" by the exhibit, he said.Previous winners include a virtual reconstruction of the German Z1 computer and a museum exhibit that explored the history of IBM's influential 1401 machine."
technology	Apple raises computer prices in UK		"Apple has increased the prices of its laptop and desktop computers in the UK by hundreds of pounds.On Thursday, the company unveiled new Macbook Pro laptops, with prices similar to the US after currency conversion and addition of UK VAT.But the company also increased the prices of its older computer products, including the three-year-old Mac Pro, by hundreds of pounds.One analyst said consumers should expect further price increases.""Apple has to recalibrate prices after significant currency fluctuations, and since the EU referendum, UK prices are out of sync with the dollar,"" said Patrick O'Brien, analyst at the Verdict Retail consultancy.""Apple has taken the hit up until now. While price increases won't look good to the consumer, it's difficult to blame Apple.""Once you strip out UK sales tax (VAT) and the currency conversion, the new UK prices could still be viewed as fair.""A number of technology companies have increased their prices in the UK, reflecting the lower value of the pound.Apple's least expensive laptop - the 13in Macbook Air, last updated in March 2015 - now costs £949, up from £849.Its Mac Pro desktop computer - last updated in December 2013 - now costs £2,999, up from £2,499.""Apple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business,"" the company told the BBC.""International prices are not always comparable to US suggested retail prices.""Rival Microsoft has already announced UK price increases for some of its business services.Earlier in October, the company said some service prices would go up by 22% in 2017, reflecting the pound's weakened value against the euro.""We periodically assess the impact of local pricing of our products and services to ensure there is reasonable alignment across the region and this change is an outcome of this assessment,"" the company said.Mr O'Brien said it was ""inevitable"" that more companies would increase the prices of products and services.""Retailers are struggling with increased costs to import goods, and it's something they cannot afford to swallow themselves,"" he told the BBC.""We will definitely see further price rises, so if people are in the market for big-ticket items such as laptops, it might be a wise idea to buy now rather than later."""
technology	Retro computer project directors row	'Irreconcilable differences'Legal proceedings	"The founders of a crowd-funded project to make a retro computer games console, backed by Spectrum inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, have distanced themselves from the company they used to run.Retro Computers has received £417,375 ($542,000) from an Indiegogo campaign.But former directors Paul Andrews and Chris Smith said they had been unable to answer backers' concerns and were now ""publicly distancing"" themselves.The company accused Mr Andrews and Mr Smith of developing a rival product.A company with a similar name, Retro Games Ltd, has a website registered to Mr Andrews.It has also attempted to crowd-fund a retro computer device - although its is based on the Commodore 64 - but failed to meet its target.Mr Andrews and Mr Smith said in a statement they had had no control of the Spectrum company, Retro Computers, since their resignation in April.However, the pair do retain a joint 50% shareholding.Mr Andrews and Mr Smith said they had received many emails from the project's backers questioning the production status of the Vega+ handheld console but had not been able to get answers from the company.In a joint statement, they said: ""Andrews and Smith therefore feel they have no choice but to publicly distance themselves from Retro Computers Ltd, and make it very clear that as they have no knowledge, control or say in anything that has happened in the company since they resigned on 8 April 2016, they are unable to answer any questions relating to the company or its projects.""Their resignation followed ""irreconcilable differences"" between the two men and company chairman Dr David Levy.On its crowd-funding campaign page, Retro Computers is urging concerned backers leaving comments to ""trust us for a little while longer"".Dr Levy said: ""The current team at Retro Computers Ltd has been and is focusing its efforts on the completion of new and better software for its forthcoming product, the Vega+, and is making every effort, supported by the factory, to deliver the first production run of the Vega+ by the end of next month, as originally planned.""BBC News approached Mr Andrews and Mr Smith for a comment.The Vega+ is not yet on the market, but promises to sport a colour LCD display and 1,000 pre-installed games.It is currently set to launch in September 2016, with an initial price tag of £100.It is based on the ZX Spectrum, a home computer released in 1982, which has been widely credited with launching the UK IT industry.Sir Clive Sinclair, founder of Sinclair Research, endorsed the Indiegogo campaign, which was launched in February."
technology	Leap second briefly catches out computer firm	Time lost	"Web firm Cloudflare was briefly caught out by the leap second added to the end of 2016.A small number of the firm's servers failed to handle the added second properly making them return errors.The problem meant that the sites of some of its customers were hard to reach in the early hours of 2017.The second was added to compensate for a slowdown in the earth's rotation and helps to co-ordinate time-keeping among nations that use GMT.In a statement, Cloudflare said that its engineers had fixed the problem within 90 minutes of it affecting its servers.Anyone falling victim would have got an error message saying servers could not be reached rather than seeing the page they wanted to visit.Content delivery firm Cloudflare acts as a go-between for websites aiming to speed up access to a site as well as stopping malicious traffic and attacks reaching that destination.It said that the problem affected about 1% of the requests its servers processed during the glitch period.A detailed analysis of why the bug emerged found that it was triggered by a mismatch between the time-stamps Cloudflare servers were expecting and the ones they actually got from the separate systems that keep time on the wider net.This caused an internal system to ""panic"" the firm wrote, causing the server errors."
technology	Micro Bit mini-computer heads overseas	Global ambitionWhat is a Micro Bit?UK expansionFemale appealEarly days	"The Micro Bit mini-computer is to be sold across the world and enthusiasts are to be offered blueprints showing how to build their own versions.The announcements were made by a new non-profit foundation that is taking over the educational project, formerly led by the BBC.About one million of the devices were given away free to UK-based schoolchildren earlier this year.The BBC says they encourage children, especially girls, to codeHowever, the delayed rollout of the machines to last year's Year 7s (11-to-12-year-olds) caused problems for teachers who had less time than expected to prepare related classes.Beyond the UK, Micro Bits are also in use in schools across the Netherlands and Iceland. But the foundation now intends to co-ordinate a wider rollout.""Our goal is to go out and reach 100 million people with Micro Bit, and by reach I mean affect their lives with the technology,"" said the foundation's new chief executive Zach Shelby.""That means [selling] tens of millions of devices... over the next five to 10 years.""His organisation plans to ensure Micro Bits can be bought across Europe before the end of the year and is developing Norwegian and Dutch-language versions of its coding web tools to boost demand.Next, in 2017, the foundation plans to target North America and China, which will coincide with an upgrade to the hardware.""We will be putting more computing power in,"" Mr Shelby said.""We will be looking at new types of sensors.""And also how to display Chinese and Japanese characters - it turns out you need a lot more LEDs than we have today.""We also have work to do to reduce the price for developing countries, that's something we're very aware of.""Micro Bits currently sell for about £13, excluding the batteries needed to power them.That makes them several times more expensive than another barebones computer - the Raspberry Pi Zero.But the foundation says they serve different audiences since the Micro Bit is designed for users with little or no coding knowledge when they begin.The Micro Bit is a palm-sized circuit board with an array of 25 LED lights - that can be programmed to show letters, numbers and other shapes - and a Bluetooth chip for wireless connectivity.It also includes two built-in buttons, an accelerometer and compass, and rings to which further sensors can be attached.Rather than enter code directly into the computer, owners instead write their scripts in a choice of four programming languages via web-based tools on a PC, or via an app on a tablet or smartphone.Once written, the compiled scripts must be transferred to the Micro Bit, which then functions as a standalone device that can be used to flash messages and record movements among other tasks.It can also be attached to other electronics to form the ""brain"" of a robot, a musical instrument or other kit.In addition, a new feature makes peer-to-peer communications possible, meaning one Micro Bit can now transmit data to another, opening up further possibilities.The foundation has also pledged to use some of its funds to sponsor Micro Bits for UK classrooms, so that more children get the chance to use them.However, for the most part, schools wanting to use them will need to pay for the units themselves.That is likely to require two or more pupils having to share a device in class rather than being given one of their own to take home, as had been the case.Older children are also being courted with the release of the Micro Bit's hardware design, so that they can build DIY models.""It will look different because building it yourself is not easy,"" said Mr Shelby.""We think that will get older kids and young adults interested in experimenting with electronics.""They can not just make a Micro Bit but modify one and make their own sensors.""Although the BBC is relinquishing control of the project, it will retain a seat on the foundation's board and the hardware will still be branded with its name.To mark the handover, the broadcaster released details of a survey that questioned 147 girls before they received a Micro Bit, and then a different group of 208 girls afterwards.It recorded that 23% of those without experience said they would ""definitely"" study computing in the future, but the figure grew to 39% for those who used a Micro Bit.""A lot of projects in Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] are oftentimes aimed at boys - rocket cars for example,"" commented Mr Shelby.""With Micro Bits there have been lots of projects that are really interesting to girls - they love music-based projects and making their own drawing games with it, for example - so it seems non-intimidating.""The Micro Bit's original release was delayed from October 2015 to March 2016, meaning teachers got them late in the school year.Some of those involved in the project believe it is too early to judge their impact fully as some recipients have only just started using them.""If we could have allowed the teachers to have them a couple of weeks before the students, that would have had a bigger impact,"" acknowledged Richard Needham, a consultant at Stem Learning - a firm that develops teaching resources.""Some schools found it quite difficult to manage because they were asked to distribute these but it wasn't clear who had ownership of them.""The BBC said they belonged to children and not teachers, but I do know in some schools the teachers hung on to them for a little bit longer to decide how they were going to distribute them.""I've heard of some rare examples where teachers only gave them out at the start of this school year, which was a disappointment, but understandable."""
technology	Robot hand solves Rubik’s cube, but not the grand challenge	'Showmanship'	"A remarkable robot, capable of solving a Rubik’s cube single-handedly, has demonstrated just how far robotics has advanced - but at the same time, experts say, how far we still have to go.OpenAI’s system used a computer simulation to teach the robot hand to solve the cube, running through routines that would take a single human some 10,000 years to complete.Once taught, the robot was able to solve a cube that had been slightly modified to help the machine tell which way up it was being held.Completion time varied, the research team said, but it generally took around four minutes to complete the task.Using machine-learning and robotics to solve a Rubik’s cube has been achieved before. Notably, in March 2018, a machine developed by engineers at MIT managed to solve a cube in just 0.38 seconds.What’s significant with OpenAI’s effort is the use of a multi-purpose robot, in this case a human-hand-like design, rather than a machine specifically designed to handle a Rubik’s cube and nothing else.“The ability to solve the Rubik’s cube in the real world, on a robot hand, is actually extremely difficult,” said Matthias Plappert, team leader for robotics at OpenAI, speaking to the BBC.“You need to very precisely control your fingers, you need to do it for a very long time without kind of messing up in between. and a lot of different things can happen in the process.”Mr Plappert hailed the team’s method of gradually injecting complications into the process - simulated hindrances that would force the robot to adapt in order to complete the cube.This technique - called automatic domain randomisation (ADR) - was used, the team said, to give the robot consistent, intricate dexterity that can handle changes in the environment that go beyond what a computer could predict and simulate.In a demonstration video posted on Tuesday, OpenAI demonstrated how adding difficulty for the robot - such as nudging the cube with a giraffe stuffed toy, or covering the cube with a black sheet - did not necessarily prevent the completion of the cube (though the hand did not have a 100% record, researchers said).While instinctive to humans, handling disruptions or complications, particularly when dealing with holding and manipulating objects, is seen as a grand challenge of robotics - a problem that will need to be solved if advanced robotics are to become commonplace in every home and business.“We use human hands for all kinds of things,” said Peter Welinder, also a team leader at OpenAI.“We use them to solve Rubik’s cubes, but we also use them for cooking meals. This is one of the reasons we picked the robotic hand, because it promises much more general purpose robots.“The big obstacle has been manipulation. So we took the Rubik's Cube as an example of really how far can we push manipulation.”But, argues Prof Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley, OpenAI’s research should not be overstated, despite being what he described as an impressive act of “showmanship”.“The average human isn't particularly good at solving Rubik’s cubes,” he told the BBC.“So when they see a robot doing it, they say, ‘well, this is better than a human’. But that's a little deceptive - because games are not reality.”He said OpenAI’s ADR technique was genuine progress, but handling items more complex and unpredictable than a Rubik’s cube will require more research.“Will we get to the point where a robot could pick up a deck of cards and shuffle them like a Las Vegas croupier? Or anyone who's reasonably good at doing that? That could be 10-20 years off.“We’re far from being able to replace kitchen workers who chop up vegetables, or even pick up and you know, do dishwashing. All those are very complex tasks.”The BBC has not been able to independently verify the performance of OpenAI’s robot. And, while details were not disputed by the experts the BBC spoke to, OpenAI’s research paper was not peer-reviewed.OpenAI was announced in October 2015, co-funded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, start-up specialist Sam Altman and other investors (though Mr Musk is no longer involved). Its goal was to further research in artificial intelligence, with a focus on a technique known as ""reinforcement learning"" - teaching AI with repetitive tasks and ""rewards"" for correct outcomes. OpenAI is seen as a key competitor to Google's Deepmind._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	'First Apple computer' sells for $815,000	'Manually soldered'Garlanded history	"A prototype Apple 1, a holy-grail item in electronics memorabilia, has been sold for $815,000 (£618,000).Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built just 200 of the computers in 1976.The model auctioned this week contains tell-tale signs that it is a prototype, probably made prior to its manufacturing run.One computer historian says it is ""one of the first, if not the first ever"" Apple computer.This ""celebration edition"" Apple 1 was expected to make $1m, but auctioneer Charitybuzz told the BBC that the final bid was $815,000.That means it is not the highest-grossing Apple 1 computer - that distinction belongs to a rare working version that sold for $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in October 2014.A spokeswoman for Charitybuzz said that ""about 80 bidders"" had been watching the item. She denied reports that there had been a last-minute $1.2m bid, apparently made too late to be accepted.Ten percent of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, based in New York, Charitybuzz said.The winning bidders, Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, said they want to take the computer into schools and universities to help inspire young people.Mr Dellimore told the BBC: ""It is incredible to think that this was most likely the very first Apple 1, the unicorn or holy grail of computers, the original very first prototype.""No more than 70 Apple 1 computers are believed to still be in existence. The machine - initially named ""Apple Computer 1"" - first went on sale in July 1976, and was discontinued in October of the following year when the company turned its attention to building the Apple 2.The ""celebration edition"" is different from the other Apple 1s because it was manually soldered on to a blank PC board, meaning it was not part of the only two production runs of the device.Mr Wozniak was quoted by Charitybuzz as saying: ""Only a few Apple 1s, on blank (not green) PC boards, may have been manually soldered, although I'm not sure of it.""We arranged the wave soldering with the company that made the PC boards. But we may not have wanted to wave solder a run (of maybe 10 or more board) until we manually soldered one or two to debug them.""Apple historian Corey Cohen, who assessed the machine, said in a promotional video that the celebration edition is ""one of the first, if not the first, Apple computers because this appears to be one of the sample boards"".According to a timestamp on the PC board, it was made in the summer of 1976.Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple on 1 April 1976 in California in the garage of Paul and Clara Jobs.The trio's first major project was the Apple 1 computer, which was first unveiled at the Homebrew Computer Club - a hobbyist group in Silicon Valley.To help finance the machine's production, Jobs sold his VW Microbus, while Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500.The Apple 1 went on sale in July 1976 at a price of $666.66.About 175 of the 200 units were sold, while the remaining units were destroyed.Two weeks after Apple's formation, Mr Wayne sold his 10% stake for $800.The company's annual revenue last year was $234bn."
technology	Can a computer copy your handwriting?	Handy writing	"Researchers at University College London have taught a computer to imitate anyone's handwriting.They have created an algorithm that can take a sample of handwritten text, examine its qualities, and then write any text in the same style.There are already typefaces in word processing programs that produce text in a fairly uniform handwritten style. But what Tom Haines and his fellow UCL researchers have done is create software that they claim reproduces the messy details of any individual writer's hand.They call their system My Text In Your Handwriting and have tried it out on samples of handwritten text from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln and the creator of Sherlock Holmes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.While Conan Doyle never actually wrote ""Elementary, my dear Watson..."" the UCL team have now produced that sentence in his handwriting.I gave Tom Haines a uniquely difficult challenge.My handwriting has always been bad. A messy scrawl that even my family struggles to decipher. I supplied Tom with a sample written on paper with a ballpoint pen - other programs have relied on text written on a tablet, which gives a less accurate input.He began the process by using a program that marked up each letter and punctuation mark, analysing in some detail how I wrote. The fact that I sometimes dotted the letter i and in other cases did not was just one wrinkle.Then when the analysis was complete he fed it into the algorithm and typed the word ""hello"" into a box.Alongside, a barely legible ""hello"" appeared - but I had to admit it was a fair approximation of my scrawl. We then tried it out with a whole sentence - and again I have to admit the result was just as bad as I might have produced.Clever - but what practical uses does this handwriting algorithm have?One example is where banks send out sensitive documents or new credit cards and want to disguise the letters so that they look like handwritten personal letters. The researchers showed me three hand-addressed letters - one of them produced by the computer, two genuinely hand-written. I struggled to work out which was which - see if you can do any better.Another possible commercial use is in the personal messages that are inserted with flowers or presents sent by delivery firms - how much better to have a ""genuine"" handwritten ""Happy Birthday"" than something typed on a card.You might think that another potential use was by criminals attempting to forge your signature. But the researchers say that close examination with a microscope will still reveal what was written by a real human being and what was machine-generated.Image 2 was done by computer but the other two were written by a human."
technology	Stalkerware: The software that spies on your partner	Put to the test	"Amy says it all started when her husband seemed to know intimate details about her friends.""He would drop snippets into conversations, such as knowing about Sarah's baby. Really private things that he shouldn't have known about. If I asked how he knew these things, he'd say I'd told him and accuse me of losing it,"" she says.Amy - not her real name - also began to wonder how he seemed to know where she was all the time.""Sometimes he would say he saw me at a cafe where I was meeting my friends and say he was just passing by chance. I started to question everything and trust no-one, even my friends,"" she says.For months, these incidents built up, turning an abusive marriage into a nightmare that came to a chilling conclusion after a Halloween family trip.""We'd been to visit a pumpkin patch and were having a rare good weekend, which basically means my husband hadn't taken anything out on me. Our six-year-old son was playing on the floor and was so happy,"" Amy says.""My husband passed me his phone to show me a picture he'd taken at the farm and in that split-second I saw an alert pop up on his screen. It read, 'Daily report on Amy's Mac is ready to view.'""I felt this chill go through me and I stopped breathing for a minute. I had to excuse myself and pretended I needed the bathroom. I had to be there for my son and pretend that I hadn't seen anything.""The first moment I could, I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware he'd used. That's when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy.""Stalkerware - also known as spouseware - are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online.On a device, all messages can be read, screen activity recorded, GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing.Tips to avoid being victimised:Don’t leavedevice unattended – most software requires physical accessDitch fingerprintlock - a partner can use your print while you sleepAdd security app- antivirus software can also detect spyware and remove itAccording to cyber-security company Kaspersky, the number of people who have discovered such software on their devices has risen by at least 35% in the past year.Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37,532 devices so far this year.And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the ""tip of a very large iceberg"".""Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop, not that many people actually protect a mobile device,"" he says.""This information is coming back from installations of our product on [smartphones]... so this figure doesn't even go close to what the total would be.""Kaspersky's findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity. India, Brazil, the United States and Germany complete the top five, with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections.Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on.""It's always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them,"" says Jake Moore, from Eset.""As a general rule, if you aren't using an app, delete it.""Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised, she developed a severe mistrust of technology, which she is only just overcoming.Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma.Jessica was another victim of stalkerware. Her ex-husband routinely spied on her through her phone's microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations.It's been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends.Gemma Toynton, from domestic abuse charity Safer Places, says she see this long-term effect a lot in her cases.""It reduces someone's trust,"" she says. ""It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon, because that's what it's been used for.""Technology has become, in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet.""It really does impact your whole life. The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern.""Amy, who is from the US, is now divorced and lives many miles away from her ex-husband.She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their son's care via written letter only.I tested out one of the most popular consumer products, which costs £140 for three months of surveillance.I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone. It took me about an hour and I used the 24-hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems.Spyware companies advertise their services as ""employee monitoring"" or ""parental control"" products.In many countries, including the UK, using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal, so many of the companies' websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this.However, some of the same websites link to articles, seemingly written by associates, recommending the software as a spy tool for ""cheatings wives and husbands"".In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing, I directly told them: ""I want to install this on my wife's phone, will it be secret?""The customer service-representative responded: ""The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation. I'll be happy to help.""I also downloaded five of the top cyber-security products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan.All of them gave alerts for ""potentially harmful software"".The Crown Prosecution Service says there aren't specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies.""They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability,"" she says.""There is a wink that's given when they send this little disclaimer that says, 'We don't approve of you spying on wives.' They know what their customers are doing though. This software causes real harm."""
technology	Programming in the early days of the computer age	Thinking timeNight work	"Everyone remembers the first computer they ever used. And Joyce Wheeler is no exception. But in her case the situation was a bit different. The first computer she used was one of the first computers anyone used.The machine was Edsac - the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator - that ran for the first time in 1949 and was built to serve scientists at the University of Cambridge.Joyce Wheeler was one of those scientists who, at the time, was working on her PhD under the supervision of renowned astronomer Fred Hoyle.""My work was about the reactions inside stars,"" she said. ""I was particularly interested in how long main sequence stars stay on their main sequence.""I wanted to know how long a star took to fade out,"" she explained.The inner workings of the nuclear furnace that keep stars shining is an understandably knotty problem to solve. And, she said, the maths describing that energetic process were formidable.""For stars, there's a rather nasty set of differential equations that describe their behaviour and composition,"" she added.Completing those calculations manually was futile.""It was not possible to be really accurate doing it by hand,"" she said. ""The errors just build up too much.""Enter Edsac - a machine created by Prof Maurice Wilkes to do exactly the kind of calculations Ms Wheeler (nee Blackler) needed done to complete her advanced degree.First though, she had to learn to write the programs that would carry out the calculations.Dr Wheeler started her PhD work at Cambridge in 1954 knowing about Edsac thanks to an earlier visit during which the machine had been shown off to her and others.Keen to get on with her research she sat down with the slim booklet that described how to program it and, by working through the exercises in that pioneering programming manual, learned to code.The little book was called WWG after its three authors Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler and Stanley Gill.It was through learning programming that Ms Blackler got talking to David Wheeler because one of her programs helped to ensure Edsac was working well. They got to know each other, fell in love and married in 1957.Now, more than 62 years on she is very matter of fact about that time - even though programmers, and especially women programmers, were rare.Perhaps because of that novel situation, a new discipline and a pioneering machine, the atmosphere at Cambridge in the computer lab was not overwhelmingly masculine.""You could be regarded as a bit of an object, and occasionally it was a bit uncomfortable,"" she said, ""But it was not quite a boys' brigade then in the way that it became later on.""It was an exciting time, she said, because of what the machine could do for her and her work. She took to programming quickly, she said, her strength with maths helping her quickly master the syntax into which she had to translate those ""nasty equations"".""But it was like maths,"" she said, ""it was one of those things that you knew you should not do for too long.""I found I could not work at a certain programming job for more than a certain number of hours per day,"" she said. ""After that you would not make much progress.""Often, she said, the solution to a programming problem she had been worrying away at would strike while she was engaged in something more mundane, like doing the washing or eating lunch.""Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming.""With the programming done, she could let Edsac do the number crunching. As a research student she had to run her programs during the night. In her case that was Friday.""That was good because there were no lectures the next day that you had to go to,"" she said.As an operator she was allowed to run Edsac alone, provided she signed in and kept a record of what she did.""Quite often it would break down during the night, but just occasionally you were lucky enough to keep it running all night,"" she said. ""If it did crash, there was little that operators were allowed to do to try to fix it.""They didn't even let any of the cleaners get near it,"" she said.Dr Wheeler had been shown one procedure that recalibrated Edsac's two kilobyte memory but if that did not help, then her work would stop for the night.Despite the regular crashes, Ms Wheeler made steady progress on finding out how long different stars would last before they collapsed.""I got some estimates of a star's age, how long it was going to last,"" she said. ""One of the nice things was that with programming you could repeat it. Iterate. You could not do that with a hand calculation.""We could add in sample numbers on programs and it could easily check them,"" she added. ""I could check my results on the machine very rapidly, which was very useful.""Rapidly in the 1950s meant about 30 minutes for the machine to complete one run of a program. Then the results were printed out for researchers to pore over to see what results they had got. Then it was a case of re-programming and perhaps waiting a few days to have a chance to run a slightly modified program on Edsac.Despite the delays, it was clear to Dr Wheeler that they were pioneers.""We were doing work that could not done in any other way,"" she said. And even though Edsac was crude and painfully slow by modern standards, she saw that a revolution had begun.""It was clear that one day, when the machines got bigger and faster, a lot of problems would start to be solved."""
technology	Computing in schools in 'steep decline'	'Disenfranchised'	"An annual study by the University of Roehampton has found that fewer 16-year-olds in England are getting a computing qualification.It also said schools have cut back on the hours spent teaching the subject.In 2018, 130,000 students got a GCSE in either computer science or ICT (information and communications technology), down from 140,000 the previous year.This year, the ICT exam is not an option.The fall in exam passes follows the phasing out of the ICT GCSE from the national curriculum in England and its replacement by the more challenging computer science.However, with entries for computer science growing only slowly it looks certain that far fewer 16-year-olds will emerge with any computing qualification.The study says the provision of computing education is ""in steep decline"", with the number of hours of computing taught in English secondary school classrooms falling by 31% between 2012 and 2017.The report's authors say that for the majority of school students who do not opt to take the computer science GCSE it now looks unlikely that they will be getting any computing education in schools beyond the age of 14.""It looks likely that hundreds of thousands of students, particularly girls and poorer students, will be disenfranchised from a digital education over the next few years,"" said Peter Kemp, senior lecturer in computing education at the University of Roehampton.Sixty-one per cent of schools offered the computer science GCSE as an option in 2018, a modest rise on the previous year.But a number of schools where it had previously been an option dropped it last year, among them a number of girls-only comprehensives and grammar schools.Another of the report's authors, Miles Berry, says the new GCSE has got a reputation for being harder than other subjects, and that has proved off-putting to less academic students.""Even among the academically strong, privileged intake, performance is typically below that of students' other subjects, and thus students, their parents and their head teachers might understandably take the view that this is not an easy way to get top grades,"" he said.The old ICT course got a bad reputation for giving children few skills apart from how to set up a spreadsheet or make a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.Universities complained that students were applying to study computing having not even learned basic programming at school.The spread of code clubs, the birth of the Raspberry Pi project and the new computer science exam were all sparked by anxiety about the level of computing education in schools.The Department for Education said the government had acknowledged the importance of computing by making it a compulsory part of the national curriculum.""We are investing £84m over the next four years to up-skill up to 8,000 computer science teachers and drive up participation in computer science,"" said a spokesperson."
technology	China builds world's most powerful computer		"A new supercomputer from China has topped the latest list of the world's most powerful machines.The 93 petaflop Sunway TaihuLight is installed at the National Supercomputing Centre in Wuxi.At its peak, the computer can perform around 93,000 trillion calculations per second.It is twice as fast and three times as efficient as the previous leader Tianhe-2, also from China, said Top500 which released the new list on Monday.Its main applications include advanced manufacturing, weather forecasting and big data analytics, wrote Jack Dongarra in a paper about the new machine.It has more than 10.5 million locally-made processing cores and 40,960 nodes and runs on a Linux-based operating system.For the first time since the list began, China has overtaken the US with 167 computers in the top 500 while the US has 165.""Considering that just 10 years ago, China claimed a mere 28 systems on the list, with none ranked in the top 30, the nation has come further and faster than any other country in the history of supercomputing,"" said Top500.The US has four supercomputers in the top 10 of the Top500 list, while China has two which currently occupy the top two places.The other positions in the top 10, published twice a year, are occupied by machines from Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Saudi Arabia.""As a computer scientist it's difficult writing software that can take advantage of and control large numbers of computer cores,"" said Professor Les Carr from the University of Southampton.""This is why supercomputers are restricted to specialised applications - you need very specialised computing needs to take advantage of them.""They are like extremely high-spec Grand Prix racing cars - they are fantastic for racing on circuits but they're not great for travelling from London to Edinburgh."""
technology	Elon Musk and Jack Ma disagree about AI's threat	Less work	"Alibaba's Jack Ma and Tesla's Elon Musk took opposing views of the risks and potential rewards of artificial intelligence at an event in Shanghai.The Chinese entrepreneur said he was ""quite optimistic"" about AI and thought it was nothing for ""street smart"" people like them to be scared of.""I don't know man, that's like famous last words,"" responded Tesla's chief.Mr Musk added that technology was evolving faster than our ability to understand it.The two did, however, agree on one topic: that one of the biggest problems the world is facing is population collapse.The businessmen are two of the most influential tech leaders shaping the world today.US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he has since broken ties with it.Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as well as via investments in dozens of third-party companies.Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to become the world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030.Mr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think.""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained.Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks.""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said.""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years.""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys.""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs.""By contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern.""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed.""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software.""He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life.""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained.""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start.""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there.""To avoid such a fate, he said we needed to find a way to connect our brains to computers so that we could ""go along for the ride with AI"" - something he is trying to achieve via one of his latest start-ups.Otherwise, he cautioned, AI would become weary of trying to communicate with humans, as we would be much slower thinkers in comparison.""Human speech to a computer will sound like very slow tonal wheezing, kind of like whale sounds,"" Mr Musk explained.""What's our bandwidth? Like a few hundred bits per second, basically, maybe a few kilobits per second, if you're going to be generous.""Whereas a computer can easily communicate at a terabit level. So, the computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It'll be like talking to a tree - that's humans.""It will be barely getting any information out.""By contrast, Mr Ma acknowledged that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time.""Don't worry about the machines,"" he said.""For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man.""A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy.""Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from.""Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become ""more creative and constructive"", he concluded that ""my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter"".Mr Musk responded: ""Yeah, definitely not.""It's going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,"" he added.""In fact, there's a strong argument, we're in the simulation right now.""Towards the end of the event the two men came together on one point - that concerns about overpopulation were misguided.""Assuming... there's a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,"" said Mr Musk""I want to emphasise this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse.""Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement.""One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we'll see this thing bring big trouble to China,"" he said.""And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you've got a collapse.""However, he suggested, using AI to help people live longer, healthier lives could be part of the solution."
technology	Elon Musk reveals brain-hacking plans	Merging with AI	"NeuraLink, a company set up by Elon Musk to explore ways to connect the human brain to a computer interface, has applied to US regulators to start trialling its device on humans.The system has been tested on a monkey that was able to control a computer with its brain, according to Mr Musk.The firm said it wanted to focus on patients with severe neurological conditions.But ultimately Mr Musk envisions a future of ""superhuman cognition"".The device the firm has developed consists of a tiny probe containing more than 3,000 electrodes attached to flexible threads - thinner than a human hair - which can then monitor the activity of 1,000 neurons.The advantage of this system, according to the firm, is that it would be able to target very specific areas of the brain, which would make it surgically safer. It would also be able to analyse recordings using machine learning, which would then work out what type of stimulation to give a patient.NeuraLink did not explain how the system translated brain activity or how the device was able to stimulate brain cells.""It's not like suddenly we will have this incredible neural lace and will take over people's brains,"" Mr Musk said during his presentation. ""It will take a long time.""But he said, for those who choose it, the system would ultimately allow for ""symbiosis with artificial intelligence"".Previously Mr Musk has suggested that AI could destroy the human race.""Even in a benign AI scenario, we will be left behind,"" he said.""With a high bandwidth brain machine interface, we can go along for the ride and effectively have the option of merging with AI.""Connecting the brain to an interface would create a new layer of ""superintelligence"" in the human brain, he added, something people ""already have via their phones"".Later, during a question and answer session, he revealed that the device NeuraLink is working on has been tested on monkeys, with the animal able to control a computer with its brain, according to Mr Musk.Now the firm is putting together a submission to start human testing, which will need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.Mr Musk is also looking to recruit more scientists to the firm, which currently has about 100 employees.NeuraLink released a paper to coincide with the announcement, but it has not been peer-reviewed, something that is generally seen as a crucial part of any new scientific breakthrough.Krittika D'Silva, an AI researcher at the Frontier Development Lab, a partnership with Nasa attended the event, and said: ""The technology described by NeuraLink is exciting because it is significantly less invasive than prior work in this field.""The plans they describe will require many years of work to deal with technical and ethical challenges, but the technology could be a big step in working to alleviate certain serious medical conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson's.""The Kording Lab Twitter account, for scientists from the University of Pennsylvania's neuroscience department, tweeted that there was ""nothing revolutionary but a range of really creative ideas"" which seemed to suggest the firm was ""on a great track"".Andrew Hires. assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Southern California, tweeted that the company had ""pushed forward"" the best of existing lab technology.NeuraLink is not the only firm building neural interfaces. Kernel, set up by tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, is attempting similar things to ""radically improve and expand human cognition"".Many of Mr Musk's ventures push at the boundaries of what is currently possible. Space X is exploring missions to Mars, while his Boring Company is looking to build tunnels underneath Los Angeles, and his Hyperloop project aims to reinvent travel."
technology	Huge home-built computer used for Tetris		"A man has finished building an enormous computer in the sitting room of his bungalow in Cambridge.James Newman started work on the ""Megaprocessor"", which is 33ft (10m) wide and 6ft (2m) high, in 2012.It does the job of a chip-sized microprocessor and Mr Newman has spent £40,000 ($53,000) creating it.It contains 40,000 transistors, 10,000 LED lights and it weighs around half a tonne (500kg). So far, he has used it to play the classic video game Tetris.In a video demonstration he admits the game isn't easy to play.Mr Newman, a digital electronics engineer, started the project because he was learning about transistors and wanted to visualise how a microprocessor worked. The components all light up as the huge device carries out a task.""The machine on your desk may be a million times better than what I have built - but mine is much prettier,"" he told the BBC.""Mine has 10,000 times more LEDs.""Mr Newman hopes the Megaprocessor will be used as an educational tool and is planning a series of open days at his home over the summer.""I doubt I'll be able to sell it,"" he said.""My dream is that it goes to a museum or educational institute so that people can learn from it."""
technology	The Chinese suicides prevented by AI from afar	Long journey	"Li Fan, a 21-year-old student, attempted suicide after posting a brief message on the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo just after Valentine's Day.""I can't go on anymore. I'm going to give up,"" he wrote.Soon after, he lost consciousness.He was in debt, had fallen out with his mother and was suffering from severe depression.Some 8,000km (5,000 miles) away from his university in Nanjing, his post was detected by a program running on a computer in Amsterdam.It flagged the message, prompting volunteers from different parts of China into action.When they were unable to rouse Mr Li from afar, they reported their concerns to local police, who eventually saved him.It might sound extraordinary but this was just one of many such success for the Tree Hole Rescue team.The initiative's founder is Huang Zhisheng, a senior artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at the Free University Amsterdam.In the past 18 months, his program has been used by 600 volunteers across China, who in turn say they have rescued nearly 700 people.""If you hesitate for a second, a lot of life will be lost,"" Mr Huang told BBC News.""Every week, we can save around 10 people.""The first rescue operation was on 29 April 2018.A 22-year-old college student, Tao Yue, in northern China's Shandong province, wrote on Weibo she planned to kill herself two days later.Peng Ling, a volunteer from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and several others reacted.Ms Peng told BBC News they had found a phone number for one of student's friends via an earlier post and passed the information to the college.""I tried to message her before sleep and told her that I could pick her up,"" she said.""She added me as a friend on [Chinese app] WeChat and gradually calmed down.""Since then, I have kept check on her to see if she is eating. We also buy her a bunch of flowers through the internet once a week.""After this success, the team rescued a man who had tried to jump off a bridge and saved a woman who had tried to kill herself after being sexually abused.""Rescues need both luck and experience,"" said Li Hong, a Beijing psychologist who has been involved for about a year.She recalled how she and her colleagues had visited eight hotels in Chengdu, in order to locate a suicidal woman they had known had booked a room in the city.""All the receptionists said they didn't know the woman,"" Ms Li said.""But one of them hesitated for a moment. We assumed it must be that hotel - and it was.""So how does the system work?The Java-based program monitors several ""tree holes"" on Weibo and analyses the messages posted there.A ""tree hole"" is the Chinese name for places on the net where people post secrets for others to read.The name is inspired by an Irish tale about a man who confided his secrets to a tree.One example is a post by Zou Fan, a 23-year old Chinese student who wrote a message on Weibo before killing herself, in 2012.After her death, tens of thousands of other users added comments to her post, writing about their own troubles, thus turning the original message into a ""tree hole"".The AI program automatically ranks the posts it finds from one to 10.A nine means there is a strong belief a suicide attempt will be made shortly. A 10 means it is likely to be already under way.In these cases, volunteers try to call the police directly and/or contact the person involved's relatives and friends.But if the ranking is below six - meaning only negative words have been detected - the volunteers normally do not intervene.One of the issues commonly encountered by the team is a belief among older relatives that depression is not a ""big deal.""""I knew I had depression when I was in high school but my mother told me that it was 'absolutely impossible - don't think about it anymore',"" Mr Li told BBC News.The AI program also found a post from a young woman, saying: ""I will kill myself when New Year comes.""But when the volunteers contacted her mother, they said she had sneered and said: ""My daughter was very happy just now. How dare you say she is planning suicide.""Even after the volunteers showed evidence of her daughter's depression, the mother did not take the matter seriously.It was only after an incident in which the police had to stop the youngster jumping off a rooftop that the mother changed her mind.Despite its successes, Mr Huang acknowledges the limits of his project.""Because Weibo limits the use of web crawlers, we can only gather around 3,000 entries every day,"" he said.""So we can only save one or two a day on average and we choose to focus on the most urgent cases.""Another issue is that some of those rescued require a long-term commitment.""Most of my life now is occupied by these rescued people,"" Ms Li said.""Sometimes I get very tired.""She said she was currently in contact with eight people who had been rescued.""I have to reply [to] them soon after they send me a message,"" she said.Some team members also try to provide help offline.For example, one AI professor is said to have found a data-labelling job for one person found to have a social-anxiety disorder.There is also the issue that suicidal thoughts can return.Ms Peng gave the example of one youngster who had ""looked better each day"" after being rescued but then killed herself.""She was talking to me about getting a new photo portrait on Friday,"" Ms Peng said, adding that two days later the woman was dead.""It's a big shock to me that a person you got along with over a long time suddenly isn't there.""By contrast, Mr Li remains healthy and now works at a hotel.""I like this job because I can communicate with many different people,"" he said.He added while he was very appreciative of the rescue team's efforts, ultimately it was up to each individual to achieve a long-term solution.""Different people's joys and sorrows are not completely interlinked,"" he said.""You must redeem yourself.""Illustration designed by Davies SuryaAt the request of the interviewees, the names of the rescued people involved have been changed.If you have been affected by self-harm, mental health issues or emotional distress, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line."
technology	Micro Bit computer becomes a commercial product		"The BBC Micro Bit, the tiny computing device designed to get children coding, is going on sale to the general public.The device is already being delivered, free, to one million Year 7 children in schools across the UK.Now it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for £12.99.Commercial availability of the Micro Bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device's manufacturer, the Leeds-based company, element 14.The firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90.But retailers including Microsoft, the Technology Will Save Us organisation and Sciencescope will offer individual devices.Element 14 is part of Premier Farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful Raspberry Pi barebones computer. Richard Curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the Micro Bit.""It's going to be huge,"" he told me.""We've already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who've seen what has happened in the UK.""The Micro Bit was meant to be the flagship of the BBC's Make It Digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. It started arriving in schools this spring and the BBC says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 Year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds).While I have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers.A number have told me that the Micro Bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - ""starting after half term, it's come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures"" was one comment this morning.But another teacher said this: ""Got ours just before Easter hols. Kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc.""It is late in the year - although the Micro Bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays.The hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join Year 8 in September, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then.The real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next Year 7 children will benefit from getting their own Micro Bits.They could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again.Element 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy.The Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices.But if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one.Update:The BBC told me that the licensing fee paid by Element 14 would in fact go back to the corporation and not a charitable trust."

technology	AI pilot 'sees' runway and lands automatically		"An automatic pilot has landed a plane using image-recognition artificial intelligence to locate the runway.At large airports, systems on the ground beam up the position of the runway to guide automatic systems.But in late May a new AI tool landed a small plane carrying passengers, by ""sight"" alone at Austria's Diamond Aircraft airfield.One expert said it could potentially improve flight safety.The new system, developed by researchers at the technical universities of Braunschweig and Munich, processes visual data of the runway and then adjusts the plane's flight controls, without human assistance.Because it can detect both infrared light as well as the normal visible spectrum, it can handle weather conditions such as fog that might make it difficult for the human pilot to make out the landing strip.Another advantage of the technology is it does not rely on the radio signals provided by the existing Instrument Landing System (ILS). Smaller airports often cannot justify the cost of this equipment and it can suffer from interference.The innovation might soon become part of a ""portfolio"" of systems that helped to improve flight safety, said Dr David Leslie, at the Alan Turing Institute.Battista Biggio, at the University of Cagliari, said there was a possibility that someone could attempt to sabotage the AI.This might be done by placing markings on the ground to try and trick the AI pilot into thinking a runway was present when one was not, for example.Dr Leslie said he felt the risk was minimal.""Automation doesn't necessarily mean that the pilot would be any less in control of the flight, it could mean that they're more well supported by the technologies to land the plane,"" he said.Boeing completed a fully autonomous landing of a passenger aircraft earlier this year - but the plane was not carrying any actual human passengers at the time."
technology	German nuclear plant hit by computer viruses	No damage	"Computer viruses have infected PCs used at a German nuclear power plant.The viruses were found on office computers and in a system used to model the movement of nuclear fuel rods.Power firm RWE said the infection posed no threat to the plant because its control systems were not linked to the internet, so the viruses could not activate.German federal cyber investigators are now analysing how the Gundremmingen plant became infected.The viruses were found on the fuel rod modelling system and on 18 USB sticks used as removable data stores on office computers.Staff found the viruses as they prepared to upgrade the computerised control systems for the plant's Block B, which is currently not producing power while it undergoes scheduled maintenance.More than 1,000 computers have now been checked for infection and cleaned up, an RWE spokesman told newspaper Die Zeit. The plant has also improved its security controls.No system directly involved with the control of the nuclear reactors was infected, RWE said, and there was no danger to the public as a result of the infection.""All sensitive plant areas are decoupled and designed with redundancy and protected against manipulation,"" added RWE in a statement.Among the viruses were two well-known malicious programs - W32.Ramnit and Conficker.Ramnit debuted in 2010 and is a remote access tool that its creators use to steal data. Conficker dates from 2008 and aims to grab login names and financial data.Because the infected systems were isolated from the net, neither Ramnit nor Conficker were able to activate, update and steal data, said RWE.Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said power plants and other chunks of a nation's critical infrastructure were often infected by viruses but such compromises did little damage.""The most common viruses spread without much awareness of where they are,"" he told Reuters.Gundremmingen is about 120km (75m) northwest of Munich and the plant is Gemany's highest output power station."
technology	Volunteers aid pioneering Edsac computer rebuild	Instruction setComing together	"Think of a shed and objects like spades, forks and compost in a wooden hut at the end of the garden come to mind.However, in the UK, some very old hardware is being brought back to life in some of those scruffy, but often well-organised, workspaces. In them, a group of veteran engineers is toiling to help recreate the pioneering Edsac computer.Designed by Sir Maurice Wilkes, Edsac first ran in 1949 and was made to serve scientists at the University of Cambridge. It helped them push the boundaries of their disciplines by giving them a tool that could crunch numbers faster than they could ever manage.""The problems they were tackling were not practical using hand-based calculation methods,"" said James Barr, one of the veterans reconstructing the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator.Edsac quickly proved its usefulness and helped two Cambridge scientists win Nobel prizes.But while the science was meticulously recorded, the building of Edsac was not.""Wilkes was exposed to electronics and valves during his wartime work on radar and to the mercury delay lines it used for memory,"" said Mr Barr. ""He had the technology in his head that he thought he could realise.""Wilkes' design for Edsac have been largely lost and, even if they could be found, that might not have helped because the machine changed as it was being built.That, said Mr Barr, left the Edsac reconstruction project with a big problem. Namely, they did not have a clear idea of how the thing was wired up.The project to recreate Edsac was undertaken to help fill gaps in knowledge about the way that this early British computer was built and worked. Once complete it will become a living exhibit at The National Museum of Computing where it will be used to help teach schoolchildren about programming.The early months of the reconstruction scheme were taken up studying photographs of the finished computer to try to work out how its 3,000 valves were laid out and how they formed the logic that lent the machine its computational power.Latterly, some plans for Edsac were discovered and have helped the builders confirm they were heading in the right direction. However, said Mr Barr, they turned up long after the heavy mental work had been done to understand the machine.""It took me a year to understand its five-bit order code,"" said Mr Barr. But understand it he did and his insights, along with those from fellow engineers who have worked on other key parts of the machine, has helped the project recreate Edsac's innards.Which is where the sheds come in.Those logical parts are being turned into hardware, known as chassis, in sheds and attics up and down the country. This has involved huge amounts of work as Edsac is built of 140 chassis spread around a series of tall racks. Each one is about 80cm long by 60cm wide, studded with valve sockets and stands in front of a spider's dream of wiring.""The practical reality is that the construction effort is quite significantly painstaking and it takes 20 to 40 man hours per chassis,"" he said.This wiring work is so mentally draining that Mr Barr and his fellow volunteers can only work on a chassis for a couple of hours at a time.""I didn't know what I was getting into when I volunteered but I've loved it,"" said Mr Barr, who got involved after seeing a poster about the Edsac reconstruction when visiting The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.Mr Barr studied at Cambridge during the 1970s and was lectured by many of the men who built Edsac, including Wilkes. He has dubbed his back garden work space the ""Edshack"" to honour this connection.""I thought I had to get involved as much as a homage to Maurice Wilkes and to give something back because they have given so much to me, really,"" he said. ""They set me up for a lifetime career of well-paid work and I was very grateful to them.""About 60% of the chassis have now been finished, said Mr Barr, and that means the project can move on to its next phase - getting all those separate parts to work together. ""It's not easy,"" he said.In some respects, the modern-day team is facing the same problems that the pioneers back in the 1940s faced. They knew it should and would work, it was just a case of making it happen.The integration stage is being aided using tools unavailable to Wilkes and his peers, said Dr Andrew Herbert, overall project manager for the Edsac reconstruction.""What is working in our favour is that we use modern computing to test 1940s electronics,"" he said. ""It's giving us a real advantage that we can use to run the chassis through different conditions.""Despite the help from these tools, getting all the parts to click is tricky.""We are finding all the classic integration problems,"" he said. ""Different parts of the machine are expecting things at different voltages and times.""Progress is slow but there is no doubt that the machine is now coming together.""By early spring we will able to demonstrate fetching a number out of the store, giving it to the accumulator, adding one to it and then sending it back,"" said Dr Herbert.That might sound trivial but it is the basis of all machine-based computation. Getting that working will be a strong signal that the whole project is on the right track and that the machine will be recreated successfully.""We hope we will have a working machine by the summer next year,"" said Dr Herbert.

"Ransomware is the fastest growing form of computer malware, experts warn.It's a malicious virus that locks the user out of their computer and demands a fee to return their files.A report published by the Australian government claims 72% of businesses surveyed experienced ransomware incidents in 2015.The figure was just 17% in 2013 .It's also a growing threat for mobile devices as it can be hidden in an app, says Gert-Jan Schenk, vice-president at internet security company Lookout.""For the most part, we've seen ransomware delivered through drive-by downloads - it pretends to be a popular app, increasing the chances that you'll click on it,"" he explains.""To avoid these threats, users should be very careful about what apps they install, and where they come from - read the reviews on Google Play, and avoid side-loading from untrusted sources.""Like most computer viruses, ransomware often arrives in the form of a phishing email, or spam, or a fake software update - and the recipient clicks a link or opens an attachment.The virus then sets to work encrypting the user's files.Once the computer is effectively locked down, it demands a fee - often in bitcoins because it is less easy to trace - for the return of the files.The fee is generally one or two bitcoins - the equivalent of about $500 (£330).It is less common now, but in the earlier days of the malware - about five years ago - the ransom note could take the form of a law enforcement notice.The user was directed to a web page that appeared to be from, for example, the FBI, falsely claiming illegal images of children had been been found on the machine and a fine was payable.There is generally a time limit to comply, after which the ransom increases.Sometimes it is just a threat, but mostly the virus really does encrypt files.The only way to retrieve your files without paying the ransom is to go to a backed-up version.Neil Douglas, from Edinburgh-based IT company Network Roi, has just helped a small business client whose server was hit by ransomware.""We had to recover everything from back-up. We'd had a back-up two minutes before the infection, so the timing couldn't have been any better - but it did result in quite a bit of downtime,"" he says.""You could risk paying them - but it's a bit like paying a blackmailer. We would only recommend it as a last resort.""You don't know whether they'll come back for more, you don't know that they'll clear the infection.""Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward says paying also leaves you vulnerable to further cybercrime.""As soon as you pay up, you get on a suckers' list and you'll probably get contacted again,"" he says.""It's low-hanging fruit for the criminals.""While all the expert advice is, of course, not to pay, plenty of people do - even those you would least expect to.Tewksbury Police, in the US, admitted they had paid up when their main server had been attacked and locked down at the end of last year.""Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,"" Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the town's local paper.""We did everything we possibly could.""It was an eye-opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything.""Paying the bitcoin ransom was the last resort.""Ransomware is lucrative for criminals because so many victims pay rather than face the shame of false accusations - or like the police department, they just desperately need their files.""Some companies have set up bitcoin accounts in case it happens to them,"" says Prof Woodward.""I would recommend that nobody ever pays up.""The only way to deal with it is to be sure you have a virus checker and back up.""""It tends to be organised crime,"" says Prof Woodward.""They do make millions out of it. It's opportunistic... they just try it on everybody. You keep third parties out of it - the bank isn't involved.""Recent research by Palo Alto Networks and industry partners suggested one family of ransomware known as Crypto Wall had generated about $325m (£215m) for the gang behind it.""In the volume cybercrime space, ransomware is one of the most prolific problems we face,"" Greg Day, chief security officer for Europe at Palo Alto Networks, told the BBC last month.""Credit card theft is getting to the point where the value of each card is very low. As a result, ransomware has stepped into that gap and gives a higher value for each victim."""
technology	Notorious GandCrab hacker group 'returns from retirement’		"An infamous hacker group that was thought to have disbanded appears to be behind a wave of new attacks being carried out across the world.Researchers at cyber-security company Secureworks say they reached their conclusion after analysing a new strain of computer virus.They claim the culprits are the GandCrab crew.The gang is thought to be Russian and previously sold customised ransomware to other criminals.Their code had scrambled data on victims' computers and demanded blackmail payments to decrypt it. It is estimated to have affected more than 1.5 million machines, with hospitals among those affected.In May, the group had surprised many in the security industry when it announced it was ""retiring"" after earning more than $2bn (£1.6bn) from the trade.Someone claiming to be part of the group claimed it had ""cashed out"" its earnings and quit the business.It had been active since about January 2018.But Secureworks has linked the group to a new strain of ransomware called REvil or Sondinokibi.The malware has caused major disruption to hundreds of dental practices in the US as well as 22 Texas municipalities.Researchers say not only is the code similar to that of the earlier attacks but that it contains similar mistakes.Don Smith, director of Secureworks Counter Threat Unit, said his team had the group ""bang to rights"".""We weren't surprised the group resurfaced,"" he added.""GandCrab offered a good return for criminal actors. It's unlikely an existing and proficient group would just walk away from that.""It's possible that they wanted to reduce the overall attention that was focused on the GandCrab 'brand' and have relaunched with a new product."""
technology	Computer paints 'new Rembrandt' after old works analysis	Algorithm artist	"A team of technologists working with Microsoft and others have produced a 3D-printed painting in the style of Dutch master Rembrandt.The portrait was created after existing works by the artist were analysed by a computer.A new work was then designed to look as much like a Rembrandt as possible - while remaining an original portrait.It was then 3D-printed to give it the same texture as an oil painting.""We really wanted to understand what makes a face look like a Rembrandt,"" Emmanuel Flores, director of technology for the project, told the BBC.After they had been digitally tagged by humans, data on Rembrandt's paintings was gathered by computers which discovered patterns in how the Dutch master would, for example, characteristically shape a subject's eyes in his portraits.Then, machine-learning algorithms were developed which could output a new portrait mirroring Rembrandt's style.To limit the many possible results to a specific type of individual, the computer was asked to produce a portrait of a Caucasian male between the ages of 30 and 40, with facial hair, wearing black clothes with a white collar and a hat, facing to the right.""We found that with certain variations in the algorithm, for example, the hair might be distributed in different ways,"" explained Mr Flores.But humans didn't decide the final look and feel of the final portrait - they simply chose algorithms based on their efficiency and let the computer come up with the finished result.Finally, a 3D texture for the painting was applied based on the height and depth of paint applied to Rembrandt's works.As this was 3D-printed, artists's brushstrokes themselves could be mimicked in the final product.""Our goal was to make a machine that works like Rembrandt,"" said Mr Flores. ""We will understand better what makes a masterpiece a masterpiece.""However, he added, ""I don't think we can substitute Rembrandt - Rembrandt is unique.""The two-year project, entitled ""The Next Rembrandt"", was a collaboration between Microsoft, financial firm ING, Delft University of Technology and two Dutch art museums - Mauritshuis and Rembrandthuis.A public exhibition of the portrait is planned and details of the display will be released at a later date."
technology	Could blacklisting China's AI champions backfire?	Chinese chipsAI chip designersNational security	"Just over two years ago, China announced an audacious plan to overtake the US and lead the ""world in AI [artificial intelligence] technology and applications by 2030"".It is already widely regarded to have overtaken the EU in many aspects.But now its plans may be knocked off course by the US restricting certain Chinese companies from buying technologies developed or manufactured in the States.Washington's justification is that the organisations involved have made products used to commit human rights abuses against China's Muslim ethnic minorities.But it is notable that those on its blacklist include many of China's official ""national AI champions"", among them:Like the telecoms firm Huawei before them, they now face major disruption as a consequence of the Trump administration's intervention.That is, in part, because they are reliant on US-based know-how.SenseTime, for example, formed an alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) last year to jointly fund research projects. And Yitu recently worked with researchers at the University of California San Diego to develop algorithms to diagnose illnesses in children.The move also threatens to jeopardise the companies' ability to attract foreign investment. The Bloomberg news agency has already suggested that a planned $1bn flotation by Megvii could be derailed as a consequence.But perhaps most crucially, the blacklisting threatens to cut off the supply of computer chips and other components that Hikvision requires to build its surveillance cameras, and the others need to train their algorithms.The US is the undisputed leader in semiconductors.Whether its CPUs (central processing unit) and GPUs (graphics processing units) from tech giants including Intel and Nvdia, or chips that specialise in AI-related tasks from lesser-known firms such as Ambarella and ON Semiconductor - American firms provide the tech that underpins the Chinese tech firms' progress.This dependence has not gone unnoticed.At present only 16% of the semiconductors used within China are made in the country, and only half of those by local companies - according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But the study notes that Beijing aims to boost that figure to 40% by the end of next year, and raise it to 70% by 2025.""For decades, building indigenous Chinese chips has been an aspiration of the government,"" Matt Sheehan, author of The Transpacific Experiment - a book about China and the US's tech ties - told the BBC.""Moves like the entity lists have turned that aspiration into an imperative for the government, but also potentially a matter of life or death for private Chinese companies.""That doesn't mean they'll succeed at it any time soon. This is one of the most complex engineering tasks out there, one that often requires decades of accumulated in-house knowledge and experience.""But it does seem that China's own AI chip start-ups will not be short of cash or new orders any time soon.""Number of firms (June 2019)Over recent weeks, first Huawei and then Alibaba have unveiled computer server chips specially designed to carry out machine learning tasks at high speed.Xiaomi has also said it is working on a similar product.Meanwhile, smaller start-ups have secured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds for other types of AI processors, such as chips for self-driving cars or processors for ""intelligent robots"".American firms are not standing still, but one Washington-based think tank warns the US should not consider its lead to be unassailable.""US firms are also developing specialised AI chips,"" the Center for Data Innovation said in a report.""Nonetheless, China's development of well-funded AI chip start-ups and advancements in chip design indicate it may be able to close at least some of the gap.""It added that the EU was a ""laggard"" in this field by comparison.All this matters because AI-driven technologies have the potential to make companies more productive, citizens better-educated and healthier - and also armies better equipped to wage wars.""China's success in commercial AI and semiconductor markets has direct relevance to China's geopolitical power,"" noted Gregory Allen for the Center for a New American Security.""It reduces the ability of the United States government to put diplomatic and economic pressure on China and... it increases the technological capabilities available to China's military and intelligence community.""Regarding the latter, essentially all major technology firms in China co-operate extensively with China's military and state security services and are legally required to do so.""Putting the brakes on China's AI champions may serve the US's own national security and foreign policy interest in the short term.But ultimately, it could spur on the Chinese Communist Party's determination to make its tech industry less dependent on foreign partners, with all the financial and geopolitical consequences that entails."
technology	Early Apple computer fails to sell	Supercomputer power	"An Apple 1 motherboard, a 79-year-old TV and the only surviving processor of the last supercomputer designed by Seymour Cray have been auctioned at a vintage tech sale in New York.However, neither the Apple 1 nor the rare antique television were sold.Apple 1 computers are usually valuable collectables. Made in 1976, there are now only about 50 left in the world.At a similar sale last year, one fetched $365,000 (£237,000). And in 2013, another attracted a $905,000 bid.The Apple 1 at Monday's vintage tech sale had a starting price of $300,000.The Cray-4 processor sold for $37,500.The 1936 Baird television set may not work - but auctioneer Bonhams had forecast that it could fetch between $20,000 (£13,000) and $30,000.Seymour Cray is widely considered to have designed the world's first commercial supercomputers.He was working on the Cray-4 model when his company went bankrupt in 1995, and the following year he died in a traffic accident.The processor, with serial number 001, was listed with an expected price tag of $50,000 - $80,000.Other lots included an early German Enigma machine, handwritten paperwork by Albert Einstein and a 19th Century telegraph sending and receiving set used by spies during the US Civil War.CCS analyst and mobile phone collector Ben Wood said: ""During a period of birth, amazing things happen. These devices become almost curiosities which shape an industry.""Their scarcity is always going to bring inflation in terms of the value of these devices.""You can go right back to the evolution of technology - lots of people are collecting typewriters.""Mr Wood, who has a collection of more than 1,000 mobile handsets dating back to 1982, added that collectors did still tend to prefer working models despite their comparatively limited performance.""To me personally it doesn't matter whether they still work as I am interested in physical design,"" he said.""However, for a lot of people it would matter immensely.""As devices became more similar in appearance, it was the software behind them that could become the collectable of the future, Mr Wood said.""If the physical devices all start looking the same... I have a vision that people will start keeping the software,"" he said."
technology	Mental-health information 'sold to advertisers'	'Depression test'Sensitive dataProgrammatic advertising	"Sensitive personal information about mental health is routinely being traded to advertisers around the web, a study has suggested.Privacy International (PI) investigated more than 100 mental health websites in France, Germany and the UK.It found many shared user data with third parties, including advertisers and large technology companies.The way information was being sold was ""neither transparent nor fair and often lacked a clear legal basis"", it said.Nearly all the websites investigated had large number of cookies - computer files that download on to a user's device to enable tracking - three-quarters of which were there for marketing or advertising purposes, according to PI.On average, each mental-health web pages contained:Many of the web pages contained cookies that enable targeted advertising from Google, Facebook and Amazon.And many used Hotjar, a company that provides software that allows everything users type or click on to be logged and played back.""It is exceedingly difficult for people to seek mental-health information and for example take a 'depression test' without countless third parties watching,"" said Frederike Kaltheuner, PI's director of corporate exploitation.""We visit these sites and reveal so much about ourselves and that should not be used by companies we have never heard of to track you around the internet and use the data in an opaque advertising eco-system.""The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) raised the level of consent required before websites can download cookies on to a user's device.Its ePrivacy Directive requires users are given clear and comprehensive information about what data is being used and how.And in the case of particularly sensitive data, such as health information, this consent must be explicit.But the PI investigation found many cookies were installed on people's devices before any consent had been given.Some websites had no consent form, while those that did ask for consent did so in a very generic way, the report said.""Most people don't have the time to navigate complicated consent boxes which nudge them towards consent,"" said Ms Kaltheuner.""These sites should not have any more cookies than are strictly needed.""Users should be able to say that they do not want to be tracked by Google, Facebook and data brokers.""PI also analysed nine websites that offered visitors quizzes about their mental health.Three of these had cookies that enabled tracking for programmatic advertising, where hundreds of companies bid in real-time for advertising space, it said.This was problematic because sensitive information could be broadcast to all of those bidding, PI said.Programmatic advertising is currently being investigated by the UK's information commissioner.PI also found Doctissimo.fr sent test answers, together with a unique identifier such as an IP address, to a third party - Player.qualifo.com, which had provided the test form."
technology	Twitter account deletions on 'pause' after outcry		"Twitter has said it will ""pause"" plans to disable inactive accounts following user backlash, a day after announcing plans for a huge cull of such accounts.The social network said it now would not remove accounts until it had a process for ""memorialising"" dead users on the network.It admitted not having a policy in place was a ""miss on our part”.The firm said it was taking action on inactive accounts due to regulatory concerns.It said once it had a full process in place, account deactivations would occur in the EU first. This was in order, Twitter said, to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).""We apologise for the confusion and will keep you all posted,"" the company said in a series of tweets posted on Wednesday.On Monday Twitter had begun contacting users who hadn't logged in in the past six months, warning them that they would have their accounts deleted unless they signed in and agreed to the firm's latest privacy policy.After reporting from the BBC and others, the company admitted it had not considered the issue of the potential upset that would be caused by the removal of accounts belonging to users who had died.Writing on TechCrunch, Drew Olanoff, a communications officer at investment firm Scaleworks, said his ""heart sank"" when he learned of Twitter's plans, as he often checked in on his father's account, several years after his death.""It’s my way, odd or not, of remembering him. Keeping his spirit alive. His tweets are timestamped moments that he shared with the world,"" Mr Olanoff wrote. ""And Twitter is sweeping them up like crumpled-up paper and junk in a dustbin.”Other networks, such as Facebook, offer a process called ""memorialisation"", whereby verified family members or other loved ones can request a deceased user's account is kept on the network, but frozen in time. Interactions with the account are limited in order to help prevent trolling and other abuse.Twitter said it would create such a tool.It added: ""Beyond complying with GDPR, we may broaden the enforcement of our inactivity policy in the future to comply with other regulations around the world and to ensure the integrity of the service.""We will communicate with all of you if we do.""_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Want to run faster? Improve your algorithm	'Our sixth vital sign''Asymmetries and quirks'	"Runner Guillaume Adam wants to go faster, further and for longer.Like many modern runners, the former French national team member uses technology as a key element in helping him hit a new personal best.Gadgets are as essential a part of a runner's kit as the shoes on their feet. Few head out these days without a step counter, GPS watch, smartphone or smartwatch.The wearables keep an eye on the distance covered, pace, heart rate and cadence - helping to ensure they get as much out of the session as possible.""I'm a scientist as well as a runner so when I want data I want to get reliable data,"" said Mr Adam.Unfortunately, he said, many wearables do not gather data accurately.One study by consumer group Which? suggested many fitness trackers underestimated the distance runners cover - with the least accurate adding unnecessary miles to a long run.""You can get data with a GPS watch but you do not know how the algorithm is made or its accuracy,"" he said. ""If you want to analyse the data, it needs to be available to you.""In a bid to manage his workouts better, Mr Adam is now trialling a wearable that has emerged from medical research.Called GaitUp, the sensor has been developed by Dr Benoit Mariani, based on his work on spotting the early signs of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.These physical signs, says Dr Mariani, make themselves felt in very subtle ways long before standard tests can catch them.""If you have a muscle weakness or neurological disorder it will be reflected in your gait first,"" he said.""Those signs have been under the radar because there's been no easy tool to measure them.""Changes in the way people walk can be as revealing as those seen in other recognised markers of bodily health - heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration rate and oxygen saturation.""Gait is our sixth vital sign,"" he said.The sensor developed by Dr Mariani's engineering team does more than just measure steps. It can capture rear and forefoot strike angles, as well as the amount of time each foot is in contact with the ground.""We're interested in the quality of the gait,"" he said.He is not the only one. Researchers are keen to get better data about the way elite athletes run, says sports scientist Dr Yannis Pitsiladis from the University of Brighton.He is part of the long-term Sub2Hrs research project that aims to develop the training methods, techniques and technology that will help a runner set a recognised world record for running the marathon in under two hours.On 12 October this year, Kenyan running great Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier but the help he got, from a phalanx of pace-setters and an electric vehicle, meant it was not recognised as a world record.""To break the sub-two hour barrier, you need to get everything right,"" Dr Pitsiladis told the BBC.""You need to identify the right athlete, right weather conditions, right track and also you need bio-energetics,"" he said.Making sure the minimal amount of energy is expended at each step of the marathon will be key, he said.""The more economical you are, the more you can maintain that pace until the end of the race.""Anything you do to make you more economical, whether it is the shoe, or the data, or the terrain you are running on being 1% or 2% or 3% better will have a huge impact on your performance,"" he said.It took an improvement of less than 0.5% for Kipchoge to shift his fastest marathon time below the two-hour mark. Improving by 1% or more would mean smashing the barrier.""With these kinds of athletes, I would argue that we have not got the best out of them yet,"" said Dr Pitsiladis. ""There's not a lot of science in their training and a lot of these athletes train themselves.""There was ample room for improvement, such as refining their stride pattern or pacing, he said. Sensors are now so small that they can be worn during a race without becoming a burden.Until now, most analysis of pace and performance has happened on a treadmill or after an event but this does not really capture what an athlete undergoes while racing, said Dr Pitsiladis.For instance, treadmills can exaggerate the way a foot rolls during each step and give a false sense of how a runner moves.After-the-event analysis of the way a runner moves during a race or training run is useful, he said, but it would be better to do it as they are running and adjust as they go.Mr Adam used GaitUp to prepare for the New York City marathon and it helped him become the fastest French finisher in that race, hitting a time of 2h 26m.Running coach Sam Murphy questioned whether the information provided by sensors such as GaitUp was too comprehensive.""What are you actually going to do about the information that tells you your left foot externally rotates more than your right?"" she asked. ""Or that your take-off angle is too flat?""Many elite athletes such as Haile Gebrselassie and Paula Radcliffe had ""asymmetries"" and ""quirks"", she said, suggesting the body can work around the disadvantages physiology or upbringing may have imposed on them.Also, she added, given that runners typically take about 10,000 strides per hour, altering each foot strike to make it perfect could be difficult.But she conceded that having ""greater awareness"" of how people run and what they do when they run was undoubtedly useful.Steady improvement was all about acting on feedback, said Ms Murphy.""Sometimes getting that data or feedback internally may be more impactful than from an external source such as these devices,"" she said. ""We aren't machines, we're way, way smarter than that."""
technology	Election debate: Conservatives criticised for renaming Twitter profile 'factcheckUK'		"Social networking site Twitter has said the Conservative Party misled the public when it rebranded one of its Twitter accounts.The @CCHQPress account - the Tory press office - was renamed ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate involving Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.After the debate, the account reverted to its original branding.Twitter said it would take ""decisive corrective action"" if a similar stunt was attempted again.But the firm does not appear to have taken any action over this particular incident.""Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,"" a spokesperson said.""We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action.""The Tories were earlier criticised by genuine fact-checking agency Full Fact, which said in a statement: ""It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate.""Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as FullFact, FactCheck or FactCheckNI.""Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defended the rebranding.He told BBC Newsnight: ""The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained CCHQPress, so it's clear the nature of the site.""Mr Cleverly added the decision to rebrand the account would have been made by the party's digital team, which he said operated within his remit.He said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with the party ""calling out when the Labour Party put what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain"".Reacting to the decision, the Labour Party tweeted: ""The Conservatives' laughable attempt to dupe those watching the #ITVDebate by renaming their twitter account shows you can't trust a word they say.""The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, said the ploy was ""straight out of Donald Trump or Putin's playbook"", adding the Tories were ""deliberately misleading the public"".Twitter is a minority interest. Journalists are over-represented on this platform compared to other social media, creating a profound danger that they misinterpret what happens on Twitter as representative of the wider world.Nevertheless, an important threshold has now been repeatedly breached by Britain's party of government, and Twitter is the site where it happened.It is perhaps arguable that, like the doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer a fortnight ago, the re-branding of CCHQ as a fact-checking service falls into the broad category known as satire.But that is a stretch. The effect will have been to dupe many unknowing members of the public, who genuinely thought it was a fact-checking service when it gave opinions on Jeremy Corbyn.This is not to patronise voters, who are wise; rather, it is to recognise that in a world of information overload, what cuts through are stunts.Which is why, ironically, in CCHQ this morning there will be younger staff who chalk this up as a victory.Journalists thus face a dilemma: call out disinformation, and you play to the worst of social media, distracting from questions of policy; but ignore it, and the truth recedes ever further from view.Twitter has policies regarding deceptive behaviour on the platform. The company said it can remove an account’s “verified” status if the account owner is said to be “intentionally misleading people on Twitter by changing one's display name or bio”.Other users on the platform subsequently changed their display names to mock the move. Among them, writer Charlie Brooker, who tweeted: “We have always been at war with Eastasia”, a reference to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four.This latest controversial move on social media comes less than a month after the Conservative Party was criticised for posting a ""doctored"" video involving Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, in which the shadow Brexit secretary was made to look as if he met a question, posed by ITV's Piers Morgan, with silence.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the video, since taken down, was meant to be ""light-hearted"". The party later posted an extended version of the interview.Full Fact, which is a charity supported by donations from the likes of Google, described the incident as ""irresponsible""."
technology	Online election ads - who is targeting whom?	Who is advertising?What are the adverts saying?How are the adverts targeted?Does this targeting work?	"Last weekend, BBC News economics editor Faisal Islam and I launched a project to try to get beneath the digital skin of this election.We each tweeted a video asking anyone who saw a political advert in their Facebook feed to send it to us, along with the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" information that pops up when you click on a menu.We were not sure anyone would respond - but quickly the emails began to flood in.So far, we have received more than 600 messages with screenshots of election adverts and the information about how they have been targeted.Here's what we have learned so far.Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all got off the mark quickly, with our respondents sending us a variety of ads.And as the week went on, ads from the Brexit Party and the SNP started coming in.But what was striking was the number of non-party organisations getting involved.The most notable example was the Fair Tax Campaign, whose ad attacking Labour's tax plans was sent in by three people.It appeared without the ""Paid for by"" information Facebook requires - and when we contacted the social media giant, the advert was taken down.A few days later, it was back with the message: ""Paid for by Alexander Karcejwski Crowley,"" confirmation a former aide to Boris Johnson who left Downing Street in late September was behind the campaign.Other organisations posting ads included Parent's Choice, a campaign attacking Labour's education plans, funded by former Conservative minister Richard Tracey.Ads were also run by Best for Brexit and Best for Britain - two campaigns on opposite sides of the Brexit debate.And on Sunday, we got our first email with an ad from the Hope Not Hate campaign - not endorsing any party but attacking Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Tory leader Boris Johnson.The Conservatives started with very targeted adverts aimed at key marginal constituencies, including Bridgend, with the message only a few thousand votes were needed ""to get Brexit done"".But later they broadened out with an attack on Jeremy Corbyn. Within hours of former Labour minister Ian Austin's call for voters to abandon the party, the Labour leader was featured in an ad.Labour's ads have focused on the NHS and the claim Mr Johnson poses a threat to it. One message featured a Guardian article about suggestions the UK could pay more for drugs following any trade deal with US President Donald Trump.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have been hammering away with a message they will stop Brexit and ""the two old parties have failed Britain"".While some of the early Tory ads were closely geographically targeted, later on they all seemed broad-brush.The ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" message often read: ""Conservatives want to reach people like their customers,"" over 18 and in England.But in a couple of cases, the target was more specific - males aged 23 to 30, people aged 55 or over, or women with degrees aged 30 to 50.Labour's approach to targeting is more opaque.Many of its ads told readers Facebook had ""matched your information with information on"" a list Labour wanted to reach, derived from a ""hashed list"" uploaded by Experian Marketing Services.Experian told us it used publicly available data from sources such as the electoral roll - matched with Facebook users, but then anonymised - ""to target relevant communications to particular sections of the population"". This does not include credit scores, it added.Facebook, meanwhile, said it ""does not learn any new identifying information about a person when a business uploads a list"".The Liberal Democrats are somewhat more obvious in their targeting.Their ad about the ""old parties"" is often aimed at people aged 18 to 35. And their media habits often seem to be a focus - one advert targeted at Michael Gove's Surrey Heath constituency was trying to reach ""people who Facebook thinks are interested in The Guardian and Mock the Week"".The Brexit Party has tended to target people in specific locations, from Frome in Somerset to Skipton in Yorkshire.But one ""Why am I seeing this?"" message gives useful insights into the workings of Facebook's ""lookalike audience"" feature, used by many of the parties.""The Brexit Party identified a group of existing customers that it wanted to use to find similar customers,"" the message said.""Facebook used this group of existing customers to find potential customers for the advertiser.""Much has been made of the way Facebook allows political campaigns to micro-target their ads, crafting hundreds of different messages suited to the personalities of each individual.So far, however, our project seems to suggest this whole idea may have been oversold.We have seen no evidence voters are seeing lots of different messages, indeed the same adverts keep cropping up all over the country.And we are hearing plenty of scepticism about targeting, with respondents convinced the parties are missing the mark both geographically and when it comes to their political preferences.""They got my age right is all you can say,"" wrote one person about a Conservative ad aimed at anyone over 18.""I live in Wales and never voted Tory and never will.""Someone in the Chorley constituency of the new speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle wondered why the Labour Party was targeting him with an ad when it would not need to contest that seat.Plenty of people reported ads that made incorrect assumptions about their location - suggesting Facebook can often be a blunt instrument.Most bizarrely, one ad urging a vote for the Conservatives in the Wirral West constituency to ""get Brexit done"" was received in Clitheroe - and actually appeared to have been targeted at the Lancashire town.""Nowhere near. We're about 89 miles roughly north of the Wirral peninsula,"" wrote the Clitheroe-based recipient, helpfully attaching a Google Maps screenshot.And a few people were angered by the fact they had been tracked at all.""None of my profile information is supposed to be shared beyond me or my friends but my information seems to have been uploaded and shared with five different marketing companies,"" wrote one person who sent us three ads.""I tightened up my ad settings a few days ago and I've had no political ads since.""About half a million pounds has been spent on Facebook ads in the first week of the campaign and all the signs are we could see record spending by polling day.""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted - the trouble is I don't know which half,"" an American retailing tycoon is supposed to have said more than 100 years ago. Some things don't change.Across the political spectrum, the parties' digital experts will be trying in the coming weeks to work out how to cut down on waste when it comes to their Facebook campaigns.Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social-media platform, send a screenshot of it and the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk."
technology	Child abuse images hidden in crypto-currency blockchain	How did this happen?Zero toleranceEasily accessible'Not yet mature'	"Images of child sexual abuse have been found embedded in the system powering a high-profile crypto-currency.Somebody added the illegal images to the core ledger of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) by using a payment processor.This ledger, known as the blockchain, is a running record of crypto-currency transactions, shared among users of the platform.Experts have warned that abuse of blockchain tech is a growing problem.The blockchain is central to the way many crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin work and in theory stops people making fake transactions or manipulating their account balance.One key feature of the blockchain is that information added to it cannot be changed without significant effort.In January, the amount of data that could be added to the BSV blockchain was increased significantly.Before that, people could generally add only short chunks of text or web links to the blockchain.But now it is possible to add full images in an encoded format.Payment system Money Button said its service had been used to post the illegal images on the BSV blockchain in early February.UK laws state that the simple possession of indecent photographs of children is an offence and any distribution of such material can warrant a longer prison sentence.Jimmy Nguyen, founder of crypto-cash company nChain, which oversees the BSV currency, said it had ""zero tolerance"" for illegal use of the system.""The Bitcoin SV blockchain is not a place for criminal activity - and if you use it for illegal purposes, you will leave a digitally signed evidence trail that cannot be erased,"" he told BBC News.""We stand ready to work with global law enforcement authorities to stamp out this and any other illegal misuse of Bitcoin.""Ryan Charles, founder of Money Button, said: ""Since most businesses increased the size of allowed data recently, making it possible to post large files, criminals are trying to push the limits.""The abuse images embedded in the BSV blockchain were spotted when they appeared on Bitcoinfiles.org.The website lets people browse a rolling list of messages and other content added to the blockchain.The appearance of the images prompted police to investigate. Bitcoinfiles.org has since closed the blockchain browsing service.In addition, Money Button has banned the user that uploaded the material.It has also put in place filtering systems to spot when anyone tries to upload similar content. Money Button is part-funded by nChain.""Criminals should understand that everything on the blockchain is signed, time-stamped, and linked to everything else,"" said Mr Charles.""We have all the information we need to track down criminals and prosecute them.""Information about the person who uploaded the images has been passed to the authorities.Eric Erstu, who runs the Cryptograffiti website that lets people read messages embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, said: ""There is nothing that could have prevented this from happening in other blockchains.""It takes special care to seek and find illegal content from any block chain, as it is not a trivial process,"" he told BBC News.""As for law enforcement, they would have to do the good old detective work in hope of tracking down the person who uploaded the illegal content on the block chain.""Since everything you do on the blockchain is immutable, tracking down criminals is not too difficult.""Blockchain researcher Roman Matzutt, from the University of Aachen, in Germany, who has studied the problem of people uploading illegal content to the blockchain, warned it had become a ""pressing issue"".He said there was ""ongoing research"" to find ways to remove such content from blockchains but these were ""not yet mature"".And there was a ""lack of sufficient sustainable solutions apart from making content insertion into public blockchains hard""."
technology	Could Blockchain solve Irish border issue?		"At last, a technology solution to the Irish border problem post-Brexit.No, it's not barcodes, augmented reality glasses or solar-powered drones, but that favourite of every consultant and futurist worth their salt, the blockchain.And this time it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer who's apparently decided that if a distributed database can solve everything from global warming to age verification, then delivering frictionless trade should be a piece of cake.""There is technology becoming available,"" said Philip Hammond when asked about solutions to the border problem at the Conservative Party conference.""I don't claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious technology is blockchain.""Now, Mr Hammond shouldn't be embarrassed about his lack of expertise - I've spoken to countless blockchain entrepreneurs and consultants who have failed to give convincing explanations of what the technology does and why it is going to prove so revolutionary.But just how he thinks a decentralised and immutable database will smooth the path of goods across the border is unclear. After all, the only large-scale deployment of blockchain to date has been in providing the infrastructure for Bitcoin, where, in the words of the economist Nouriel Roubini, it has processed transactions like a ""slow energy-inefficient dinosaur"".I called the Treasury to try to understand why blockchain might be the answer. All I got on the record was this: ""We are actively considering technologies that could help facilitate trade over the Northern Ireland - Ireland land border, in order to streamline any requirements that may emerge for traders after the UK leaves the EU. These technological solutions will support our commitment to no physical infrastructure at the land border.""The impression I came away with was that blockchain was just one of a number of technologies they've been looking at but they have no idea yet when or whether it might provide a practical solution.But one can sympathise with civil servants doubtless under siege from London's teeming army of blockchain hucksters. In recent weeks I've been contacted by excitable PR people telling me how, with the help of their clients, government departments from HM Revenue and Customs to Land Registry are embracing blockchain in a big way.Once I have got in touch with those departments, I've been met with weary sighs and suggestions that Whitehall's enthusiasm for blockchain has been somewhat exaggerated.The irony is that many of the most enthusiastic blockchain evangelists are libertarians who believe it will eventually bring about the demise first of central banks then of government itself.But for now it is the new, new thing, bigger than the internet - so don't be surprised if more politicians climb on the blockchain bandwagon."
technology	'Child porn links could make Bitcoin blockchain illegal'		"Researchers in Germany have found hundreds of links to child sexual abuse imagery on Bitcoin's blockchain.This could make using the blockchain, a digital ledger of crypto-currency transactions, illegal.The study, from RWTH Aachen University, also said other files on the blockchain may violate copyright and privacy laws.Researchers said they had found eight files with sexual content. And three of these contained content ""objectionable for almost all jurisdictions"".Two of these between them listed more than 200 links to child sexual abuse imagery, the study said.And if records of the files were stored on users' computers, they may be in violation of the law.Garrick Hileman, a crypto-currency expert at Cambridge University, said the issue of illegal content had been ""discussed and known about for awhile.""Pruning, or altering parts of the blockchain ledger, would allow users to rid their local copies of illegal content, he said, but was likely to be too technical for most Bitcoin users.""There are big barriers anytime you need to make modifications,"" Mr Hileman said.But he added that although maintaining a complete record of the blockchain was more secure than an altered copy, ""many would argue that it's not that important""."
technology	IBM pitches blockchain for cannabis sale	Seed to sale	"Blockchain technology could provide a secure way to track the legal sale of cannabis in Canada, IBM has said.The British Columbia government has begun a public consultation on the legalisation of marijuana, which could take effect in July.Blockchain is a secure method of recording data using a digital ledger system distributed among hundreds of computers.The technology underlies crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.IBM said: ""Blockchain is an ideal mechanism in which BC can transparently capture the history of cannabis through the entire supply chain, ultimately ensuring consumer safety while exerting regulatory control - from seed to sale.""Blockchain is a highly effective trust mechanism which uses a cryptographically-secure shared ledger to irrefutably track complex transactions amongst many known parties.""The distributed nature of a blockchain database means it is harder for hackers to attack it and the data is kept secure and private because the cryptographic key that secures it cannot be converted back.Technology company Everledger is already using the technology to verify the history of diamond transactions."
technology	Mystery of the disappearing 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova		"If ever an industry needed a PR makeover, it's the world of cryptocurrencies.It seems every week brings evidence of scams and fraud, from the hacking of exchanges to Initial Coin Offerings where the founder disappears with the money. Just on Monday, America's Securities and Exchange Commission charged the founder of an online adult entertainment marketplace with running a fraudulent ICO (Initial Coin Offering).But that case involved tens of thousands of dollars - a mere bagatelle compared to the monster cryptocurrency scam whose story is being told in an enthralling BBC podcast.In The Missing Cryptoqueen, Jamie Bartlett investigates the woman behind OneCoin, a scheme which managed to persuade investors around the world to part with as much as £4bn ($4.9bn)They had bought into the compelling vision of a new kind of money sold by Dr Ruja Ignatova, in a series of events in countries around the world. You can catch a flavour of the mixture of hoopla, hucksterism and blockchain balderdash in a video of her appearance at London's Wembley Arena in 2016.Dr Ignatova - or Dr Ruja to her fans - walks on to ""This Girl is on Fire"", tells an excited crowd that OneCoin is on course to overtake Bitcoin, and derides ""all those Mickey Mouse coins that have copied our concept.""Plenty of people were convinced, including one of the stars of the podcast, Jen McAdam from Glasgow. She invested €10,000 herself in the Bulgaria-based scheme and persuaded family members to put in €250,000 - that's about £220,000 at current exchange rates.But in 2017, Dr Ruja Ignatova disappeared - and she hasn't been seen since.The investigation by the team behind the podcast has uncovered just how successful OneCoin had been in spreading its message around the world. Internal documents reveal that people in 175 countries invested, with much of the money coming in a six-month period in 2016 when Dr Ruja was on a global tour - including that Wembley appearance.In the UK, £26m was invested in that period, and the podcast team reckons that the total coming from British investors may have been as high as £96m.But the documents show that €427m came from China in 2016, with people in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany also keen investors. Even in poorer countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Uganda, people parted with substantial sums.Earlier this year in the United States, Dr Ignatova was charged in absentia with money laundering, with the Department of Justice calling OneCoin an old-fashioned pyramid scheme.And indeed this and other crypto-scandals seem disturbingly familiar to anyone who has been in financial journalism for a while - the same old tricks delivered with a hi-tech veneer.Back in 2016, Bitcoin was still a revolutionary disrupter of the tired old financial system, blockchain was going to be more important than the internet and something called an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was going to show Wall Street that an Initial Public Offering was so ""last century"".Now, after the wild gyrations in the value of cryptocurrencies and the realisation that just about every ICO fails to deliver on its overblown promises - even if it's not an outright scam - you might think that ""crypto"" is the last word anyone would want to attach to a new project.That came to mind this week when I attended a briefing about Facebook's plan to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra. The briefing was with the Libra Association, the collective of 28 partners including Visa, PayPal, Uber and Spotify, who are joining with Facebook to launch the currency.The plan has already run into a lot of opposition from regulators and I put it to the Association's Chief Operating Officer Bertrand Perez that much of this was due to that C word. Surely such a powerful coalition could have invented a new payments system - a more ambitious version of Kenya's Mpesa perhaps - that was neither a crypto-currency nor dependent on a blockchain?No, he insisted, blockchain was the cornerstone of the Libra project, immune to fraud, fast and efficient: ""This technology is the future for sending and receiving money.""Funnily enough, that was similar to Dr Ruja Ignatova's message to the Wembley faithful in 2016 - OneCoin was going to be ""borderless, safe and easy to use.""Now of course Libra is a very different kettle of fish, backed by many very respectable institutions which have pledged that it will not launch until regulators are happy. But convincing governments that this cryptocurrency will not be a safe haven for money launderers, or pose a threat to economic stability, is going to be an uphill struggle.Back to OneCoin - the company behind it rejects allegations that it is a scam, and states that ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency"".It says the podcast ""will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased"".The company also claims that the allegations made about it around the world are being challenged, stating: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established"".You can listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen on BBC Sounds."
technology	Tech Tent: How cats and Russia are using the blockchain	Blockchain for the masses?Voting via blockchain?Taiwan's tech reboot	"What do virtual cats and a Russian voting system have in common? They both depend on the blockchain, and on Tech Tent this week we discover why this technology is becoming hugely fashionable as the value of crypto-currencies which depend on it soar. Plus we hear from Taiwan, a high tech nation that is still struggling to create a start-up culture.'CryptoKitties on the Ethereum blockchain'When I read out the above headline at a BBC editorial meeting, suggesting this was an important story, people looked at me as though I had lost my mind. But a new online craze where you buy virtual kittens with the crypto-currency Ethereum is a serious matter.CryptoKitties is based on Ethereum, the crypto-currency second only to Bitcoin in popularity, and uses the Ethereum blockchain, a networked database which records transactions on multiple computers.But such has been the excitement about these fantasy felines that Ethereum - and the blockchain which underpins it - have seized up at times during the week.Elsa Wilk, head of marketing for Axiom Zen, which is behind CryptoKitties, tells Tech Tent that it has succeeded beyond the company's wildest expectations.One cat - the ""Genesis Kitty"" - went for an extraordinary $100,000 (£74,700).But she says the project has a very important mission: ""We wanted to bring fun and games to a very serious matter, which is blockchain. It is seen as very technical, very difficult to use - we wanted to bring blockchain to the masses.""What they have also done is show up some serious problems with the technology - that it can struggle to cope with large volumes of transactions. I've been trying and failing to buy a CryptoKitty all week, stuck watching nothing happen when I try to pay, and others report similar experiences.""What you are seeing now is just growing pains,"" says Elsa Wilk. But with blockchain technology now being touted as the biggest thing since the arrival of the internet, the CryptoKitties are a warning that it may not always be fit for purpose.But wait a minute - if this technology really does guarantee trust and transparency then blockchain could be the way we stage elections, right? At least that's the theory behind a scheme in Russia which will see the technology adopted by Moscow's Active Citizen e-voting system.This is used for relatively trivial community votes on issues like the naming of a new subway station. But even here, the city's innovation adviser Andrey Belozerov tells us, there can be a lack of trust: ""In every large city there are some people who think authority is not transparent, - they say we increase votes.""He says blockchain will make voting ""absolutely transparent"" - votes will be recorded just like Bitcoin transactions on multiple computers and any attempt to tamper with the results will be visible to everyone.I was somewhat sceptical that voters would understand what made this system so trustworthy but Mr Belozerov says ""any technologist who knows blockchain understands that it is impossible to change data or delete data after it is put in"".Mind you, here's one problem. The Moscow e-voting system is going to use the Ethereum blockchain. If it gets choked up with CryptoKitties, Russian voters may find that it cannot cope with a rush to the polls.Taiwan is one the world's leading locations for hi-tech manufacturing, churning out millions of laptops and mobile phones every year.But with competition from cheaper locations mounting, the country is hoping to nurture a new breed of software start-ups. The trouble is that Taiwanese culture is not too encouraging to entrepreneurs willing to risk all to start a business that is very likely to fail.Ronald Yu, who's building a mobile app to help people find parking spaces, admits it's a challenging environment: ""My family used to say ""It's hard, you're not going to be successful"" and the government says ""Are you going to do this? I'm afraid you're not going to survive in the next 3 to 5 months.""""He says the country needs to be more positive if it is to build the next Facebook or Instagram.Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tang admits that entrepreneurs face all sorts of hurdles - regulation, a lack of venture capital, a brain drain of talent: "" I think the fourth is the general culture of being more risk-averse and not rewarding people who want to take risks enough. ""Nevertheless, there are plenty of hopeful young entrepreneurs who believe they can break through in new industries such as virtual reality. Like so many countries, Taiwan has ambitions to be the next Silicon Valley - if it can bring a bit more risk-taking into its culture, it has as good a shot as anywhere."
technology	Tech Tent: Will AI and Blockchain be game-changers?	DeepMind passes Go - without humansBlockchain and a magic money treeThe world in 2027	"Artificial intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies - three terms you need to scatter through your conversation if you want to come across as a tech guru.On Tech Tent this week we examine these trends and ask a futurologist to predict which of them will make rapid progress over the next decade.This week saw another major achievement by Google's Deep Mind, when it showed that a neural network could learn to play Go in just three days, without even looking at how humans play this complex game.AlphaGo Zero took on the previous version of the program, developed with human expertise, and beat it by 100 games to nil.The company now hopes to use this technique in other areas such as drug development.This sounds like another step on the road to more generalised artificial intelligence (AI) as opposed to systems that can only excel in one function.Reactions to this news have ranged from terror - ""another step towards the Singularity"" (the idea that artificial intelligence will overtake humans) - to cynicism, with a few suggesting that mastering a board game for a second time is hardly world changing.The man who leads the AlphaGo project, Dr David Silver, admits there is a lot of hype about AI but insists this is still an important moment: ""There's reason to be excited that these systems are genuinely able to discover knowledge for themselves.""He is cautious about the speed at which practical applications will be found but still hopeful that his team's work will have a real impact on some of the biggest problems humanity is facing.At an event in London's Docklands we found a group of fervent believers in a new investment craze. It involves businesses which create their own currencies and use them to fund projects which depend on a technology called blockchain.We made our way around the conference asking people to give us a clear explanation of blockchain and to explain why it was so exciting.Many struggled to sum it up in a sentence.""Blockchain is the possibility for any business to optimise their outs and ins, moneywise,"" said one.""It acts as a digital ledger, it stores transaction information in blocks and each block is cross referenced against the last block,"" said another.They were much more clear about its importance.""It's the future of technology,"" one man told me. ""If someone said, 'do you want to invest in the internet before the internet was created?' what would you have done?""And on that belief we found firms raising unlikely sums from initial coin offerings, or ICOs, for blockchain-powered projects. Moscow-based venture Robomed, which aims to facilitate the provision of private healthcare, planned to raise $150m (£114m) in its sale of tokens.How will they work? Well, on its website there is this explanation:""Robomed Network issues its own tokens to support smart contract between healthcare providers and patients. RBM smart medical contract elevates service value by granting its owner full accomplishment of clinical guidelines for specific case by healthcare provider.""We struggled to understand this and other ICO business plans, and over at the Financial Times we found that Izabella Kaminska shared our bemusement.She has been following this new form of finance for a while and is not convinced: ""Why would you need an ICO to raise money? If you have a good idea you should be able to raise money.""She questions what blockchain really provides apart from what she calls ""regulatory arbitrage"".She fears the main impetus for using this method of fundraising is that it does not involve all that tedious due diligence and form-filling associated with a stock market flotation.Back in 2001 a book called ""The Future of Wireless Communications"" predicted the following technology developments by 2020:Those predictions look pretty accurate and now the book's author, William Webb, a telecoms consultant, is publishing his vision of how the world will look in 10 years.His predictions include:But mostly he is very cautious about the pace of change. He does not believe we will all have smart homes - ""the benefits are not that great but the price is quite substantial"" - and he is not convinced that autonomous cars will soon be cutting congestion in cities.""It's a nice vision,"" he says. ""I think we will see a very limited autonomy. In 10 years we might well see cars on the motorways but I don't think we will see that in city centres - it's just too complicated.""And as for general artificial intelligence able to complete a variety of tasks, he thinks that is a long way off.We are told that technology is advancing at breakneck speed. But if William Webb is right it may take something of a breather over the next decade."
technology	Brittany Kaiser calls for Facebook political ad ban at Web Summit		"Former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser, recognisable to many as the unlikely star of the Netflix documentary The Great Hack, has appeared at Web Summit in Lisbon.The documentary followed the self-styled whistleblower as she testified to the UK parliament about what she knew when she worked at the firm as a business development manager.Now with a book out, she has reinvented herself as a data privacy guru aiming to educate youngsters about disinformation, and planning to put data back into the hands of users via blockchain technology.The Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2016 when it emerged that the data of up to 87 million Facebook users had been harvested via a personality quiz - and it's never been exactly clear how it was used.The consultancy aided Donald Trump's election campaign. And Ms Kaiser appeared on the firm's behalf at a Leave.EU Brexit press briefing - the two organisations say they never signed a contract to work together but Ms Kaiser has alleged that ""chargeable work was done"".In an interview with the BBC, Ms Kaiser said she wanted to see political advertising on Facebook banned.She said she feared little had changed. Hundreds of companies around the world are still crunching through personal data and throwing it back at people in the form of political ads, she said.""It is sad that we have to ban all forms of political advertising to stop people being manipulated. But it has to be done,"" she added.""Our electoral laws are not fit for purpose. Facebook functions pretty much the same and now it is not going to ban any politicians who are sending disinformation our way.""While Twitter has moved to ban political advertising, Facebook has not, and she thinks it will need government regulation to force it to.It's important, she said, because of the way data is being ""weaponised"" in political campaigning.""Data-driven campaigning gives you the edge that you need to convince swing votes one way or the other, and also to get certain people to show up to the polls,"" she said.""It can also be used to turn off your opponents and get people not to show up to the polls.""In her book Targeted, she provides new details about the methods she claims were used by Cambridge Analytica in the US presidential election, in particular how it gathered information on different personality types and sent them adverts most likely to resonate with them. The use of so-called psychographics in the Trump campaign had been denied by the firm before its collapse.""What I saw when I was at Cambridge Analytica was that individuals were deemed persuadable, I don't mean persuadable to vote for Donald Trump, but persuadable to not vote for Hillary Clinton,"" she told the BBC.""So it was to deter them from going to the polls. And that is the type of tactics where you can use this information in order to persuade certain people to disengage from the political process.""She gave specific examples of her claims: ""We saw an old quote from Michelle Obama being turned into an advertisement that made it look like she was criticising Hillary for staying with her husband, who cheated on her, and that was being targeted at conservative women to get them to not support her.""An old 1996 speech by Hillary Clinton in which she talks about young black men joining gangs was targeted at African Americans, she said, to dissuade them from voting for the Democrat.Ms Kaiser said the personality profiling done by Cambridge Analytica was good at targeting ""people who are neurotic, and sending them fear-based messaging"".""Sending messages to people who were extroverted and open-minded wasn't very effective,"" she added.Some regard Ms Kaiser as an unreliable witness, and question whether her whistleblowing was done more to save herself than to expose the company she worked for.Prof David Carroll, a data privacy expert who also played a pivotal role in The Great Hack, told the BBC that he thought she was ""an important witness to history"".But he believes that in her book she ""obfuscates and omits key aspects, to protect her reputation and her friends"".In her BBC interview, Ms Kaiser addressed her critics: ""Most of those people have no idea how hard it is to be a whistleblower.""""I spent the past year and a half being unpaid, doing pro-bono work for governments around the world by being an expert witness... never knowing if I'd ever get a job again, never knowing if I was going to be persecuted or if I would be threatened with physical violence.""You really start to wonder who's going to come after you.""It is all a long way from when she entered the world of politics and data, in the Obama campaign, to ""figure out what got people excited about politics"".""I never expected when I joined a company that was going to teach me more advanced forms of data science, that there was going to be anything malicious about it,"" she said. ""It's never too late to decide to do the right thing.""Critics question what she did during her time at Cambridge Analytica. She has been accused of deploying Israeli hackers to influence the presidential election in Nigeria in 2015, something she denies.""In Nigeria I met with clients who are actually private businessmen, not the campaign itself, who wanted to fund an external campaign. And so I helped, put together a team and sent people out there. They were only there for three weeks, so nothing that they did was really that big or that effective,"" she told the BBC.And what of Alexander Nix, her former employer with whom she is portrayed as having an affectionate friendship in the Great Hack?She told the BBC she was no longer in contact with him - in fact a text message wishing her luck in her testimony to the UK parliament in 2016 was the last time she heard from him, she said.But she said she believes he is still involved in political consultancy work.""I hope he has learned from his mistakes and is working more ethically.""Listen to more of the BBC's interview with Brittany Kaiser on the BBC World Service's Business Daily."
technology	Blockchain bandits hit crypto start-ups	Power gamesLost chance	"In early September, developer Stephanie Kent watched the approach of Hurricane Hermine with growing trepidation.A hurricane making landfall is never welcome but it looked set to strike Ms Kent's home in Florida at the worst possible time.Back then, Ms Kent was fighting hackers seeking to take over her digital cash start-up Krypton - a services firm based around a variant of Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain.Ms Kent and her coding team had just recovered from one attack and had seen early signs that another was under way.""We were hit by the hurricane during the second attack,"" she says.Then, the savage storm knocked the power out.""That really didn't help,"" she says.Undeterred, Ms Kent decamped to a local convenience store, plugged in her laptop and got back to work battling the hackers.Krypton defeated them by drawing on some rarely-used features in the blockchain code which helped to thwart the attempted takeover. But that was not before the bad guys got away with virtual Krypton cash worth about $6,000 (£4,900).Ms Kent wasn't alone in getting hit. A similar attack, probably by the same group, was used against a separate crypto-currency start-up called Swift.""There are a lot of malicious actors in crypto-currency right now,"" says Ms Kent. ""It's the gunslinger era.""The amounts of money involved might be small but the attacks signal a growing interest by hackers in fledgling firms seeking to build businesses around blockchains and digital currencies.That is troubling given the current fever of interest in the blockchain. Many see it as the element of the Bitcoin crypto-currency that will have lasting influence.Visa has announced plans to launch a blockchain payments service in 2017, central banks are investigating the technology and many finance firms are keen to use it to keep track of the deals they do.The blockchain is the open accounting system underpinning Bitcoin. It involves large networks of computers working together to do the complicated cryptography-based maths that verifies who spent which bitcoins and where they spent them.For a well-established virtual currency such as Bitcoin, there are huge numbers of people helping crunch numbers via server farms they own and operate. The vast size of the processing pool means there is little chance that any individual will be able to amass enough computer power to subvert the blockchain and effectively print their own money.That's not the case with the fledgling crypto-currencies, says Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the University of Cambridge.""More than 600 different crypto-currencies have come out since Bitcoin emerged in 2009,"" he says. ""A lot of the crypto-currency knock-offs have been attacked.""Many of those attacks are aimed at the wallets where the digital cash is kept, but others have gone after the blockchains they use to keep track of transactions. By their nature, says Dr Hileman, these start-ups do not have many servers verifying who is spending or using what making them vulnerable to an attacker with processing power at their fingertips.""It's all about how much computer power you have,"" he says, adding that there are well-known defences against cyber thieves who try to hijack the system.""There are variations in how blockchains are made secure. Some are more vulnerable than others depending on the attack surface that's available.""Krypton and Swift were targeted because of the particular blockchain variant they used, he says.It's one that has proved popular with attackers since it was developed by a firm called Ethereum, which is looking to use the technology as the basis for its own business. One of Ethereum's offshoots, called the DAO, suffered a serious blockchain-based attack earlier this year.Ever since, this offshoot has been under repeated attack and last week instituted significant technical changes to thwart the hackers targeting it. It's not clear yet whether it worked.Many are tracking its success in defeating the hackers because of the backing Ethereum has won from venture capitalists and other investors. Millions of dollars in development cash is tied up in its crypto-currency network.That ability to adapt and change to defeat cyberthieves shows how blockchain technology can be made secure, says Prof Ari Juels, a computer scientist at Cornell Tech and co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts which studies the technology and its uses.""Ethereum has showed just how resilient crypto-currencies can be in the way that it has unwound the damage done by the attacker,"" he says, adding that it, and virtual currencies in general, are still going through some ""growing pains"".Prof Juels insists that the attacks on one variant of the blockchain technology should not scupper all interest in the field.To begin with, he says, the types of blockchains that governments, central banks and other financial institutions are planning to use have a fundamental difference that will stymie attempts to attack them.Instead of being open to anyone who buys in, these permission-based networks are open only to the organisations involved in the particular financial instrument or sector they serve.""It's maintained and run by a set of predetermined and trustworthy partners,"" he says. ""There are huge advantages to the closed systems not only because they are more resilient to attack and not vulnerable to processor-power based attacks.""But, says Prof Juels, that desire for control and security might limit the ultimate usefulness of blockchains to the banking world.""Banks are interested in blockchains but they are using them in a very rudimentary way,"" he says.

"The government has quietly launched a bold experiment using the technology behind the virtual currency Bitcoin - and, if anybody notices, it could prove hugely controversial. That is because the trial involves the payment of benefits and could conceivably involve very sensitive data being made public - or at least that's the concern of some critics.There is a huge amount of excitement around now about the Blockchain, with endless academic studies and a good deal of investment reinforcing the belief that a permanent ever-expanding and tamper-proof online ledger of transactions must have all sorts of wider applications.Earlier this year the government's chief scientific advisor Mark Walport wrote a report on blockchain - or distributed ledger technology - which was enthusiastic about its potential to produce ""disruptive innovations that could transform the delivery of public and private services and enhance productivity through a wide range of applications."" He recommended that the government should back trials of the technology while also looking carefully at the security and privacy implications of using it.Now, the first real trial is underway, revealed without any fanfare by the welfare minister Lord Freud at a conference last week.The Department of Work and Pensions tell me it began in May, will run for up to six months, and is designed to look at how the technology might help benefit claimants manage their money. Up to 24 welfare claimants will use an app provided by a company called Govcoin to track their spending.But this news sounded alarm bells amongst some of those who have been involved in framing the government's technology policies. Their concern is that the payment of benefits is not the right place to start this journey of blockchain exploration.One recently departed member of the Government Digital Service told me of his amazement that this trial was being allowed to go ahead. His most serious concern was about the privacy implications of putting highly sensitive personal data on a shared ledger ""which, by technical design, can never be changed or deleted even if it's inaccurate"".He also has a theory that the trial - though billed as a way for claimants to manage their money better - could also be ""a potentially efficient way for DWP to restrict, audit and control exactly what each benefits payment is actually spent on, without the government being perceived as a big brother"".He sees the possibility that in the future the government could then use the technology to force people to spend benefits on certain things - to make sure, for instance that pensioners spent their winter fuel allowance on their energy bills.""[That would be a] highly political idea. To hide it behind hyped up blockchain technobabble is not on,"" he said.It seems there is also concern in Whitehall about the process by which this trial came to be approved. The chief scientific advisor had wanted a Cabinet Office committee to vet all the various blockchain ideas coming out of different government departments.It seems that committee has yet to be formed, but another insider has indicated to me that if it had been, the DWP trial would have been quite far down the list for approval.I put these criticisms to the Department for Work and Pensions.I was told that any data involved in the trial would be handled by the private company running it and personal information would be removed before it reached the department.""There are no plans to replace any DWP payment systems,"" a spokesman said.""This trial is designed to explore how distributed ledger technology could help support financial inclusion and offer budgeting help, and it does not place any restrictions or limits on what a claimant can spend their welfare payments on, nor tracks how they spend them.""There is plenty of enthusiasm for the potential of blockchain to deliver improvements to public services - albeit some time in the quite distant future. But the worry now is that if the first trials go down the wrong path, then public trust in the technology could be irredeemably damaged."
technology	Big banks consider using Bitcoin blockchain technology		The basic technology underpinning the Bitcoin virtual currency could be used by some of the world's biggest banks.Nine banks, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs, may adopt the blockchain system that logs who spends which virtual coins in an ever-expanding computer equivalent of a ledger.The banks want to use the blockchain method because it is hard to fool - making fraud more difficult.It could also speed up trading systems and make deals more transparent.The project to test blockchain-like technology is being led by financial technology firm R3 which has signed nine banks up to the initiative.The other seven are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.Technical meetings with the banks had prompted discussion of how it could be used within banks' trading arms, said David Rutter, head of R3 in an interview with Reuters.For Bitcoin, the blockchain acts as a globally-distributed ledger that logs transactions. Everyone involved with the virtual currency contributes to the way the blockchain verifies each deal. The sheer number of people involved makes it very hard for one bitcoin user to get fraudulent deals verified and approved.Despite this, Bitcoin has been hit by a series of scandals and thefts although most of these came about because hackers exploited weaknesses on exchanges where coins are traded or in digital wallets where they are held.Mr Rutter said the banks were most interested in the technical architecture underpinning the blockchain that could be adapted for their own ends. The first place the blockchain was likely to find a role was as a log of who bought which stocks or shares, he said.By adopting the technology banks could cut the cost of reporting transactions and working out who bought what and when, he added.No timetable has been given for when technical trials of the blockchain-like technology might begin.
technology	Bitcoin's baby: Blockchain's 'tamper-proof' revolution	What's their business model?OK. So, what is a Blockchain?This file must get pretty big?Other than payments, what else can the Blockchain be used for?That's pretty transparentSo, how would I get my government to put its data through a Blockchain?	"For Bitcoin, 2014 was not a good year. The virtual currency's value slumped as scandal after scandal struck, resulting in many people losing significant amounts of money.Over recent months the ""cryptocurrency"" has stabilised, however it is still worth less than a quarter of its peak value against the dollar.But while Bitcoin's long-term prospects may remain in doubt, some are suggesting that its underlying technology - the Blockchain - has a bright future.Blockchain businesses take the technology that underpins Bitcoin - the Blockchain - and use it for things the virtual currency's unidentified creator, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", never envisaged when he first published his system for a ""truly peer-to-peer electronic cash system"".In Bitcoin, the Blockchain is used to store financial transactions.The emerging Blockchain companies believe it can be used for much more.The new projects have been dubbed ""Bitcoin 2.0"" - but some Blockchain evangelists are wary of the term because of negative associations with Bitcoin.In Bitcoin the Blockchain is a ledger.Imagine walking into the head office of a bank some 80 years ago. Arranged along shelves are a number of hefty, leather-bound books.You take one down, blow the dust from the cover and open it up. This is the ledger, and each page contains a number of lines, and on each line is listed a transaction: a credit here, a debit there.The Blockchain is simply a representation of this ledger in the form of an ever-expanding computer file. You can think of a block in the Blockchain representing a page in the ledger.Other characteristics of the Blockchain are:The uncoordinated nature of the network is what keeps it honest.To corrupt the system - in other words to hack it - you would have to commandeer more than 50% of the computers on the system. More on this later.It does.""Blockchain bloat"" is a problem the Bitcoin community is already trying to address.At the time of writing, the current size of the Blockchain is a touch under 36GB.For comparisons sake, that's more storage than many smartphones provide, and enough to fill more than 50 standard CD-Roms.Just about any kind of data you can think of that is transactional in nature and requires immutability - ie information that absolutely cannot be changed after it has been created.A good example is land titles.Texas-based Factom is working with a Central American client to try to get their system for registering land titles into a Blockchain.According to Factom president Peter Kirby, this country had ""built a database of all their land title records and some bureaucrats got hold of that and they started giving themselves beachfront property"".He added: ""With Blockchain technology, you could create a truly tamper-proof record system. Those land title records can go into the Blockchain in a way that I know if anybody tries to change it.""Other candidates for insertion into the Blockchain include contracts, royalty payments, certificates for authenticating art and even government budgets.Can I look at a Blockchain?Yes you can.You can download the Bitcoin Blockchain at any time and view transactions in near real-time.Alternatively visit www.blockexplorer.com and use its simplified interface. Just type in a random block number to view the transactions contained within that block.Sure is.And for many this is the most crucial point of all: the Blockchain lacks a central, controlling authority.With banks, it's the bank that acts as the sole arbiter of the validity of the ledger.With land, it's the officials controlling the registry.Both are examples of what techies are fond of calling a single point of failure.Anti-corruption group Transparency International says there is great potential in a Blockchain's ability to bypass the need for such traditional ""gatekeepers"".""Corruption appears when you have a monopoly, somebody with discretionality to decide and when you have opacity,"" Alejandro Sales, the body's regional director for the Americas tells the BBC.Not so fast.The Blockchain's distributed nature and the ability for anyone in the world with a powerful enough computer to participate is both its strength and weakness.According to the theory, so long as nodes - programs that validate transactions and blocks - don't cooperate to break the system, all goes to plan.But when it comes to putting all this into practice, one Harvard internet law professor thinks he has spotted a flaw.""Why would we assume that now and forever no one entity could command more than half of the computing power of the people mining a Blockchain?"" asks Prof Jonathan Zittrain.""I haven't really heard a satisfying answer to that."""
technology	Android pioneer HTC stages retreat from China	Blockchain phones	"HTC is pulling its smartphones from two of China's largest online marketplaces, raising concerns about the brand's future.The firm was the first to sell an Android handset in 2008.But it has seen its global share of the smartphone market drop from a peak of 10.7% in 2011 to 0.05% today, according to market research firm IDC.However, the Taiwanese company has said it still intends to release at least one new model later this year.HTC posted a message to Weibo - a Twitter-like service popular in China - on Friday declaring that it was closing its online shops on Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com's Jingdong.A spokeswoman told the BBC there was nothing further to add at this time.The two stores account for hundreds of millions of customers.Although HTC described the move as being temporary, it gave no indication as to when it might restore the operations or any explanation for the move, beyond saying it was in line with a ""long-term business strategy"".The company has already reduced its activity elsewhere.In the UK, for example, Carphone Warehouse, O2 and EE no longer offer its handsets, leaving HTC reliant on its own website and Amazon to drive sales.One expert said it was now questionable how long the business would continue to be an active smartphone-maker.""All the signs are that it's not viable for them to do business in China, and China is one of the markets which has the potential to provide the volume that companies like HTC need to survive in the smartphone business,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.""If you look at the West, companies like Oppo, Xiaomi, and Huawei are all prepared to make significant marketing investments to support their product ranges.""And that's something that HTC just can't afford to do.""HTC posted a 11.6bn Taiwanese dollar ($372m; £285m) net loss over the 12 months leading up to April.However, its balance sheet shows it still has a sizeable cash cushion of 29.3bn Taiwanese dollars, thanks in part to the sale of much of its smartphone design team to Google last year. The engineers now work on the search giant's Pixel range.The focus of HTC's current efforts is virtual reality. It recently launched a headset that does not need to be tethered to a PC - the Vive Focus Plus.In February, it also unveiled a 5G hub to provide homes and offices with use of next-generation mobile networks.Despite the loss-making nature of its smartphone division, HTC has, however, signalled that it is not yet ready to give up on the business.On Saturday, one of its executives said that HTC remained committed to releasing a follow-up to the Exodus 1 - a so-called ""blockchain phone"" that provides a hardware wallet and tools to manage owners' crypto-currencies.Phil Chen took part at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York, where he said that the forthcoming device would be both cheaper than its predecessor and capable of verifying blockchain transactions.But Mr Wood is unconvinced of the product's appeal.""It appears that HTC has accepted that it can't really compete in the mainstream mobile market any more,"" he said.""And quite frankly, it's hard to believe that that the blockchain phone is anything more than a curiosity.""While Google has provided them with a cash injection... that money won't last forever."""
technology	Binance exchange hackers steal bitcoins worth $41m	'Patient hackers'	"Hackers have stolen $41m (£31m) worth of Bitcoin in a major crypto-currency heist.The Binance exchange, which stores Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies for members, said hackers took 7,000 bitcoins in one go. Withdrawals have now been suspended on the platform.""We beg for your understanding in this difficult situation,"" Binance said.However, the exchange said it would replace the lost cash with the help of its emergency insurance fund.According to Binance, the attackers used a variety of techniques to break in. They deployed viruses and used phishing attacks to get security information.This eventually allowed them to access the exchange's ""hot wallet"", an online cache of bitcoins readily available for customer transactions.The hot wallet contained about 2% of Binance's total crypto-currency assets. Other wallets were ""secure and unharmed"", the firm said.The hackers ""had the patience to wait"" and acquire access to a number of accounts before withdrawing the huge haul of bitcoins, according to Binance.""It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed,"" the company's statement read.""Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system.""We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that.""Now, the ability to withdraw funds from the exchange has been disabled and may not be restored until next week.In a live video chat, Binance's chief executive Changpeng Zhao sought to answer questions about the hack.""I haven't really slept much for the last 29 hours,"" he said. ""To be honest I don't feel that well… it's not a great day.""However, he told Binance users that he and his colleagues were working to secure the exchange and prevent any further hacks.And he added that he was asking other exchanges to block bitcoins associated with the hacked wallet from being transferred elsewhere, which would render them largely useless.While Binance is one of the largest crypto-currency exchanges, the heist is not the largest the Bitcoin world has seen.In 2014, Mt Gox was hacked to the tune of $470m.""Blockchain businesses will need to implement controls more commonly seen in the traditional banking sector if they are to win over consumers,"" said cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House.""Cyber-insurance is a common necessity today as identify theft, malware and cyber-attacks are frequently being performed against high-value blockchain and crypto-currency companies."""
technology	Facebook’s Libra pitches to be the future of money	Who is it for?Is this really a global project?How does Facebook make money from it?What do the partners get out of it?Why is it a cryptocurrency and why does it need the blockchain?Why will anyone trust it?Cryptocurrency timeline:	"It is a hugely ambitious - some might say megalomaniacal - project to create a new global currency. Facebook's David Marcus tells me it is about giving billions of people more freedom with money and ""righting the many wrongs of the present system"".The message is this is not some little side project a small team at the Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters will try out for a few months before moving on to something else - this is both the future of Facebook and the future of money, an initiative that has seen an alliance of big players in payments such as Paypal and Visa, Silicon Valley players such as Uber and Lyft and major venture capital firms, a kind of Avengers: Endgame of technology and finance superheroes come together to make the world a better place.But there are still many questions about FaceCoin - or Libra as the company wants us to call it. The principal one I keep coming back to is - why? As in why do we need a new global currency and do we really want it from Facebook?The Libra mission statement makes great play of the 1.7 billion people who do not have a bank account and how expensive it is for them to transfer money to relatives. But there are already plenty of organisations addressing this issue, from Kenya's Mpesa scheme to technology start-ups such as WorldRemit.What is not clear is how exactly Libra will go through the complex business of verifying the identity of these people to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, without incurring lots of costs.""Compliance is the really hard and expensive part,"" says a man who has worked for a couple of money transfer companies.And this will apply not just to unbanked Facebook users in Kenya but to lucrative markets such as the United States and Britain, where national identity cards do not exist as a relatively easy way of verifying someone is who they say they are.If Libra does allow people to send money from their phones as simply as they send a text, that will prove very attractive. But doing this cheaply and in a secure fashion will be extremely challenging.Facebook, perhaps aware of the reputational issues it faces, appears very keen to stress Libra is a global coalition in which it is just one little player.Sceptics recall Facebook launched its global internet access scheme, Internet.org, as a similar international coalition. Then it became the controversial Free Basics service, denounced in India as a vehicle solely designed to promote the interests of Facebook.Since then, the other coalition partners seem to have melted away.There will be what Facebook describes as a ""negligible"" fee for every transaction, mainly, it says, to stop the network being spammed by millions of back and forth payments in a denial-of-service attack.Through its Calibra subsidiary, the social giant may eventually seek to offer users additional financial services. But the real prize is simply making people spend longer on Facebook or WhatsApp so that they can be served more adverts.It is being reported that partners such as Paypal, Mastercard and Visa are paying $10m (£8m) each for the privilege of operating a node in the Libra network. It seems bizarre they would want to support an organisation whose whole pitch is it can do a better job than them.But, then again, they will have access to the data flowing across the network, albeit in pseudonymous form, and that should give them valuable insights into what is being spent and where.Facebook insists that Facecoin - sorry, Libra - will have all the benefits of Bitcoin without the downside. It will be ""global and instantaneous"" like the original cryptocurrency but also secure and stable. And because it does not rely on mining, it will not have a major environmental impact.But Bitcoin sceptic David Gerard says it is not clear why Libra is being implemented as a cryptocurrency - or needs a blockchain, an immutable distributed ledger visible to anyone.""The usual reason for saying 'blockchain' is to lend magical marketing dust to unmagical ideas,"" he says.""But Libra is intended to be a service people use - so it'll stand or fall on being useful and convenient, not whether it has a buzzword.""This of course is the 64,000 Libra question - why, after Cambridge Analytica and other data scandals, would people want to trust Facebook with their money or give it a key role in running a global currency?Facebook says its Calibra subsidiary will keep financial and social data strictly separate and users will not be targeted with adverts based on their spending habits.But, yet again, the main defence is this is a global coalition, not Mark Zuckerberg's new plan to rule the world.""It is Facebook-led initiative, yes,"" Mr Marcus tells me.""But by the time it comes to market next year, it won't be a Facebook-controlled initiative. We'll have the exact same voting rights as all the other members.""You may not trust us, is Facebook's pitch, but you should trust Visa, Paypal, Uber and the rest.So don't expect Mark Zuckerberg's head to be on the Libra, if they ever decide to strike a commemorative coin.October 2008:A White Paper is published detailing how to set up Bitcoin, which it described as a ""purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"". Its author - credited as Satoshi Nakamoto - has never been publicly identified.January 2009:Bitcoin comes into existence, with creation of its so-called genesis block. About a week later, software is released for Windows PCs to make possible trade in the asset, after which Satoshi Nakamoto carries out the first transaction, sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, Hal Finney.October 2011:Litecoin becomes the second major cryptocurrency to launch.

Later the same month, Bitcoin reaches its record peak to date, of just over $19,783 (£15,800).December 2018:Bitcoin hits a post-peak low of about $3,300 after a turbulent year for the sector at large."
technology	Crypto for care homes - really?	'Special risks'Cautionary advice	"Thought the crypto-currency and blockchain craze had faded away?Think again.In recent weeks, messages about all sorts of schemes involving creating new coins and exploiting the wondrous blockchain technology have popped into my inbox.The most bizarre of all was from a company planning to get residents of upmarket care homes to pay for their rooms using a new crypto-currency.Carlauren Group, which describes itself as the ""UK's leading innovator"" of care services, was creating what it called the C-Coin.In the email's next paragraph the excitement mounted: ""This breakthrough blockchain technology will provide all residents at Carlauren's Lifestyle Resorts and Care Homes with a safe and secure currency, whilst also removing the worry that's associated with carrying cash"".The scheme involves residents buying C-Coins for £70 each, the price of one night in a Carlauren care home or resort, separate from the costs of care. The company says the unusual thing about the coins is that it will always guarantee to buy them back at £63, so the risk of investing in any crypto-currency is largely avoided.This is painted as an innovative way of allowing well-off elderly people and their children to invest in their room for the long term - a kind of timeshare scheme which would then be tradable because the coins could be sold on an exchange.""I wanted to crystallize the payment of the room for the foreseeable future,"" Carlauren's chief executive Sean Murray explained to me. He outlined a membership scheme whereby residents who were currently paying between £1,250 and £1,500 a week would buy their room with the tokens, and it would be an asset for their children after they died.""We see an opportunity with family members that are obviously wisely aware of what's happening in the crypto-market - that has an intrinsic value.""But for that intrinsic value to exist, the C-Coin has to be open to external investors through an Initial Coin Offering or ICO. Carlauren is issuing 500,000 coins raising £35m, although Mr Murray insists that his firm has no need to raise funds.There is a Carlauren Coins Exchange and a White Paper you can download full of purple prose about the wonders of blockchain technology - ""arguably the largest technological revolution since the internet"" - though with little detail about what role it plays here.We also learn that Carlauren was only founded in 2015 but is ""now one of the UK's leading innovators of long-term residential later life and care services"".This business does not, however, appear particularly lucrative. The very limited and unaudited accounts filed for Carlauren Group at Companies House show that it had net liabilities in 2017 of £610,475, up from £141,898 the previous year.The firm's chief financial officer, David Bruce, told me: ""Carlauren Group has substantial assets under its control and it has an ambitious development programme aimed at delivering a high-end leisure and care service package to its residents. We are confident that this can be achieved with the resources at our disposal.""The ICO White Paper does contain this warning: ""The purchase of Carlauren coins may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of the purchase amount. The purchase of Carlauren Coins is considered speculative in nature and it involves a high degree of risk.""So that guarantee that coins will be bought back at £63 is not set in stone - if Carlauren goes bust, your coins will be worthless.When I headed to the Carlauren Coin Exchange I found that anyone can sign up to buy coins, with no apparent checks, so I decided to try it out. The exchange showed there had been just a handful of transactions so far and nearly all of the 500,000 coins were still available to buy at £70.Curiously, the exchange also listed a market price for the coin of £189. So with a couple of clicks I bought one coin for £70 and immediately sold it - or so I thought - for £189.The next day I found that while £70 had been debited from my bank account, the £189 had not arrived. When I looked at my account on the exchange my sale was listed as ""pending"" - presumably nobody is going to buy my coin off me at £189 when there are still 499,953 available at £70.Minutes after my purchase, an email was sent to me - and I presume all of those who had signed up to the exchange - notifying us that someone had bought a coin. It read as follows:""We want to let you know that someone has just bought 1 C-Coins at £70/1 C-Coin.""The current market price of one C-Coin is £189.0017/1 C-Coin.""There are still available a total of 499,955 C-Coins on market at price of £70/1 C-Coin.""Is time to buy or to sell?""Now this struck me as misleading, an invitation to buy C-Coins on the understanding that you might be able to sell at an instant profit.When I contacted Sean Murray he explained that this £189.0017 market price would only be available once all 500,000 coins had been sold. That price had been calculated using a formula I confess I did not fully understand, but he agreed that the wording on the exchange website needed to be clearer.I am well aware of how risky crypto-currency investment is, but are the elderly residents of care homes really ready to enter this world? I approached a number of regulators, from the Care Quality Commission to the Financial Conduct Authority for comment but they explained that as crypto-currencies are not regulated in the UK there was not much they could say.They did point me towards the Competition and Markets Authority which said it could not comment on any particular case but had this cautionary advice:""Requiring care home residents to pay for goods or services in crypto-currency may raise potential consumer protection concerns.""I went back to Sean Murray with a simple question - how would he defend the marketing of the Carlauren Coin to his residents?""I believe that the future of how transactions are made for goods is changing towards crypto-type transactions,"" he told me. ""No-one likes change but we have to move with the times , our younger generation will become older and it takes visionaries such as myself to make these changes.""Throughout our conversation, Sean Murray repeatedly referred to himself as a visionary, insisting I had underestimated just how innovative Carlauren's plans were.He says 1,500 people a week are getting in touch to inquire about membership so we will find out soon how many buy into his vision."
technology	Facebook urged to pause Libra crypto-currency project		"A US lawmaker has said Facebook should delay the launch of its Libra crypto-currency - hours after the social network formally announced the project.Libra, set to be launched next year, will let people make payments via Facebook's apps and WhatsApp.But the company should wait until the US Congress has examined the project, according to the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee.Facebook said it looked forward to responding to policymakers' questions.""Given the company's troubled past, I am requesting that Facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a crypto-currency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action,"" said Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters.She cited the firm's history of controversies involving user-data among her concerns, and called on Facebook's executives to testify before her committee.""We look forward to responding to policymakers' questions as this process moves forward,"" a Facebook spokesman said.Facebook plans to allow its users to buy Libra and store it online in a digital wallet called Calibra. It would then be transferable between users and could eventually be used to pay bills or buy things.US Senator Sherrod Brown, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said he thought Facebook had become ""too big and too powerful"".""We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new crypto-currency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight,"" he said in a statement.UK regulators are not yet waving a red flag in front of the Facebook crypto-currency train - but they are making it clear that if it does gather speed they will want to step in. Or as Bank of England governor Mark Carney said yesterday about the crypto-market in general: ""Anything that works in this world will become instantly systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation.""If Libra wants to be a big player in the UK's payments system it will have to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and show that it knows who its customers are and that it has strong anti-money-laundering controls. Existing money-transfer firms say complying with all the rules can be an onerous and expensive business.That said, I detect some scepticism amongst the regulators about the prospects for Facebook's currency in the UK. One official pointed out that the UK already had a cheap, fast and efficient payment system. ""It's not obvious why someone here would choose to hold Libra with some exchange rate risk, when they could use pounds. ""They also point out that the Libra blockchain is still under development and there is little detail about how the system will work. That said, if this does turn out to be the future of money, there will be all sorts of consequences for the world economy, so the regulators are going to keep a close eye on how the project develops.According to a letter seen by the Financial Times, the G7 nations plan to set up a working group to evaluate the risks of currencies like Libra.The participants will examine, for example, the potential for Libra to be exploited by money-launderers.It's not yet clear how many of Facebook's 2.38 billion users worldwide would make use of Libra - but given the size of the social network, it is possible that the crypto-currency could become a significant financial force."
technology	The crypto-currencies that die before they have bloomed		"It has been the biggest craze in investment of the last two years - the idea that creating your own crypto-currency through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the route to riches.But now an academic study has revealed just how many of these ICOs end up disappearing without trace after a short while.A Boston College research paper entitled Digital Tulips finds that fewer than half of these projects survive more than 120 days after the completion of their sales of tokens to the public.The researchers arrived at this conclusion by examining the official Twitter accounts of the crypto-currencies. They found only 44.2% of them were still tweeting after that four-month period and concluded that the rest of the ICOs had died.Mind you, the study also finds that the ICO gold rush is continuing, with $12bn raised from more than 4,000 ICOs since January 2017 - and those investors who got in and out quickly made big profits.Maybe it is not surprising then that the excitement about crypto-currencies and the blockchain technology which underpins them continues to reach new heights,One example is an advert which has probably bemused millions of viewers of ITV's World Cup coverage. The ad, played during half-time, features a cosy home scene where all the domestic appliances appear to be trading energy with each other.A caption says: ""Hdac Technology is building the future with the blockchain solution."" Hdac, a South Korean blockchain business, must be paying a fortune to place the adverts in the most expensive slots of the year.But even if anyone understands what on earth they are about, it seems unlikely they are going to rush out and buy a blockchain to get their microwave to talk to the kettle.Maybe, however, they will think they need to go on a course to understand this brave new world. If so, two of Britain's most prestigious academic institutions can help.The Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme, run by the University and its Said Business School, offers you a six-week online course for just £2,200, promising you will emerge with ""a comprehensive understanding of what blockchain is and how it works"".On top of that, you get a certificate of attendance from the Said Business School as well as ""access to a global network of like-minded business leaders and innovators"".The Financial Times has been reporting on an even more exciting opportunity, a London School of Economics course in ""Cryptocurrency, Investment and Disruption"" - and this comes with a bargain price tag of just £1,800 for the six-week online programme.When the reporter has the temerity to suggest that the programme seems to be lacking in academic rigour and may be tempting people into the unregulated world of crypto-trading, she is told this by one of the course leaders: ""Stop being a journalist and just think. You're citing marketing material as if that were the ultimate truth.""Judging by my inbox, the volume of marketing material about crypto-currencies and especially blockchain is expanding at an exponential rate. And I have a sneaking suspicion that finding the ""ultimate truth"" in this mountain of hype is not going to be easy."
technology	Maybe Facebook will be punished after all	'We cannot accept a new currency''Change is here'	"Many were left wholly unsatisfied by news that the punishment for Facebook's privacy misdeeds, from the US at least, would be set at $5bn - an amount the firm can well afford, and for which it had already mostly accounted.The mood among the network’s critics: Mark Zuckerberg has gotten away with it.But if there is to be a real punishment for Facebook, we may have seen it playing out in Washington DC this week.Facebook’s ambitions to launch a cryptocurrency represents the biggest project the company has undertaken since the dorm-room conception of Facebook itself. Over two congressional hearings this week, Facebook’s David Marcus repeated the potential benefits: easier money transfer around the world, and the chance to reach more than one billion “unbanked” people.But such is the animosity towards Facebook in Washington DC today, the firm may not be allowed to launch it at all. It would be a big blow to the company’s desire - and necessity - to diversify the way it makes its money, at a time when the relative freedom to gather personal data with the intent to sell advertising is coming under threat.As Facebook’s army of lobbyists will know, even in divided America, stifling the network’s power is apparently one of the few surviving bipartisan goals. Every move Facebook now makes will draw concern from lawmakers, even if the idea in isolation appears to be worth exploring.“Just because we may not fully understand a technology proposal,” remarked Republican Patrick McHenry, “does not mean we should immediately call for its prohibition.“But let’s face it. Let’s be honest… it’s Facebook.”A draft bill entitled “Keep Big Tech Out of Finance”, seeks to ban any technology company with yearly revenues in excess of $25bn (£20bn) from entering the finance sector. Realistically, it’s too sweeping a measure to pass, but it does draw attention to a determination here to not let Facebook’s next moves go unchecked.And that’s a feeling which extends beyond the US. Just as hearings were taking place in Washington DC, finance ministers from the G7 countries were meeting in Chantilly, near Paris.Italy’s finance minister told reporters he would move to keep Facebook in check, seeing Facebook’s ambitions in this space as a move to “control what’s going on”.His French equivalent, Bruno Le Maire, was similarly concerned. You might even say incensed.""I would say this is first of all a question of sovereignty,” he told reporters. ""You have states, the United States, France, Germany, Italy - all sovereign states with sovereign currencies: dollar, euro and so on and they are sticking to some very strong commitments, some very strong rules.“We cannot accept a new currency having the exact same kind of power, without the same kind of rules, without the same kind of commitments and without the same kind of obligations.”Like US lawmakers, he’s concerned about the use of Libra to fund terrorism, buy illegal goods, or launder money. It’s not hyperbole - many cryptocurrencies, most famously Bitcoin, have been used for such purposes.Mr Le Maire said: ""How could we accept to have now a new currency which wouldn’t stick to the same kind of obligation?”Facebook feels it will be able to build in sufficient protections to address the concern. For starters, those who use Facebook’s own wallet - Calibra - to trade the Libra currency, must upload a government ID, removing the anonymity afforded by other digital currencies.More broadly, David Marcus said, the Libra currency ultimately won’t be fully controlled by Facebook - it is one of dozens of companies and groups that have a say in how Libra will be set up, managed and secured.Facebook will have no dominant position (though as the biggest player, you could argue Facebook will command one, even if it isn’t technically in charge)Mr Marcus also, repeatedly over the two days, pressed the argument that if Facebook doesn’t do this - someone else will, implying China, where companies very much outside of US scrutiny and control could move into this space.“Whether Libra launches, or if it doesn’t launch, there will be other networks,” he said. ""There are other networks.”This, more so than any other argument from Mr Marcus, will resonate. Appearing tough on Facebook is a vote-winning position for sure, but stifling American innovation in a way which boosts China would certainly take precedent.""The reality is that whether Facebook is involved or not, change is here,” said Senator McHenry.""Digital currencies exist. Blockchain technology is real, and Facebook’s entry into this world is just confirmation.”Facebook has said it won’t launch without regulatory approval. A spokeswoman at the firm would not say if the company would launch for users outside the US if was able to get approval elsewhere - a move that would upset regulators here immensely, you’d imagine.Either way, the company's stated aim of launching as soon as next year seems ambitious. And that’s a lot more painful than a $5bn fine._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	CES 2019: Preparing for take-off		"Can you detect a low moaning sound coming from Nevada? Yes, it's that time of year again.Technology journalists have descended on Las Vegas for CES and are complaining bitterly about the cost of hotels, the queues for taxis, and the sheer volume of silly new products - everything from an internet-of-things cat toilet to a crypto-currency-mining piggy bank.Yet for all the whingeing - and I'm an enthusiastic participant - we know that CES provides an essential guide to what's hot and what's not in technology.If my first few hours here are anything to go by this year's show will be dominated by smart home devices, AI, autonomous and connected cars - and the question of how big a role China should be allowed to play in shaping our technology future.My very first press conference featured just about all of those themes. And Byton, the electric car-maker backed by Chinese investors with deep pockets, seemed determined to play Buzzword Bingo.Showing off the M-Byte, a car with a touchscreen tablet embedded in the steering wheel, Byton executives told us this was going to be the most important device in our lives, it was going to use AI to transform every journey, it would leverage an ""open-ended flexible architecture"" and it would have level 3 autonomy built in.Roughly translated, this means they are building a vehicle with some nifty features that will be able to drive itself a lot of the time, while keeping its occupants informed and entertained in traffic jams.The cynic in me wonders why they could not have said that in plain English - and why they are boasting about level 3 autonomy when much of the automotive world now thinks that is a dangerous middle ground where neither the car nor the driver is in complete control.But then I marvel at a company born just a couple of years ago having the ambition - and the cash - to believe it can deliver a world-beating electric car by the end of 2019.This show will have more Chinese exhibitors than ever, though the trade tensions with the US will cast a shadow, and one of the biggest players Huawei seems determined to keep a low profile.With the company viewed with deep suspicion by the US, its executives were keen to promote a new notebook computer when we met them, less eager to talk about the politics of marketing a brand American consumers have been told not to trust.Next stop was CES Unveiled, a bun fight where dozens of tech companies vie to gain the attention of journalists two days before the show opens.There were Japanese robots without any practical purpose except to serve as cuddly pets, there was a French bathroom mirror that could spot when you appeared in front of it looking rough and give you a stern talking to, there was an American mini bread factory that took flour, yeast and water and turned out finished loaves 90 minutes later.But what caught my eye was a simple piece of wood, something that at first looked as though it had wandered in from Ikea.The Mui interactive plank is, however, connected to the internet and acts as an interface for your connected devices, allowing you to control the music and the lights or find out the weather forecast.The idea is that it is a ""calm"" device allowing the technology to merge into the background most of the time - though a $679 (£533) price tag may receive a less-than-placid response from most householders.Our final stop was at a villa on the outskirts of Las Vegas, once apparently occupied by boxer Mike Tyson. A Rolls Royce and a yellow Lamborghini were on the drive while inside, a diverse crowd was entertained by live music and various virtual reality experiences.This was the CoinAgenda Showcase, apparently designed to promote crypto-currencies and the blockchain.I tried my usual trick of asking people to explain blockchain but apart from being told that it was going to change the world in various undefined ways I emerged none the wiser. One of them did, however, tell me that the Lamborghini was his, the fruits of an early investment in Bitcoin.Update 8 January 2019:Huawei has been in touch to say the company is ""not trying to avoid having the difficult conversations"". Indeed a Huawei executive based in New York will be talking to the BBC later this week about the political issues, but the representatives at CES were not qualified to talk about anything outside their product areas.But with the value of crypto-currencies plunging and blockchain projects failing so far to deliver on the hype, their promoters may struggle to make their voices heard above the hubbub of CES."
technology	Magical Money - the ICO crypto-currency boom	Exotic carsPlaced on hold	"Violet Lim wants to get rich by marrying together internet dating and the latest investment craze.""Our ICO is about love on the blockchain,"" the founder of Viola.ai exclaims.""You can use it to get curated matches, to buy flowers, to book restaurants or even get dating and relationship advice.""ICOs - or initial coin offerings to give them their full name - are a way to raise funds by creating a new form of money from thin air.And in the radio documentary Magical Money we try to find out whether this is a revolution in finance or a bubble that is already bursting.Singapore-based Violet has been involved in the internet dating industry for years.But she believes an ICO presents a way to raise $17m (£12.6m) from investors, who will get tokens to use in their dating activities.Why, I want to know, do you need a token to buy flowers for your loved one and why does the service have to be on this magical blockchain which apparently solves every problem?""We are trying to solve a very important problem in our industry, which is the lack of trust,"" she replies.And she explains that by entering people's details on an immutable blockchain, Viola will be able to deal with ""love scammers"" who hide their true identity.But her enthusiasm gives way to a degree of despondency soon after, when Google bans crypto-currency and ICO ads on the very day Viola's public sale gets started.""[It's been] a very bad first day followed by a very bad first week,"" a more muted Violet tells me.Violet is one of dozens of ICO-dependent company founders we first met at an event called London Blockchain Week in January.They were all convinced of two things: that fashionable blockchain technology could revolutionise just about every industry on earth, and that huge profits could be made by creating new currencies to fund this wave of disruption.""There's a craze going on,"" says the event's organiser Luis Carranza.""It might be a hype cycle, but it also could be the beginning of a new industrial revolution.""He explains that an ICO involves both creating a new crypto-currency or token like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and selling investors on the idea that these coins will be the foundations on which radical new blockchain projects will be based.In the programme we follow Viola's fortunes as well as those of another project.""Bitcar is a new decentralised platform,"" explains founder Gov van Ek.""And on there will be high-end exotic cars and people will be able to acquire a fractional interest in those cars.""Investors will never be able to drive the McLarens and Ferraris that Bitcar will one day acquire.But the idea is that the tokens they obtain via an ICO aiming to raise $25m (£18.5m) will rise in value along with the automobiles.A belief in the power of blockchain - essentially a database shared across multiple computers where every new entry is added to an unchangeable log - has seen billions of dollars invested in ICOs over the past 18 months.But finance blogger and former banker Frances Coppola has a warning: ""I'm not saying there isn't value in blockchain, but the way it is getting hyped is ridiculous.""We asked her to look at the Bitcar and Viola ICOs, and she was not impressed.Of Viola she asked: ""What's the point?""And she was not convinced by Violet Lim's assertion that the blockchain would make dating more secure""Why on earth would I want my entire dating history up on a public blockchain where everyone could see it?""Turning to Bitcar, she insisted the fractional car ownership scheme was no more or less than a derivatives market with all the risk that entails.""If people want to gamble on tokens that might or might not have some hard asset backing which might or might not go up in value, then by all means don't stop them - but it's a derivative.""In Magical Money we also travel to one tiny country that is so enthusiastic about ICOs that even the government has considered having one.Or rather the smart young group of officials that came up with Estonia's e-residency programme, which allows anyone to set up a business in the country, have now floated the idea of a crypto-currency called Estcoins.One of the team tells me the Estcoin concept had flown higher than they had ever thought possible - but reaction was mixed.""Mostly people wanting to invest - but there was a lot of criticism from high government officials,"" explains Ott Vatte.The country's central bank pointed out last year that Estonia was part of the eurozone, and so an alternative currency was a non-runner.The Estcoin team has hastily dialled down its ambitions, planning to make their currency a kind of loyalty scheme for the businesses in the e-Residency scheme.But it has also helped throw the spotlight on Estonia as a location for successful ICOs.One of them is WePower, which raised $40m for its blockchain-based renewable energy trading platform.The firm's chief technology officer has a more traditional business background than many in the ICO world, having joined from an Estonian energy utility.Kaspar Kaarlep says an ICO was the only option for getting the company off the ground.""Today's capital markets are very difficult,"" he says.""I would even say doing an ICO if you want to do something big in the energy market is the only way to fund it.""He admits that ICOs have a reputation issue but says it is early days, comparing the scene to the late 1990s when all sorts of weird and wonderful dot-coms got funded.The trouble is there is both a startling level of fraud and a high failure rate - a study by a crypto-currency news site found that nearly half of 2017's ICOs had already failed.Regulators are taking a closer interest in these schemes and potential investors are being warned that there is a good chance they will lose all of their money.So, a couple of months after meeting them at London Blockchain Week we contacted our two featured ICOs to see how they were doing. Both had suffered setbacks.Gov van Ek tells us that Bitcar has only raised $9m of its $25m target.""We're not disappointed with that,"" he insists. ""It's more than enough to get our platform and our vision going.""He accepts that a lot of people are losing faith in the crypto-currency market but - like everyone else I've met on the ICO scene - he is confident his project will be one of the survivors.As for dating-on-the-blockchain Viola, its founder and her team have decided to ""pause"" the sale and are monitoring market conditions to see when will be a good time to restart.Perhaps these and other ICOs will go on to raise lots of money, transforming entire industries.Or maybe magical money will prove to be magical thinking and the ICO bubble will burst, leaving thousands of investors poorer and wiser."
technology	CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum		"A new craze for virtual kittens is slowing down trade in one of the largest crypto-currencies.CryptoKitties lets players buy and breed ""crypto-pets"" on Ethereum's underlying blockchain network.The game's developers told the Bloomberg news agency that CryptoKitties was a ""key step"" to making blockchains more accessible.But its popularity has underscored one of the technology's biggest downsides: its lack of scalability.Etherscan has reported a sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum since the game's release, by the Axiom Zen innovation studio, on 28 November.""CryptoKitties has become so popular that it's taking up a significant amount of available space for transactions on the Ethereum platform,"" said Garrick Hileman, from the University of Cambridge.""Some people are concerned that a frivolous game is now going to be crowding out more serious, significant-seeming business uses.""An estimated $4.5m (£3.35m) has been spent on the cartoon cats at the time of writing, according to Crypto Kitty Sales.What is a CryptoKitty?Think of these rather unpalatable cartoon kittens as unique digital Pokemon cards. The game's developers describe them as ""breedable Beanie Babies"", each with its own unique 256-bit genome.These crypto-collectibles are also gender-fluid, able to play the role of either the ""dame"" or the ""sire"" when bred together. The kitties' unique DNA can lead to four billion possible genetic variations.Some of the varieties created so far look lifelike, with grey striped fur and bulging green eyes. Others are speckled with neon-blue spots or magenta-patterned swirls.How much are CryptoKitties worth?At the time of writing, the median, or mid-range, price of a CryptoKitty is approximately $23.06 (£17.19), according to Crypto Kitty Sales.The game's top cat brought in $117,712.12 (£87,686.11) when it sold on Saturday, 2 December.How can I pay for my own litter?CryptoKitties can be bought using only Ether, a crypto-currency that acts as the fuel of the Ethereum blockchain network.To get started, users must install a Chrome extension called MetaMask, which acts as a digital wallet and lets players send and receive Ether from their computers.Ether must be purchased from a crypto-currency exchange before it can be added to MetaMask.Where do the CryptoKitties come from?Axiom Zen releases a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes, but the rest of the supply is powered by the breeding of existing crypto-pets. Owners of kittens can put them up for sale and set their own price in ethers.Why does it matter if CryptoKitties is slowing down Ethereum?According to ETH Gas Station, the CryptoKitties game accounts for over 10% of network traffic on Ethereum. As traffic increases, transactions become more expensive to execute quickly.""The real big issue is other major players looking for alternatives to Ethereum and moving to different systems,"" Mr Hileman said.""There's definitely an urgency for Ethereum to try and address this issue."""
technology	Tech Tent: Two sides of the crypto-coin	Ad-blocking holePodcast available now:	"Is the whole reputation of the crypto-currency industry under threat as computers are hijacked to mine new coins?On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether a new breed of environmentally conscious blockchain entrepreneurs can demonstrate that this technology does have a sustainable future.This was the week that a lot of people woke up to the fact that their computers could be working away to mine crypto-currencies without their knowledge.Security researcher Scott Helme revealed that a whole host of UK government websites had been infected with crypto-mining software via an accessibility plug-in they all used. That meant visitors could have found their computers were chugging away, making money for the hackers who had planted the software.That was a covert operation.By contrast, the online magazine Salon was upfront about its plans to get some of its readers mining.It informed them this week that if they wanted to use an ad-blocker, the website would have to find an alternative way of earning money from them, by harnessing their ""surplus"" computing power to mine the Monero crypto-currency.There was a bit of an outcry about this - but Salon's publisher Jordan Hoffner told Tech Tent there was a positive, as well as a negative, reaction.""When things are new, it scares people, but it also creates potential opportunities and that's what innovation is all about,"" he said.He pointed out that Salon needed to plug a big hole in its finances caused by the growth of ad-blocking. Just this week, Google released a new version of its Chrome browser with an ad-blocker built in.Hoffner says readers have a choice: if they don't like the idea of handing over their computers to mine Monero, they can either accept a few adverts or pay a subscription to access Salon via a new app.He admits he has no idea how much the company will earn from mining - and of course if the crypto-currency bubble bursts, this idea may turn out to be another blind alley for the publishing industry.But Salon wants to dip its toe into the crypto-currency and blockchain waters and find out whether this technology is as revolutionary as its backers claim.If you want to find somewhere determined to embrace this vision of the future, head for Estonia.This tiny country is punching above its weight when it comes to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), where companies create new currencies to fund blockchain projects. Estonia has more per head than any other nation.Among them is WePower. Its ICO has raised $40m (£28.5m) for its plan to transform the green energy market. The firm's chief technology officer, Kaspar Kaarlep, left Estonia's energy utility to co-found the business.He says WePower has two missions for the tokens it has created through its ICO: to make it simpler to fund new energy projects and eventually to make the link between the consumer and producer closer.""To fund an energy startup is very difficult. Doing an ICO if you want to do something big in energy is the only way to fund it.""The idea is that by recording every energy supplier and every transaction on a blockchain, the consumer will eventually be able to know - and decide - exactly where their energy comes from. ""What blockchain does is allow the connection of the customer to the production - to the actual windmill or the farmer with solar panels.""I put it to Kaspar Kaarlep that so far the only large scale deployment of blockchain had been in Bitcoin where it had proved far from green, consuming vast amounts of energy in the mining process. ""Yes, that's a very good point,"" he said.""Blockchain, as we know it today in its technological youth, will need to improve.""He said it could be 10 years before WePower could fully realise its ambitions. There is a vast amount of hype around blockchain - in the past week I have been told it can do everything from democratising football to guaranteeing the quality of academic research.In Estonia it was good to find a more sober - if still optimistic - assessment of its potential."
technology	CES 2018: Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin mining plans	Coin creationKodak currency	"Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin.The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO).It is part of a blockchain-based initiative to help photographers control their image rights.Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York.Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity.Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity.""This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up,"" commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge.""When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market.""Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, but decided not to commercialise the technology at the time, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage is thought by some to have contributed to it filing for bankruptcy protection years later in 2012.Since that collapse, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras.The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights.More from CES:Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions.Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business.Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock.But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday.The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home.At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC.But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added.""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" he said.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity.But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered.""Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble,"" he said.""It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive.""Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to.Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission.The company said it would then ""manage the licensing process,"" so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin.""Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists,"" said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke.""These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.""The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher.But one expert had doubts.""Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does,"" commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain.""Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that.""This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't.""Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO.""I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services,"" commented Mr Hileman.""It's something many big companies are thinking very hard about.""Follow the BBC team at CES via this Twitter list"
technology	Delays hit KodakCoin crypto-currency plans		"Eastman Kodak shares have fallen after it emerged the company is delaying the launch of its new crypto-currency.KodakCoin is designed to help photographers register, license and manage their images.The initial coin (ICO) offering was announced at the CES technology trade fair and, according to Kodak, has attracted 40,000 potential investors.Initially it said investors could start buying on 31 January, but now it says the process will ""take several weeks"".A statement on Kodak's website blamed the delay on the need to verify each investor.""With over 40,000 potential investors expressing an interest in the ICO, we are now moving into the 'accredited investor' phase,"" it said.It also warned potential investors to be on the lookout for fraudulent websites purporting to sell KodakCoin tokens.It reminded those wishing to buy to do so on the official website and Facebook page.There has been mounting criticism that companies are taking advantage of the current trend to invest in crypto-currencies and the underlying platform, blockchain.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said that it was looking closely at the trend of public companies that had announced investments in blockchain.Kodak's interest in crypto-currency has raised eyebrows among those that follow the 130-year-old photography company, with some calling it a cynical attempt to revive its fortunes.Shares in the company soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to enter the crypto-currency arena. But news of the delay of the ICO saw shares fall more than 15%."
technology	Hackers steal $400,000 of crypto-currency	What are crypto-currencies?	"Hackers have stolen $400,000 (£290,000) of the virtual currency Stellar Lumen in an online attack on Saturday.The group hijacked the server that hosts BlackWallet, a web-based wallet application that stores lumens and stole 669,920 from users' accountsStellar Lumen is thought to be the eighth most popular virtual currency in the world.According to tech news site Bleeping Computer, BlackWallet tried to warn users about the attack via forums.However, many continued to log in and lose money.The hackers have moved the money to Bittrex, a virtual currency exchange, where they are likely to convert it into another digital currency to hide their tracks, Bleeping computer reported.In a post on social website Reddit, BlackWallet's creator said he had since disabled his hosting account and websites.The developer, who goes by the alias of Orbit84, said: ""I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back.""I am in talks with my hosting provider to get as much information about the hacker and will see what can be done with it.""If you ever entered your key on BlackWallet, you may want to move your funds to a new wallet.""A crypto or virtual currency is a type of money that is completely digital. You can use currencies such as Bitcoin to buy products and services, but not many shops accept them yet. In many countries they are heavily regulated.Owners typically keep their currency in digital wallets and can transfer payments to other wallets fairly anonymously, without a bank or broker being involved.Transactions are recorded in a public list called a blockchain - a type of ledger which both records and verifies who spent or transferred which coins. The blockchain exists on computers that solve cryptographic problems as they log transactions to help combat fraud.Stellar is an open-source payments network focused on reducing poverty in the developing world. It says its lumens - which work using blockchain technology - make monetary transactions cheaper, quicker and more reliable.According to CoinMarketCap, a site that ranks the value of different crypto-currencies, there is $11.6bn worth of Stellar Lumen in circulation.That is far less than the top virtual currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are thought to be worth $240.3bn and $127.4bn respectively.In 2016, the price of bitcoin fell more than 10% after the Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said it had suffered a major hack.The security breach led to the possible theft of bitcoin worth $65m (£49m).And in 2017 hackers targeted the Bithumb exchange in South Korea, taking millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum.The personal information of 30,000 people was also stolen in the attack, which was credited to North Korea."
technology	Bitcoin swings as civil war looms	What's at stake?In simple terms, why does this problem exist?So, why not just raise the limit?What is the rival plan?Is compromise possible?	"The value of the virtual currency Bitcoin has always been volatile.Even so, there has been particular turbulence in recent days as fears of a ""civil war"" among its adherents first grew and then subsided, although they have not gone away altogether.On Sunday, the value of one bitcoin dropped to about $1,863 (£1,430) before bouncing back to $2,402 on Wednesday, according to data from the news site CoinDesk - still some way off a June high of $3,019.Bitcoin risks becoming a victim of its success.The popularity of the financial technology has caused transactions to be processed slower, with some users complaining of having to wait three days or more for confirmation of trades when the backlog was at its worst, in May.Moreover, fees have also risen, hitting a high of $5 per transaction at the start of June.That makes it too costly to justify its use for some purchases, such as buying a pint of lager in a Bitcoin-accepting pub.There are ways around the problem, but the cryptocurrency's community has been split over which solution to adopt.The risk is that Bitcoin could effectively split in two, with one type becoming incompatible with another, ultimately undermining confidence in the project altogether.The issue is that Bitcoin's underlying technology has an in-built constraint: the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only 1MB of data added to it every 10 minutes.To understand why, it's helpful to first understand how Bitcoin works.To authenticate Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" takes place, which involves volunteers' computers racing to solve difficult mathematical problems.For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. As a reward, the successful miners are given newly generated bitcoins.An updated copy of the blockchain database is then copied to all the computers involved in the validation process, which are referred to as ""nodes"".Bitcoin originally did not have the 1MB/10min blockchain limit, but the feature was added to help defend the technology against denial of service (DoS) attacks, which might overwhelm the blockchain by flooding it with tiny transactions.Mining, by the way, has become a big business in its own right, with some companies investing in huge ""farms"" of computers dedicated to the activity. Several of the biggest are based in China.Many of the miners have, in fact, favoured the so-called Bitcoin Unlimited solution.They said that allowing them to increase the 1MB block size would speed up transactions and reduce transactions fees.But this could also make mining more expensive, and impractical for small ""mom and pop"" operations, leaving it under the control of a handful of large corporations.That is because more processing power would be needed to verify transactions.Furthermore, additional data bandwidth and storage space would be needed to transmit and store the blockchain, since it would become much bigger.Critics also say the move would make Bitcoin more vulnerable to hackers.Moreover, some people are concerned that giving the miners power to vary the block size might undermine the principle of Bitcoin being decentralised, with no equivalent to a central bank running the show.Some software developers have favoured reorganising the format of Bitcoin transactions to make the blockchain more efficient.Specifically, they propose relocating "" transaction signatures"" - which unlock bitcoins so they can be spent - from within the blockchain to a separate file transmitted alongside it.Doing so should make it possible to process transactions at double the current rate.And as an added benefit, ""node"" computers could save on storage space by opting not to keep records of the oldest signatures.This scheme is known as Segregated Witness, or Segwit.However, critics say it would deliver only a temporary respite while adding an extra level of complexity.It appears so.A middle-ground solution - called Segwit2x - aims to start sending signature data separately from the blockchain later this week and then to double the block size limit to 2MB in three months' time.An initiative called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) states that if 80% of the mining effort adopts the new blockchain software involved and uses it consistently between 21 July and 31 July, then the wider community should accept this as the solution.The good news for those who like the idea is that close to 90% of miners appear to back the effort, according to Coin Dance, a Bitcoin-related statistics site.Other plans exist to try again after August if the target is missed.But a risk remains that if use of Segwit2x software never reaches the required threshold or that hardcore opponents refuse to buckle, then it could result in two different versions of the blockchain, and in effect two types of Bitcoin.Such as schism could help rival cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, prosper and ultimately doom Bitcoin altogether.One expert, however, said he believed that was an unlikely outcome.""The vast majority of people in the Bitcoin community are opposed to splitting Bitcoin into two competing cryptocurrencies,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.""Such a move would weaken Bitcoin's network effect advantage and sow confusion.""It is much more likely that people who are dissatisfied with Bitcoin's direction will simply move on to something else, which is what we've seen in the past.""""More and more small to medium sized companies who are 'mining' at the moment will be taken out of the game if they won't adapt and grow,"" said Martin Sims, CEO of Coin Geek.""It's a very competitive industry and everyone needs to update and evolve as the popularity of bitcoin increases and the game changes."""
technology	Accenture and Microsoft plan digital IDs for millions of refugees	How it worksWhat is blockchain?	"Technology companies develop system to help the United Nations provide digital legal identification for refugees who have no official documents.Accenture and Microsoft have designed a digital ID network running on blockchain technology.The prototype connects existing public and commercial records so people can access their personal details from any location.The UN wants everyone on the planet to have legal identities by 2030.There are currently 1.1 billion people around the world with no official documentation, including people who have been displaced from their original homes.The UN's latest report estimates that there are about 22.5 million refugees. There are no figures for how many of these are undocumented, but it is likely many are.The digital ID network was unveiled at the ID2020 summit in New York on Monday. ID2020 is an alliance of governments, public sector organisations and technology companies working together to help the UN realise its goal.The system, which builds on Accenture's existing biometrics identity management platform, will be tested with aid agencies in the near future.Often when people arrive at a refugee camp for the first time, they don't have anything to prove their identity, which is essential for a range of health, financial and education services.Usually, several aid agencies at once will be trying to work with the same refugees, and, until now, there has not been a way for them to share data securely.In the future, when a refugee arrives at a camp, their face, irises and fingerprints could be scanned and the resulting biometric data stored, with their name, on one of the aid agency's servers.The blockchain digital ID network then creates a ""stamp"" - a unique identifier between the refugee and the data on the servers - that proves they have been authenticated for each service they receive.If they receive healthcare services in the camp, such as a vaccine, then they receive a stamp.If another agency confirms their education and birth, these become other stamps.Eventually, they will have an album of stamps they can show to any provider or government to prove their identity digitally, without needing to worry about data going missing from various providers.The blockchain is a method of recording data - a digital ledger of transactions, agreements, contracts, anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified as having happened.The big difference is that this ledger isn't stored in one place, it's distributed across several hundreds or even thousands of computers around the world. No one person or entity can control the data, which makes it transparent.The data forms blocks that are encrypted into a continuous chain using complex mathematical algorithms. Once updated, the ledger cannot be altered or tampered with, only added to, and it is updated for everyone in the network at the same time.""For someone who has nothing, who is starting over, this is a means by which they can start over and not lose their identity again. It's a much richer set of identity information than we have today,"" David Treat, a managing director in Accenture's financial services practice, told the BBC News website.But the technology would be very useful for the rest of society, as there was always the fear that we could lose our identity data too, he said.""We all have challenges with identity because it is fragmented and it is owned by the authorities and not by us. If you count the number of logins you have, there are a lot, and you don't own a lot of your information, someone else does. This is the basis by which identity can be stolen or corrupted,"" said Mr Treat.""The ability for us to control our own data opens up the possibility for us to decide who we want to get marketing from, and whether we want to share the accurate data for them to do so."""
technology	Tech Tent: Will crypto-crime end the Bitcoin bubble?	Also on the podcast this week:	"On Friday, Japanese regulators staged a raid on the offices of Coincheck, a crypto-currency exchange that has been hit by what could be the biggest bank heist in history.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether a crime wave hitting the crypto-currency industry is sapping confidence in the whole project.The Japanese regulators wanted to know just what kind of security measures were in place when hackers stole $530m (£375m) worth of crypto-currencies from Coincheck.On Tuesday, America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received a court order to close down an initial coin offering (ICO), which encourage people to buy into new crypto-currencies before they launch, which was aiming to raise $1bn. The SEC said the plan to create a new currency to fund what was called a decentralised bank was a scam.And this week, the cyber-security firm Digital Shadows produced a report on the latest fashion in cyber-crime: profiting from the crypto-currency boom.The report - titled The New Gold Rush - details the various types of scam, from fake ICOs to raids on exchanges to simple phishing attacks. Its author, Becky Pinkard, tells Tech Tent that cyber-criminals have decided to jump on the bandwagon as the frenzy of popular excitement about the rise in value of Bitcoin has grown.""We have people all the way down to my grandmother asking about Bitcoin and what it means and whether I can make money from it,"" she says.""What that does is then create the type of exposure that criminals need in order to come in and take advantage of folks who don't really know what they're doing.""Digital Shadows has been scouring criminal forums on the dark web and has found plenty of conversations about ICOs - and how to profit from them.""Just set it up, people will come and they will drop the money on you,"" said one comment.The mood about ICOs and other manifestations of the crypto-currency boom certainly seems to have shifted this week. Facebook has announced that it is to ban all adverts promoting any kind of crypto-currency product.Meanwhile there has been a sudden slew of prominent thinkers casting doubt on everything from the value of Bitcoin to the significance of the blockchain technology underpinning it.The boss of MIT's Media Lab, Joi Ito, wrote a piece headlined The Big ICO Swindle. The respected economist Nouriel Roubini weighed in with Blockchain's Broken Promises, casting doubt on a technology that proponents claim has great potential, whatever happens to Bitcoin.Such downbeat assessments, combined with growing regulatory pressure, seem to be having an effect. Bitcoin and other so-called altcoins have taken another sharp lurch downwards in recent days,. The crypto-bandwagon may not have halted but at least one of the wheels looks like it is coming off."
technology	Bill Gates says crypto-currencies cause deaths	Charitable donations	"Crypto-currencies are killing people in a ""fairly direct way"", Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said.He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl.In an ""ask me anything"" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering.Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology.Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: ""The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.""Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto-currencies is super risky for those who go long.""Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze ""will come to a bad end"".Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interview on Bloomberg TV, he said that Bitcoin ""was better than currency"".His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper.In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were ""reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio"".Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects.The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya.Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity.The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens.While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering.The UK's Treasury Committee is currently investigating the impact of such currencies."
technology	Marshall Islands warned against adopting digital currency		"The Republic of the Marshall Islands has been warned against adopting a digital currency as a second form of legal tender.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the country, which consists of hundreds of islands in the Pacific Ocean, should ""seriously reconsider"".Currently, only the US dollar counts as legal tender in the islands.A law to adopt a digital currency named ""Sovereign"" alongside the dollar was passed in February.The first virtual coins are due to be issued to members of the public via an initial coin offering (ICO) later this year.However, IMF directors said the potential benefits of the move were much smaller than the potential costs of ""economic, reputational and governance risks"".""[Marshall Island] authorities should seriously reconsider the issuance of the digital currency as legal tender,"" wrote the directors in their report, which was first spotted by cryptocurrency news site Coindesk.There is just one domestic commercial bank in the country and it is at risk of losing its only correspondent banking relationship with another bank in the US.That relationship allows the Islands to transfer dollars in and out of the country.It highlighted the Marshall Islands' dependence on foreign aid, and the fact that the country is vulnerable to natural disasters as well as sea level rise linked to climate change.Adopting a digital currency as an official form of legal tender would threaten both financial integrity and the nation's key relationship with the US bank. The result could be disruption to foreign aid, according to the IMF.The global financial organisation was expressing concern because it was aware of traditional banks' wariness around digital currencies, said David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 foot Blockchain.Those banks may, for example, associate crypto or digital currencies with criminal activity, including money-laundering, because the digital currency networks have been designed to move coins or tokens around at great speed.""You just can't control the stuff,"" Mr Gerard told the BBC. ""Tokens are really, really liquid, that's the whole point.""This could give the US correspondent bank cause to rethink its relationship with the Marshall Islands, he explained.""The IMF is not strong-arming the Marshalls, what they're doing is describing what will obviously happen if they proceed - the large correspondent bank will be quite worried,"" he added."
technology	Tech Tent: What a year for Bitcoin		"Rejoice everyone, it is that time of the year again. This week's edition of Tech Tent is our annual festive quiz - and although I am writing this before taking part on one of the teams, I suspect that Bitcoin will feature among the questions.What a year it has been for the crypto-currency, which started 2017 worth less than $1,000 and by last weekend had climbed to within a few dollars of the $20,000 mark. For all of that period, sceptics have been predicting that the bubble would burst and in the past 24 hours it has seemed at times that this was happening.The price, which has been sinking all week, fell more than 10% in a matter of hours, dipping towards $13,000 before staging a partial recovery. Though as someone commented, it is moving so fast, any Bitcoin article is out of date five minutes after it is written.What is worrying is that we are at the stage in a bubble where people have been rushing in without much thought and with little understanding either of how Bitcoin works or the risks involved.Earlier this week while filming a report for the BBC News at Ten, we visited a Bitcoin cash machine in a cafe at a London Tube station. I'd been here before when it appeared to be scarcely used but this time a steady stream of people - mostly young men - arrived to stick £20 notes in the machine and get a tiny fraction of a Bitcoin in exchange.Most did not want to speak but one told me he had got about £10,000 invested in various crypto-currencies. When I asked what he would do if the bubble did burst, he insisted: ""I'll hold it. I have faith that it will go back up. Even if it collapses, I'm going to hold it.""Over on Reddit on Friday, there was a sudden dawning of awareness that markets can go down as well as up: ""Argued with my wife for months to buy,"" wrote one man. ""Finally get approval to buy $1,000 at $19,400."" This was followed by an expletive.These wild swings in Bitcoin's value are making it ever more evident that it is not really a currency - there are very few places that accept it and why would you spend it if you thought it would be worth more tomorrow? At our BBC editorial meeting, there was a discussion about whether we should continue to use the term ""crypto-currency"" when Bitcoin so clearly does not operate as a means of exchange - though we decided commodity or speculative asset did not quite do the job.It does now feel that something has got to give as the frenzy spreads from Bitcoin to other ""currencies"" and to the blockchain technology that underpins them. This week the drinks company Long Island Iced Tea saw its shares soar by more than 400% after it changed its name to Long Island Blockchain - proof, surely, that the crypto-craziness is now reaching terminal velocity.That is certainly the view of David Gerard, whose book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain is a very convincing takedown of the whole phenomenon. He is worried about the people who have got caught up late in the day: ""This is how economic bubbles work - people buy because other people are buying and they assume they can sell and get rich. When the bubble pops - and it's when not if - it's going to be a disaster for a lot of people.""One worry is that when people do try to rush for the exit they find it blocked. I have been selling some of the Bitcoin I bought 18 months ago, paying about £60.In theory that is simple enough and indeed I have sold £500 worth for a small fee. But actually getting that cash into my sterling bank account is far from seamless - so far I am a week in to what promises to be a two-week process.Hardly the frictionless finance that was promised by Bitcoin's advocates and if the rush to sell gathers pace there is a good chance that the system seizes up completely.Let me end by wishing all Tech Tent listeners a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I expect the crypto-craze and the blockchain bubble will continue to provide us with stories throughout 2018."

The government closed one of its services - UberPop - in 2015 and the firm temporarily shut down its Paris service in 2016 in protest against tough new regulations.President Macron met with technology firms earlier this week at the Elysee Palace in Paris to discuss how they are dealing with issues such as data protection and fake news.On the back of the meeting, a series of investments have been announced, including:"
technology	Bitcoin soars to record high value	Bitcoin fork	"Bitcoin's value has jumped to a record high, following a month of turmoil.The virtual currency reached $3,451.86 (£2,651) per coin in Monday trade, according to the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index.It had never crossed the $3,000 mark until the weekend. The market value of all bitcoins in existence has now surpassed $56bn (£43bn).The surge followed the creation of a spin-off crypto-currency, Bitcoin Cash, last week.The new asset is trading well below the peak price of $727.54 (£557) per coin it attained on 2 August.However, Bitcoin Cash's future does appear to be more assured after Coinbase, one of the leading exchange and wallet services, promised to support it after previously refusing to give such a commitment.""We are planning to have support for Bitcoin Cash by 1 January 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time,"" it announced on its blog.The value of the original Bitcoin experienced big swings in July. First there was concern that there might be a ""civil war"" over rival plans to speed up transactions.That helped cause its value to dip to $1,938.94 (£1,485) on 16 July before a compromise scheme called Segwit2x gained favour.Then a fresh plan to fork the currency emerged from a group of insiders unhappy with the Segwit2x initiative.On 1 August, they offered investors a Bitcoin Cash token to match every original Bitcoin token they owned. The move created an incompatible version of the blockchain ledger, which keeps track of past transactions.The initiative had the potential to undermine the original Bitcoin, particularly if many miners had jumped ship. Miners provide the computer processing power to authorise transactions, and Bitcoin Cash was designed to appeal to their interests.However, it currently remains more profitable to mine the original Bitcoin's blockchain than that of Bitcoin Cash, and support for the new crypto-currency remains limited.""What this has shown is that Bitcoin is much more resilient to forks than some people thought,"" commented Michael Parsons, a blockchain adviser.""And it appears that there is room for more than one type of Bitcoin to exist.""Another market watcher suggested that the introduction of Bitcoin Cash had actually contributed to the surge in the original version's value.""We've seen a lot of people selling their Bitcoin Cash in order to buy more Bitcoin,"" said Matthew Newton, market analyst at the eToro trading platform.""On top of this, some investors sat on the sidelines last week, waiting to see what happened, these investors are now moving back into Bitcoin.""The total market capitalisation for all crypto-currencies - including Ethereum and Litecoin - was close to $118bn on Monday at 14:40 BST, according to CoinMarketCap."
technology	Tech Tent: The crypto-currency craze		"In the late 1990s, as investors woke up to the promise of the internet, shares in any company with dot.com after its name soared to giddy heights.Then the bubble burst.Now there are warnings of another technology investment bubble - this time related to the fascination with crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we examine the phenomenon of ICOs - Initial Coin Offerings - which have seen over $1bn raised so far this year from investors who get little more than a token and a vague promise of involvement in a new business.The term ICO - designed to mirror the IPO that sees a firm issue shares and float on a stock exchange - seems to mean different things to different people. Early versions were simply ways of getting a new crypto-currency off the ground, but now many are promising to use the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin and similar currencies to create businesses.Among the ICO projects listed by Smith + Crown, which researches the crypto-currency scene, is a business raising money to create the world's most lucrative lottery based on blockchain, and another that promises to rent out high-quality office space using digital tokens.On Tech Tent, we talk to an entrepreneur who is boldly going into uncharted territory with this new investment technique. Pavlo Tanasyuk is the founder of Spacebit, which aims to create what he calls ""a distributed space agency unshackled by state or national sponsorship"".Next month, he will invite investors to take a stake in this venture, which he describes as a crypto version of Elon Musk's Space X. He will only accept payment in Bitcoin, Ethereum or other crypto-currencies and in return backers will get tokens and a role in deciding how the business is run.But the finance blogger Frances Coppola has compared ICOs to the tulip fever of the 16th Century and other investment bubbles.""The enthusiasm for ICOs is coming off the back of the Bitcoin and Ethereum booms,"" she says.She warns that such schemes are completely unregulated, and fears that many who invest in them simply won't understand what they're getting into.""There will be scams in this - I'd be astonished if regulators aren't looking at this.""Even Pavlo Tanasyuk concedes there is plenty of risk attached to this kind of investment. ""Ninety-five per cent won't deliver - but we will. It's important to set an example. We're doing something real and have a strong management team in place.""When the dot com bubble burst, it became clear that many investors had not really understood what the firms they were backing actually did or the nature of the technological challenges they faced. Today, the world of crypto-currencies and the blockchain looks even more impenetrable.Consider this description of one project, Neverdie, which has already raised more than $2m (£1.5m) in an ICO: ""A virtual reality infrastructure platform that bridges virtual worlds with popular MMORPGs [massively multiplayer online role-playing games] on the Ethereum blockchain.""Doubtless those who have bought the coins that are meant to fund this vision have read the white paper describing the project, and the disclaimer at the end: ""Neverdie Coins and Teleport Tokens do not represent ownership in any real-world companies. These tokens are designed to activate virtual utilities.""Real money is going into a virtual world and if it disappears in a puff of virtual smoke, no regulator will be there to cry foul. Let's hope those who back these kind of ventures are going into them with their eyes open."
technology	Bitcoin splits as new currency takes off	Bigger blocksPure speculation?	"A new version of Bitcoin has been mined for the first time in the crypto-currency's history.Bitcoin Cash is the result of months of debate and development over how the currency would continue to evolve.Fears of large swings in the value of Bitcoin have so far not been realised - but some exchanges are still adapting to the new currency.One expert said the process had gone smoothly so far and pointed out that trade in Bitcoin Cash seemed ""robust"".Bitcoin Cash was developed as a measure to increase the capacity of Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain - a digital ledger that records every single transaction.Because the old blockchain could only have one megabyte (MB) of data added to it every 10 minutes, transactions have come to be processed at slower rates.Bitcoin Cash blocks can be as large as 8MB, which its proponents hope will help to solve this problem.Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash was officially born when block number 478559 - at just under 2MB in size - was mined.No major issues have so far been detected following the split although a few exchanges and wallets have had minor technical issues with supporting Bitcoin Cash initially, said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.""A market seems to be emerging for Bitcoin Cash that looks to be relatively robust,"" he told the BBC.The fresh-faced crypto-currency was trading comfortably above $400 (£300) about 12 hours after it was created.Bitcoin itself saw a modest fall in price on Tuesday, but was still above $2,700 (£2,000) at 10:00 BST on Wednesday.Thanks to its larger block size, Bitcoin Cash requires more computer storage space from parties wishing to take part in the process of mining.Mining involves computers being tasked with solving difficult mathematical problems in order to authorise transactions on the blockchain.Miners receive new bitcoins as a reward for this work - making it lucrative - and it has also been something open to individuals in the past, because the cost of small scale mining equipment has been relatively low.That could change thanks to Bitcoin Cash.""Bigger players with access to server farms and big budgets will have no problem running bigger nodes, but smaller operators could be squeezed out,"" said Dr Hileman.""Will companies dominate Bitcoin Cash more than Bitcoin? We're going to see this in the flesh now, how this will play out.""And there are other issues to ponder - not least the decision by one of the biggest crypto-currency exchanges, Coinbase, not to support Bitcoin Cash.""Seriously look at Bitcoin Cash going up. If you kept your [Bitcoin] at @coinbase and are not getting any you must be pretty fed up right now,"" tweeted one trader who watched the split unfold.The split might also make it harder to establish Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash as currencies useful for commerce, suggested Vili Lehdonvirta at the Oxford Internet Institute.This is because a greater number of currencies each with a smaller number of users are less likely to be accepted in lots of different places, he explained.But Bitcoin traders may simply be interested in speculation - buying and selling coins in the hope they rise in value.""In which case actual usefulness doesn't matter,"" he said."
technology	Does Bitcoin still matter?	Bitcoin vs blockchainWhat is blockchain?Bitcoin problemsMore blockchainsCould Bitcoin be a viable currency?	"Craig Wright's assertion that he was the creator of Bitcoin this week occurred at the same time as thousands of members of a growing industry tied to the virtual currency attended the Consensus 2016 conference in New York.Attendees debated the truth of Wright's claims, but also grappled with the more poignant question of whether Bitcoin still matters?Bitcoin has come a long way since its start. What was once marketed as a global currency - free from government restrictions - is now seen as a burgeoning technology that can help improve the world's financial system and change how information and assets are stored and shared.Hundreds of new companies have started that focus on creating blockchains, the underlying ledger system on which Bitcoin is based.The answer to Bitcoin's relevance depends on whether you are talking about the digital currency or the industry.Because Bitcoin was the first digital currency, the sector as a whole is often referred to as the Bitcoin industry.It now prefers to be called blockchain - after the technology which underpins Bitcoin.The currency is struggling because of strains on its technology and persistent doubts about when and if it can become a mainstream form of money.The blockchain industry however is thriving as new uses for the technology continue to be dreamed up and investors continue to fund them.""Digital currency is now a misnomer for Bitcoin,"" says Erik Voorhees, chief executive officer for Shape Shift, a digital currency exchange. ""It can be used as currency, but it can be used for many things.""Blockchains rely on cryptography to allow a set of computers to make changes to a global record without needing a central actor.Removing the middleman cuts costs in almost every sector.The blockchain is a ledger that records everything that happens to a collection of data known as a ""block"" in a chronological order or ""chain"".As a currency this is an important feature because it allows users to be sure their digital money is one of a kind, the same way each note in your wallet is unique.""Blockchain tech will be the way we create assets because it allows you to transfer digital information without copying,"" says Adam Ludwin, chief executive of Chain.com, which builds blockchain networks.Blockchain can be used to track the history of all sorts of information and maintain its value, so, for example, doctors could use it to update medical records.Since each change to a blockchain is made simultaneously across the whole network, no information is lost and because changes cannot be undone the system maintains its transparency. A special key is needed to make changes to each block, so individuals can keep their records safe by protecting that key.The original code for Bitcoin was designed to produce a fixed amount. Its popularity has meant the digital currency is coming to its limit faster than many expected.Among Bitcoin's core engineers there is a division about how to fix this problem.One group advocates doubling the size of the ""blocks"" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term. Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones.For companies that are thinking of using blockchain tech or digital currency, this schism makes it hard to choose Bitcoin.""This is sending signals that are making engineers worried,"" says Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers. ""People are waiting to see what happens before launching.""Almost since Bitcoin's creation there have been copycats. As more industries warmed to the idea of blockchain these imitators began to look less like virtual currencies and more like digital record keepers.Some of these are public - allowing anyone to join and grow the chain - while others are private to ensure only trusted parties have access, an approach favoured by banks.This explosions of new blockchains has created a need for inter-ledger operators. These companies allow people to exchange digital assets from one blockchain to another.""Blockchain is another database and it's impractical to think of the world working on one database,"" says Chris Larsen, the chief executive of global financial settlement company Ripple.For believers in a government-free digital currency, Bitcoin is the still the biggest player.Virtual currencies could still have a place in finance, particularly in countries with less stable governments and economies. Governments though have been looking for ways to add regulation, in an effort to prevent tax dodging, money laundering and other criminal activities that were associated with the early Bitcoin days.Eventually blockchains could allow users to exchange the rights to all sorts of assets, like houses or stocks, update records and make payments without relying on a third party to verify the transaction.But for this to become a reality more users will have to join blockchains."
technology	Bitcoin rebels risk 'currency trading chaos'	Compromise planNew coins for oldPotential chaos	"A split in the Bitcoin community is set to create a new incompatible version of the cryptocurrency on Tuesday.A group of insiders is unhappy with existing plans to speed up transaction times.They plan to offer existing investors a matching amount of a new virtual asset - called Bitcoin Cash - which could put pressure on the value of original bitcoins.One expert has warned there could be trading ""chaos"" over the coming days.Several popular Bitcoin platforms are refusing to support the new coins.That means investors who currently rely on some Bitcoin currency exchanges and virtual wallets will be unable to take advantage of the offer unless they switch to alternative providers. And moving from one platform to another carries risks of its own.""Nobody can be sure how this is going to play out over the short term,"" commented Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director of the eToro trading platform.The breakaway plan was revealed just over a week ago after it emerged that a compromise scheme to reform Bitcoin appeared to have gathered enough support to be adopted.The middle-ground solution - known as Segwit2x - is an attempt to address one of Bitcoin's constraints: at present the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only one megabyte of data added to it every 10 minutes.The limitation was originally introduce to protect Bitcoin from cyber-attacks, but has meant some users have had to wait days for their transactions to complete at busy times.Two conflicting solutions were initially proposed:Many ""miners"" - dedicated businesses and others that contribute computer processing power to authorise transactions in return for the chance of being awarded newly minted Bitcoins - favoured the former plan.But many developers - those working on Bitcoin's code or that of associated software - preferred the latter.The Segwit2x initiative solved the impasse by suggesting the data-splitting step should occur in August and then be followed by an increase in the block size to 2MB in November.Under the terms of a related scheme - referred to as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) - the first step would only happen if 80% of the mining effort adopted the new blockchain software required and used it consistently between 21 July and 31 July.After more than 95% of miners signalled their support for the plan it was widely assumed that a Bitcoin ""civil war"" had been averted.But then ex-Facebook engineer Amaury Sechet and other Bitcoin insiders revealed plans to launch Bitcoin Cash on 1 August at 12:20 UTC (13:20 BST).They claimed that the danger with the Segwit2x scheme was that there was no guarantee a doubling of the block size would follow the data-splitting step, as promised.Instead their new currency would have a block size of 8MB and ditch the data-dividing idea.To further complicate matters, some Bitcoin exchanges are divided about whether to support the creation of Bitcoin Cash and allow its trade, with several yet to declare their plans.Furthermore, some exchanges plan to suspend or restrict trade in Bitcoin altogether for several days until they are confident that any disruption has passed.The uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin Cash's chances has led to one futures market in Bitcoin Cash to value one coin as being worth about $267, a fraction of the $2,780 each bitcoin was trading at short time ago.In theory, if mass adoption were expected, the two currencies should be much closer in price.""There's massive uncertainty and the quoted futures price should be taken with a grain of salt,"" commented Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.""We won't know the real Bitcoin Cash price until a number of exchanges across the world start trading it, and it's still not clear when that will happen.""And he added that there could be some wild swings in the value of both types of Bitcoin over the coming days.""My sense is that the split can be managed if exchanges and wallets take the necessary precautions,"" he explained.""But I suspect some will not be well prepared as this happened quickly and a lot of organisations are coming on board at the last minute.""It wouldn't surprise me if there is some chaos."""
technology	Bitcoin could help cut power bills	Smart contract	"The technology behind the Bitcoin virtual currency could help cut electricity bills, suggests research.A blockchain-based smart plug that can adjust power consumption minute-by-minute has been created by technologists at Accenture.The blockchain is the automated ledger that underpins Bitcoin and tracks where the coins are spent and swapped.The plug shops for different power suppliers and will sign up for a cheaper tariff if it finds one.Accenture said the smart plug could help people on low incomes who pay directly for power.The smart plug modifies the basic Bitcoin blockchain technology to make it more active, said Emmanuel Viale, head of the Accenture team at the firm's French research lab that worked on the plug.Instead of just resolving and confirming transaction records, the Accenture work has changed the blockchain to let it negotiate deals on behalf of its owner.""It's about how we put more business behaviour or logic into the blockchain,"" said Mr Viale, adding that this essentially embeds a ""smart contract"" into the digital ledger.The smart plug prototype works with other gadgets in the house that monitor power use. When demand is high or low it searches for energy prices and then uses the modified blockchain to switch suppliers if it finds a cheaper source.So far, said Mr Viale, the Accenture system was just a proof of concept, but it could help many people on lower incomes who pay for their power via a meter.Being able to quickly shift suppliers could save this group more than £660m in the UK annually, suggests Accenture research.A blockchain-based system that can act on behalf of its owner might also prove useful as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous, said Mr Viale.Managing many different gadgets might be tricky without a more centralised system, he said,Martin Garner, a mobile services expert at analyst firm CCS Insight, said blockchains were starting to crop up in many different areas including share trading, fishing rights databases and land registry claims.They had two chief attractions for the Internet of Things, he said.""They avoid dependence on any one supplier or ecosystem - some users have concerns about the potential dominance of key internet players creating, for example, the Google-of-Things or the Amazon-of-Things,"" he said.""The second attraction is as a way of enabling autonomous trading between things, such as the appliances in your house being set up to re-order supplies from a pre-approved list of suppliers,"" he added."
technology	Tech Tent: Social giants get grilled	Senate v Silicon ValleyCan blockchain beat fake news?Clicks and bricks in Somalia	"In the week that the term ""fake news"" was named word of the year by Collins dictionary, the Tech Tent podcast explores how Facebook, Google and Twitter fared when they were grilled by US senators over their role in spreading misinformation.We also find out about an attempt to build a platform for news you can trust and we meet the man who has discovered that clicks have to go with bricks if you offer online shopping in Somalia.This was the week that executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter got first hand experience of how the political mood towards Silicon Valley has changed.Instead of the customary wide-eyed enthusiasm for what their technology can do for America, they found deep distrust about their role in last year's US presidential election.In two days of Senate hearings about how social media may have aided and abetted Russian attempts to sway the election, it was Facebook that was the main target. Senator Al Franken, a comedian before he entered politics, wanted to know why political ads being paid for in roubles ""didn't spell something bad"".On Tech Tent, we explore what new information we learned from those Senate hearings about the Russian social media propaganda effort.One lesson for the social media giants may be to take these hearings more seriously. The companies came under fire from one Senator for sending their lawyers rather than their bosses. Next time, perhaps we will see Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page and Jack Dorsey turn up. Now that would be a hot ticket.Given the growing concern about the spread of misinformation online, it is no wonder there is a search for new platforms to combat the fakery phenomenon. One of them is Wikitribune, the brainchild of Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales. It started testing its crowd-edited and checked news service this week to somewhat mixed reviews.Another start-up wants to use that most fashionable of new ideas - blockchain technology - to act as a guarantor of authenticity. Publiq is planning what it describes as a ""decentralised content platform that offers merit-based and instant remuneration to authors and advertisers in order to combat fake news"".I found that slightly opaque, to say the least, but the chief executive Alexandre Tabbakh explained that it was all about disrupting a business model that rewards clicks at the expense of accuracy and authenticity.His idea is that writers will be rewarded according to their reputation, with their work stored forever on the blockchain as proof of their credentials. Advertisers will then flock to the platform, knowing their messages will be placed next to reputable content, not fake news.It is an intriguing idea. But our special guest, the technology writer Kate Bevan, shared my scepticism. The problem will be convincing journalists to come to Publiq in the first place. They may like the idea of a platform free from fakery, but they will want to be convinced that there is an audience for their work.Now here's a challenge: how do you set up an e-commerce business in a country where less than a third of the population has access to the internet and few people have bank accounts? It does not sound easy.But Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, found a way to get his online shopping business Muraadso off the ground. He quickly realised that he needed to combine an online operation with a real world presence - bricks as well as clicks.""We have our site and a social presence but at the same time we have physical stores that we can deliver from, and also give customers an experience.""He says his customers still want to touch and feel products and there is also an issue of confidence. ""They don't trust pure e-commerce sites.""And as for dealing with payments when few have a bank account, Muraadso offers customers the chance to pay cash on delivery or use a popular mobile payments service.Somalis may not be alone in wanting to mix and match when it comes to online shopping. After all, the giant of the industry Amazon has just bought Whole Foods, a bricks and mortar retail chain.There are also signs that the old-fashioned experience of browsing a bookstore may be making a return, with the UK's biggest book chain Waterstones returning to profit in February after seven years of losses. Perhaps the long predicted death of high street shopping may not be quite so imminent after all."
technology	Google bans crypto-currency adverts	Google certification	"Google has moved to ban crypto-currency advertising from its platforms.The move will affect promotional campaigns for initial coin offerings, Bitcoin exchanges, digital wallets to store the assets and trading advice.A notice said the policy would be introduced in June but did not give an explanation why.The BBC understands that Google decided to act because it felt there was a lack of appropriate consumer protections for highly speculative and complex trades.It follows a similar move by Facebook in January, which said many firms in the sector were acting in bad faith.Google's decision will affect ads displayed both in its search results and YouTube, as well as those placed on third-party sites via its ad platforms.The value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all dipped after the news emerged at about 04:00 GMT.Ahead of the announcement, some users of Google's AdWords service had reported a drop-off in the performance of their crypto-currency campaigns, although the tech giant denied having made any policy changes at that point.Google has also said it will tighten its rules for ads relating to other financial products including spread betting and contracts-for-difference - in which sellers promise to provide compensation for an asset's gain in value over a set period of time, and buyers to cover a loss.It said AdWords users would have to be licensed by the relevant regulators in the countries they are targeting and be certified by Google itself.""This is all a good move,"" commented crypto-currency sceptic David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain.""It's about tackling the kinds of risky investments that verge on gambling.""If you're a proper trader or an accredited investor then fine - it means you're rich and your money is your own problem. But these things shouldn't be targeted at ordinary people.""Google's move followed a warning about crypto-currencies published by the International Monetary Fund's managing director on Tuesday.""Money laundering and terrorist financing is only one dimension of the threat,"" wrote Christine Lagarde.""The rapid growth of crypto-assets, the extreme volatility in their traded prices, and their ill-defined connections to the traditional financial world could easily create new vulnerabilities.""We must welcome their potential but also recognise their risks."""
technology	WannaCry ransomware bitcoins move from online wallets	AnalysisBy Alan Woodward, cyber-security adviser to Europol	"More than $140,000 (£105,000) worth of bitcoins paid by victims of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak have been removed from their online wallets.It has been nearly three months since infections struck organisations worldwide, including the NHS, which faced days of disruption as a result.The bitcoin activity was noticed by a Twitter bot set up by Quartz journalist Keith Collins.The balance of all wallets known to be associated with WannaCry is now zero.The ransomware hit many businesses hard, quickly infecting multiple computers on corporate networks and encrypting them so they became useless.Victims were asked to pay between $300 and $600 to get their systems back.Back in May, many cyber-security experts and law enforcement agencies advised victims that paying the ransom would probably only encourage other cyber-criminals and not result in restored access to computers.However, many clearly decided to take a chance.According to bitcoin-monitoring company Elliptic, an initial portion of the WannaCry funds were moved in late July.And at about 04:10 BST on Thursday, the vast majority were finally withdrawn in entirety.Many watchers expect that the WannaCry bitcoins will be put through a ""mixer"" - in which the currency is transferred and mixed into a larger series of payments that make it much harder to track where it ends up.But the incident has left some cyber-security experts confused.""I have no idea why they would move that money to be honest,"" said Andy Patel at F-Secure.""I wouldn't imagine that they are going to try and turn those bitcoins into real money. If they do, it's going to give someone a way to track them to an actual person.""Instead, Mr Patel told the BBC the funds could be used to pay for dark web services that might leave less of a digital paper trail.In July, bitcoins paid as ransom following a separate attack - NotPetya - were moved from their online wallets.Many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous: the online equivalent of cash. However, every transaction is completely visible to anyone who cares to look.There are even online sites that allow you to view what is happening in the blockchain - the distributed ledger that records all bitcoin movements.The blockchain is more like a Swiss bank account: you know the account number and which account transfers money to which other accounts, but you don't necessarily know who stands behind that account number.A technique called ""cluster analysis"" looks across all of these bitcoin addresses and attempts to find addresses that are being used by the same people.Then, some of the other transactions in that cluster, which were not intended to be anonymous, can provide evidence of who owns those addresses.Law enforcement agencies often use this classic approach to track criminals - the idea, of course, is: ""Follow the money.""Alan Woodward is professor of cyber-security at the University of Surrey.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
technology	Bitcoin Foundation boss urges cautious investment	Small businesses	"The head of the Bitcoin Foundation, Llew Claasen, has urged people to invest ""no more than they can afford"" in the crypto-currency.He was speaking at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania about the potential for Bitcoin in Africa.Billions lack access to formal banking, but the uptake of mobile money means many are willing to embrace alternatives.Bitcoin had been adopted in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, he said.The digital currency had particular resonance in countries with volatile economies, he said.""It offers people a chance to protect their savings from government abuse of monetary policy.""A lot of people in Zimbabwe are interested in it as an alternative financial system, but that is not an easy thing to do formally as we don't want to be perceived as wanting to disrupt economies,"" he told the BBC.The Washington-based Bitcoin Foundation is a non-profit organisation that promotes the use of Bitcoin around the world.Like other crypto-currencies, it relies on a digital technology called the blockchain - a decentralised digital ledger that records every transaction.The tokenisation of crypto-currency - in which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital token on a blockchain - could also have a big impact on Africa, Mr Claasen said.""It means a small business owner can tokenise shares in his business so investors do not have to go through a central intermediary or register their shares.""That would make it easier for investors to both put money in and take it out of businesses, he added.Mr Claasen admitted that, in its current form, Bitcoin was not great as an alternative to cash.But, he said, a forthcoming network upgrade would make low-cost transactions on the mobile network easier.""Currently the network has a transactional input of three to four transactions per second, which isn't great if you want to use it as cash.""But once the upgrade goes live, effectively there will be no limit to the transactions the network can handle.""That upgrade is due in the next six to 12 months.Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high, with the value of one bitcoin soaring to about $4,500 (£3,470).But Mr Claasen sounded a note of caution, urging people not to invest ""more than they can afford"".""To be honest Bitcoin is not a great form of cash right now. Don't think of it as cash, think of it as a digital form of gold that enables you to save outside of the current financial climate,"" he said.He blamed the currency's recent volatility of the currency on ""unsophisticated investors"".""They read an article about it which may or may not be true and make decisions about its long-term future, and that is why we have extreme swings,"" he said.But in a decade's time, he said, everyone would have ""two wallets"", one reflecting local currency and one with a variety of crypto-currencies.He dismissed worries that the currency, because of its anonymous nature, could be used for tax evasion and money-laundering.He pointed to a European Union report this summer that suggested that its potential for criminal activity had been overblown.""It found that there was not a lot of large-scale criminal behaviour,"" he said.""Bitcoin is not completely anonymous and it is fairly easy for someone, say a revenue officer, to work backwards to find who was responsible for a transaction."""
technology	Bitcoin rewards halve for virtual cash money miners	Mining crash	"The financial rewards for being involved with the Bitcoin virtual currency have been halved.Before 9 July, a regular reward of 25 bitcoins was handed out to those who were first to verify which coins had been spent.Now, the leading team of ""miners"" who verify a chunk of global transactions will receive only 12.5 bitcoins.The halving of the reward is scheduled to take place every four years to limit bitcoin inflation.Created in 2008, bitcoins have slowly become accepted as a form of payment by increasing numbers of shops, stores and services.One of the latest to back Bitcoin is cab company Uber, which has started letting passengers in Argentina pay for journeys using a Xapo debit card they can fill with bitcoins.Bitcoin miners are essential to the operation of the virtual currency because they collaborate to maintain the central record of transactions known as the blockchain.Verifying a chunk of transactions, known as a block, involves a complicated mathematical operation, and many miners use dedicated hardware to crank through the possible solutions to the cryptographic puzzle it represents.The mining process is carefully engineered to limit the opportunities for fraud and to ensure coins are handed out on a regular basis.The financial reward for solving the puzzle also helps motivate people to stay involved.The first halving event took place in 2012, when the reward for mining a block dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25.One bitcoin is now worth about £500 ($645), making the reward each time a block is added to the blockchain equal to about £6,244.Many mining pools operating thousands of dedicated computers seeking to be the first to get the solution to the bitcoin puzzle and reap a reward operate on very thin margins.Reuters reports one company, Sweden's KnCMiner, filed for bankruptcy in May, citing the losses it would suffer when the reward halving took place.Competition among miners has increased thanks to the intervention of many Chinese companies, who are now thought to control about two-thirds of the computational power working on Bitcoin's blockchain.Daniel Masters, who runs a bitcoin-based hedge fund, told Reuters: ""It turned out that the Chinese, who really stormed into the mining market in the last couple of years, could just do this whole thing cheaper."""
technology	Tech Tent: The CES 2018 Techie Awards	Best PerformanceBest RobotWorst IdeaBest Snack SelectionGender Diversity AwardThe Courage Award	"This week's Tech Tent is a special edition from Las Vegas with all the news from the greatest gadget show on earth, CES.We meet a rather disturbing humanoid robot called Sophia, we hear about the latest move to rival Tesla with an electric autonomous car, and China's Baidu tells us that a huge smartphone population generating vast amounts of data could give it an edge in the battle for leadership in artificial intelligence.As the show draws to an end, it's time to hand out some awards - let's call them the Techies.The winners have been chosen after an exhaustive process by a jury made up of, well, me.On Monday evening, while sheltering from the driving rain between live broadcasts outside the Bellagio Hotel, we looked up and saw something astounding and beautiful.Dozens of tiny illuminated drones were hovering above the building's famous fountains, flying in formation and weaving patterns in the night sky.We came back the following evening to film the display and talk to Intel's Natalie Cheun, who runs the project, which has put on shows around the world.She showed us one of the Shooting Star drones, which was far less sophisticated than we imagined - no cameras, just really good GPS, which combined with animation software keeps it flying in formation with others in the 250-strong fleet.Now, in a week in which Intel is struggling with negative stories about the security of its chips, cynics would say the drone display is a useful distraction.But it is harder and harder to create a sense of wonder about new technology, so I for one was grateful to be able to look up at the sky and say: ""Wow!""You could hardly move for robots on the show floor this week. Sony's latest version of its robo-dog Aibo was charming everybody.But I'm not convinced I will be trading in my real dog, even though chief executive Kaz Hirai proudly told me Aibo was very smart and connected to the cloud.Kuri was one of a number of companion or entertainment robots demanding entry to our homes.You may like the idea that it wanders around snatching five-second video clips of what the family is up to, or you may want to put a bag over its head and lock it in the cupboard.Too many of our new android friends appear to be confused about their roles in our lives.That is why the award goes to Forpheus, the table tennis robot from Japan's Omron.It knows exactly what it's about - playing ping pong - and it is also kind. After sending your wheezing correspondent racing fruitlessly around the table for a while, it eased up and even started making a few unforced errors.This was a fiercely contested category, given how many dodgy gadgets pop up at CES.No, I don't want to aerate my wine and my toothbrush is quite intelligent enough already, thank you.But the winner by a mile is Kodak. As if to compensate for missing out on the digital camera boom, it has leapt aboard the crypto-currency and blockchain bandwagon.In a move that smacks of desperation, the company wants photographers to sign up for a scheme that will see their work registered for posterity using that magical creation blockchain, earning payments in Kodakcoin - a currency of uncertain value or usefulness.But it gets worse. The photography firm is also launching the Kodak KashMiner, which will allow anyone to become a Bitcoin miner.The idea is you rent the machine, and pay half the profits to Kodak, with the promise of a decent return on the upfront entry fee for the scheme.As Bitcoin experts pointed out, there are as many holes in this idea as a Swiss cheese - the price of Bitcoin is volatile, the energy costs are bound to soar and the crypto-currency is designed to get ever harder to mine.Still, investors liked it, sending Kodak shares soaring threefold at one point.Maybe they have studied blockchain technology and Bitcoin mining, and have reached a sober judgment of their value to Kodak. Or maybe not...CES will leave you with sore feet and indigestion, scoffing unhealthy food proffered by tech firms at news conferences, washed down with terrible coffee.But Baidu did things differently, welcoming visitors to its event at an elegant hotel with exquisite canapes and Lapsang Souchong tea.Even better, the Chinese company then cut through the usual tech jargon and corporate waffle with a clear message: we've got the experts, we've got the data, we've got a huge population, we are going to crush it in the battle to dominate AI.The award for services to gender diversity goes to the show's organiser the Consumer Technology Association.Huge posters in the Las Vegas Convention Center showed a wide range of women speakers in the conference programme.Actually, scrap that. The posters were a response to anger that all the main keynote speeches at CES were being made by men.Suddenly, the CTA decided having posters of Intel's Brian Krzanich and Ford's Jim Hackett and Richard Yu of Huawei looming over the attendees was not such a hot idea. So, it featured instead some of the women on panels lower down the bill.I'm not sure that quite does the trick in an industry notably lacking in diversity.After all, many of the tech firms exhibiting here have only just got round to thinking that ""booth babes"" - scantily clad women enticing visitors to come and see the products - are not such a great idea.Let's instead give the award to tech writer Kara Swisher.She dropped in briefly to Las Vegas to - as she tweeted - ""show dudes some not-dudes know tech"" with a panel of top female tech executives.Some tech entrepreneurs just don't know when they are beaten.Last year we featured the story of Danny Manu, who jetted in from Manchester on a budget flight to try to promote his Clik instant translation earbuds.We thought he faced a hard time up against the likes of Google and so it proved - a year later his earbuds, which he said would go on sale early in 2017, are still only available to pre-order.But he was back at CES in the Eureka Park start-up zone with his own little stand that had cost him a pretty penny.He is still optimistic that his earbuds can be a huge success.Given the fact that Google's Pixelbuds turned out to be pretty lame, maybe he stands a chance."
technology	Arsenal signs crypto-currency deal with gaming firm CashBet	'High risk'	"Arsenal has become the first major football club to sign a deal to promote a crypto-currency.The club has reached an agreement with the gaming company CashBet, which is planning to launch its own currency CashBet Coin.It will see CashBet Coin advertised at Arsenal's Premier League home games.But one crypto-currency expert has questioned whether the club is wise to promote what can be a very risky investment.CashBet is a Californian online gaming business formed in 2012, which is now launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). It aims to raise $40m by getting investors to buy CashBet Coins which can then be used to bet on its various online games.Arsenal's chief commercial officer Vinai Venkatesham said: ""We are looking forward to working with CashBet Coin as they launch their new crypto-currency.""I've asked Arsenal whether it was wise to endorse a highly volatile business and whether it was encouraging fans to bet with CashBet Coins.""Not at all. The partnership aims to promote CashBet Coin ahead of their Initial Coin Offer on 24 January,"" a spokesman for the club said.""It does not exist to encourage fans to bet with CashBet Coin.""ICOs have become an extremely popular way for businesses to raise money following the surge in value of Bitcoin, the original crypto-currency.But they are unregulated and investors who buy the coins have no stake in the business and receive no dividends. They hope to profit from the rising value of the crypto-currency.The Financial Conduct Authority has warned that ICOs are ""high-risk, speculative investments"".David Gerard, whose book ""Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain"" warns about the risks of investing in crypto-currencies, says Arsenal fans who might be encouraged to see CashBet Coins as a new way of betting need to be cautious.""Crypto-currencies are less regulated than regular betting shops and it's a lot harder to get actual pounds back out again,"" Mr Gerard said.While CashBet says it is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission and the Alderney Gambling Control Commission, a spokesman admitted that did not apply to its new crypto-currency venture.He said that punters who bet with CashBet's currency would eventually be able to convert their winnings into cash on third party exchanges."
technology	Salon magazine mines crypto-cash with readers' PCs	'Recouping revenues'Blocker beating	"News organisations have tried many novel ways to make readers pay - but this idea is possibly the most audacious yet.If a reader chooses to block its advertising, US publication Salon will use that person's computer to mine for Monero, a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin.Creating new tokens of a cryptocurrency typically requires complex calculations that use up a lot of computing power.Salon told readers: ""We intend to use a small percentage of your spare processing power to contribute to the advancement of technological discovery, evolution and innovation.""The site is making use of CoinHive, a controversial mining tool that was recently used in an attack involving government websites in the UK, US and elsewhere.However, unlike that incident, where hackers took control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency, Salon notifies users and requires them to agree before the tool begins mining.""I've opted-in to Salon's new revenue model using Coinhive,"" wrote security researcher Troy Mursch.""100% of my CPU [central processing unit] is now used by them to mine cryptocurrency. As my computer slows to crawl and quickly begins to heat up, I struggle to navigate their website.""The approach harnesses a computer's spare processing power when the user is browsing Salon.com after a user accepts a prompt asking for permission.Shortly after, the computer is put to work. Readers will likely hear their machine's cooling fans kick into action, and it will use more power.In a Frequently Asked Questions page on its website, Salon told readers the idea was part of a trial.""For our beta program, we’ll start by applying your processing power to mine cryptocurrencies to recoup lost ad revenue when you use an ad blocker,"" the company said.""We plan to further use any learnings from this to help support the evolution and growth of blockchain technology, digital currencies and other ways to better service the value exchange between content and user contribution.""Many internet users decide to install ad-blocking software to hide ads that appear within websites. However, for many companies, advertising is the only way to make money from readers.Several publications have experimented with ways around this, the most successful being complete paywalls - where users must pay a subscription to access the site - or metered systems where after a certain number of articles are accessed, the user must pay to carry on reading.News site Wired predicted that around 20% of its readers accessed the site using ad blockers, and so restricted the number of articles those readers saw unless Wired was added to a whitelist that would let advertising through."
technology	Bitcoin crosses $10,000 milestone	New heights	"The value of one bitcoin has gone past $10,000 (£7,493).The virtual currency reached the benchmark for the first time, just days after it passed $9,000.It caps a remarkable rise in value for the crypto-currency, which was trading below $1,000 at the start of the year.Some experts believe the asset still has far to soar, but others say it represents a speculative bubble with nothing tangible at its core that could burst any time.The total value of all the bitcoins in existence has now surpassed $167bn.Bitcoin first reached $1,000 in late-2013 and then dipped significantly before starting a volatile climb to its current value.It is not entirely clear what has driven the sudden rise in value, especially because the past few weeks have been marked by action by some financial regulators to limit its use.One factor that may have helped was the US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group's announcement at the start of the month that it planned to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of 2017, which bolstered confidence in its prospects.Another was a decision to drop a controversial plan known as Segwit2x.This would have altered the way Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, worked, to help it handle more transactions.But the move risked splitting the community.Many industry watchers believe the rapid rise in value will not be sustained and expect its value to suddenly fall sharply.Bitcoins were first produced in 2009 and took a long time to become an accepted holder of monetary value that could be swapped for real-world cash.One early transaction involved using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas.The boom has led to a general rise in many other virtual currencies.One, known as Ethereum, is now worth about $480, but at the start of 2017 each one was worth only about $10.Many others are also trying to profit from the growing interest in crypto-currencies.Many malware writers are now seeking to install software on vulnerable websites that create or ""mine"" the coins.In addition, scammers have sent fake text messages to people's phones, claiming they own some of the digital currency, in an effort to tempt them into opening a dangerous link."
technology	Bitcoin peaks above $5,000 for first time	Sell orders	"Bitcoin has crossed the $5,000 (£3,862) threshold for the first time.The virtual currency peaked at $5,103.91 in the early hours of Saturday, according to CoinDesk's price index.The record high helped push the total value of publicly traded crypto-currencies - including Ethereum and the Bitcoin-offshoot Bitcoin Cash - to more than $176bn.However, there has since been a sell-off.At time of writing, Bitcoin was 12% off its peak, at $4,485.At the start of the year, one bitcoin traded for less than $1,000, and as recently as July some market watchers feared that the currency could crash lower as a result of a mooted ""civil war"" over its future.However, since then, its value has been boosted, after most of its developers and miners - those who authorise transactions by contributing computing power - began implementing a compromise plan to let the technology handle more transactions per minute.In addition, August's ""fork"" of the underlying blockchain - the ledger of past Bitcoin transfers - created the new virtual currency Bitcoin Cash without causing major disruption to the original asset.Both events attracted media attention, which has been linked to Bitcoin's subsequent climb.Despite the current fallback, one expert said he expected Bitcoin to continue to rise over the medium term.""We've seen drops like this happen before when a particular number is hit - often because people have placed orders with exchanges to exit a currency when it reaches a certain value,"" said Eitan Jankelewitz, a specialist in crypto-currencies at the London-based law firm Sheridans.""And it's human nature to pick a round number [like $5,000].""But traditional investors are starting to view having crypto-currency as a small part of their diversified portfolios as an acceptable way to add risk.""Plus, there are more companies that are making it easy to buy Bitcoin at scale without having to understand how the technology works or how to keep it safe."""
technology	Tether crypto-currency operator reports $31m raid		"The company behind the digital currency Tether has said that close to $31m (£23.4m) worth of its tokens have been stolen.The Hong Kong-based company said it had taken action to prevent the thieves from redeeming the funds but now required other users to install an update.It follows a series of other recent scandals involving crypto-currencies.Bitcoin fell on the news but soon recovered most of its lost ground.Unlike many digital currencies, which tend to fluctuate wildly against the dollar, Tether is pegged to the US currency.This is supposed to protect investors from the volatility that can affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin, while allowing them to take advantage of a Blockchain-based asset suitable for fund transfers.According to Tether's operator, $30,950,010 worth of tokens were removed from one of the company's core ""treasury wallets"" and sent to an unauthorised Bitcoin address on 19 November.""A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future,"" the company said in a statement published on its site.It added that a software update should ""prevent any movement of the stolen coins from the attacker's address"" but only if other investors installed it ""immediately"".""We appreciate the community's patience, understanding, and support while we work to rectify the situation,"" it added.The news site Coindesk reported that several crypto-currency exchanges had taken steps to freeze trade in Tether following the announcement.Coindesk also reported that Tether had links to Bitfinex - a Hong Kong-based exchange that reported a hack last year blamed for about $65m of losses - although the report added that the ""nature of the connection"" was unclear.The BBC has contacted Tether to seek clarification on the matter.Other recent controversies involving digital currencies include:"
technology	Watchdog extends reach over crypto-cash investment	'Large valuations'	"A US regulator has said firms looking for backing via crypto-currencies should be more strictly regulated.Such investments should be registered in the same way as securities sales, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).It follows a rise in the number of Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, through which crypto-currency start-ups have sought quick financial backing.However, there are concerns that ICOs are creating an investment bubble.More than $1bn has been raised so far this year in such transactions but there are questions over how investors are to be protected should a venture backed with digital coins fail.Now the SEC has said that issuers of ""distributed ledger or blockchain technology-based securities"" must register offers and sales.""The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets,"" said Stephanie Avakian, the SEC enforcement division's co-director.It was sometimes difficult to see how a firm had justified a large evaluation for its ICO, said Eitan Jankelewitz, a technology specialist and partner at law firm Sheridans.""If you consider the size of the investment compared to the type of investment that a professional would make, they look disproportionally large,"" he told the BBC.He also pointed out that regulators don't need to rely on legislation specifically dealing with crypto-currencies to enforce rules on securities and investments.""Those sorts of regulations tend to be more principles-based,"" he explained.""If a new technology comes along that allows a new activity to be undertaken, then the law would still apply.""The SEC made its comments on ICOs in a report on a crypto-currency investment fund known as the DAO.Digital coins worth $60m ($41m) at the time were stolen after the DAO was hacked last year.While the SEC has not decided to make civil charges as a result of its investigation into what happened, it is using the case to caution industry and the market."
technology	Bitcoin hits $2,000 trading high point	Unsustainable bubble	"The value of Bitcoin has hit a new high with each individual coin now worth more than $2,100 (£1,615).The valuation caps a strong month for the virtual currency, with its value growing by more than 65% in a month.The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins.Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks.Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215).And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690).Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where.Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins.Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies.Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months.The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing.""The question is not if but when the market will turn,"" said an editorial in The Economist."
technology	Scenes from the crypto gold rush	What exactly is an ICO?	"Want to get in on the latest investment craze and make spectacular returns while feeling that you are at the cutting edge of crypto-currency technology?Keep this to yourself, but I've been told about two amazing schemes. And both of them provide more evidence that we're in the middle of another bubble.The first is called Wild Crypto and is that most fashionable of financial fandangos, an ICO - or initial coin offering - where projects with somewhat hazy business models raise funds by offering for sale their own currency.In this case, the idea is that you subscribe real cash - or rather you turn that real cash into the Ethereum crypto-currency - and in return you get a new currency called Wild coins.These can then be used to play on the lottery gaming platform that Wild Crypto is developing.The white paper, the document that is an essential but often opaque accompaniment to any ICO, explains it like this: ""Players will be able to take part in a global lottery and lottery-based games at significantly better odds than national lotteries.""We can do this because we are leveraging existing certified state-of-the-art technology, without the governmental overheads and bloat.""So this is basically an online gambling business raising funds prior to its launch, while giving investors no stake in its operations.They are handing over their money in the expectation that Wild coins will appreciate because the Wild Crypto lottery proves immensely popular with punters around the world.It is rather as if the makers of Monopoly were to ask investors to cough up to buy Monopoly money.But, of course, the wondrous blockchain technology underpinning this operation will enable it to run a much more efficient and trustworthy operation than the gaming world has seen to date - a claim I've seen, by the way, from other online gambling operations mounting similar ICOs.It won't have those costly ""governmental overheads"", which presumably include regulation. But that means it won't be allowed to operate in the USA, where they are none too keen on online gaming, or in the UK, where Wild Crypto would need a gaming licence - and, according to the Gambling Commission, it has yet to apply for one.Not so global a lottery as claimed, then, but that doesn't seem to have lessened interest in the ICO.Wild Crypto is aiming to raise $5m (£3.8m), and with 23 million out of 40 million Wild tokens sold in the first two days of a seven-day sale, things are going swimmingly.In simple terms, an initial coin offering is an unregulated means to raise funds for a new crypto-currency business.It allows investors to buy newly created tokens - known as coins - issued by a venture in return for more established virtual currencies, such as bitcoins or ethereum.It is often compared to an IPO (initial public offering) - but the obvious difference is that the public does not get a stake in the business itself.About $1.7bn (£1.3bn) has been raised via ICOs since the start of the year, according to one study, so the activity has undoubtedly been growing in popularity.However, it was banned in China earlier this week because of the risks involved.Singapore regulators have also warned that ICOs are potentially vulnerable to scams and terrorist financing.And their counterparts in the US, Russia, Canada and South Korea are among others to have indicated they may also intervene.My second example of crypto craziness is a scheme that allows holders of Bitcoin to use their ever more valuable funds to invest in property.In what is billed as a world first, Baroness Mone - who made her fortune from a lingerie business - and the entrepreneur Douglas Barrowman are offering apartments in a Dubai development that will be priced and sold in Bitcoin.Why? Apparently, it is a chance for those Bitcoin holders who have seen the value of their investment in the crypto-currency soar over the past year to crystallise their profits and put them into less volatile bricks and mortar.But why would the developers want to take on the risk of acquiring those Bitcoin assets from apartment buyers?It turns out they aren't. The buyers will have to convert their bitcoins into dollars when they complete their purchase, and although the apartments are ""priced"" in Bitcoin, that price will be adjusted in line with the currency's dollar exchange rate.So, what's the point? Well, it seems slapping the label Bitcoin or crypto-currency or blockchain on any project is the modern equivalent of adding ""dotcom"" to any old business in the late 1990s.Investors tempted to dive in should read up on what happened to many of those businesses a few years later."
technology	Bitcoin Cash deals frozen as insider trading is probed	Price surge	"One of the US's leading crypto-currency exchanges is carrying out an insider trading investigation.Coinbase fears its own workers may have exploited its move into Bitcoin Cash - a spin-off of the original Bitcoin.The San Francisco-based firm announced the move after Bitcoin Cash's price jumped.Coinbase began letting its users buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Tuesday in a surprise decision but has temporarily suspended trade.The company's chief executive intervened after several market watchers posted allegations of illegal activity on social media sites.Brian Armstrong responded that he had repeatedly warned his staff not to disclose its launch plans to family or friends or to trade in the digital asset themselves.""It appears the price of Bitcoin Cash on other exchanges increased in the hours before our announcement,"" he wrote on the blogging platform Medium.""If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies  -  directly or indirectly  - I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.""Bitcoin Cash - which is no more tangible than Bitcoin itself - came into being in August after several developers became frustrated at lengthening transaction times for the original crypto-currency.Bitcoin Cash addressed this problem by tweaking the underlying technology - the blockchain - to allow bigger chunks of data to be processed at a time.Although there have been other Bitcoin splits before, this ""fork"" was unusual in that everyone who owned the original virtual currency was offered a matching sum of Bitcoin Cash. This effectively created money out of nothing.However, many exchanges, including Coinbase, initially refused to support the innovation, casting doubt on its prospects.Claims of insider dealing were not the only hitch that Coinbase experienced when it finally added support for the new asset.Trade of Bitcoin Cash was frozen just four minutes after it began on the firm's Global Digital Asset Exchange (Gdax) and existing orders were cancelled.The move seems to have been a reaction to an apparent price surge in Bitcoin Cash on the platform beyond its already elevated level elsewhere.When Coinbase launched Bitcoin Cash at 17:20 PST (01:20 BST) it was valued at about $3,500 (£2,612) per coin.At the time it suspended it, the company was quoting a price of about $8,500. It remains unclear whether or not this was a software glitch or if deals were really being made at this level.Coinbase has yet to give a full explanation but has said that it intends to reopen Bitcoin Cash order books later on Wednesday.Bitcoin Cash is currently the world's third biggest crypto-currency with a total market capitalisation of about $59bn, according to Coinmarketcap.That compares with there being $77bn worth of Ethereum and $282bn worth of the original Bitcoin."
technology	Bitcoin industry 'sceptical' of Satoshi identity claim	Noisy methodMoving on	"Members of the Bitcoin community remain sceptical about Craig Wright's claim to be the mysterious creator of the digital currency.At the Consensus 2016 conference in New York, attendees told the BBC they wanted to see more proof before they would be ready to believe the claims.Mr Wright spoke to the BBC claiming he created the crypto-currency.Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, has confirmed the claim.Mr Andresen said he travelled to London to meet Mr Wright who showed him proof that he and Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym adopted by Bitcoin's creator - were one and the same.""He signed in my presence using the private key from block one, the very first mined Bitcoin block, on a computer that I am convinced had not been tampered with,"" he said.Each key is a unique digital code that is linked to specific bitcoins.But even he added: ""It is impossible to prove something like that 100%.""Scepticism about Mr Wright's claim has been fuelled by following the steps he put on his blog that, he said, show how to go about verifying cryptographic keys.Some queried the complicated series of steps in this process and the information they called upon. Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the process was ""maliciously resistant"" to validation.Mr Andresen said he could not explain why Mr Wright had chosen such a ""funky"" procedure as a proof.Others at the Consensus conference were more openly sceptical. Vitalik Buterin, from the blockchain company Ethereum, said the very ""noisy"" way in which Mr Wright chose to make this announcement threw into question whether it was true.""In general, signal theory says if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something and you choose the noisy way chances are it's because you couldn't do the good way in the first place.""Eric Voorhees, founder of cryptocurrency trading app ShapeShift, also had his doubts.""I generally trust Gavin [Anderseen]'s opinions so I want to believe this but I'm not convinced yet,"" he said.Others were more willing to believe that the elusive Bitcoin creator had finally been revealed.""I think it would be good news if Satoshi Nakamoto is found,"" said Daniel Lipshitz, from bitcoin infrastructure company Gap 600.He said while public proof from Mr Wright would be good, he trusted Mr Andresen and was willing to believe that he had seen compelling evidence.The digital currency industry is still developing. It has moved from the shady criminal underworld it was first associated with. Bitcoin, and the underlying blockchain technology it is based on, are now being invested in by the finance industry looking for the next place for innovation.""It's not clear to me that if Craig Wright is Satoshi, or if it's someone else, that this is relevant to Bitcoin these days,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, who has studied the genesis of the digital currency.""Some would argue that we are now living in a post-Satoshi world,"" he said. ""But I think Satoshi does matter, we should not dismiss their contribution.""However, he added, sessions at the Consensus conference and events in the wider world showed how the focus on the technology had shifted. Many financial firms were now looking at the blockchain that underlies bitcoin as a way to solve and streamline some long-standing payment processing problems.""The industry has moved,"" he said. ""The investment and interest is going into more and more non-currency uses."""
technology	Burger King launches WhopperCoin crypto-cash in Russia	Use and abuse	"Fast-food chain Burger King has launched its own crypto-currency, called WhopperCoin, in Russia.Customers will be able to claim one coin for every rouble (1.3p) they spend on the Whopper sandwich.Russians will be able to buy a Whopper with the virtual cash, once they have amassed 1,700 whoppercoins.The company said it would release Apple and Android apps next month so people could save, share and trade their wallet full of whoppercoins.Burger King has partnered with crypto-cash start-up Waves to create and run the scheme.The tech company will run the blockchain ledger for the coin to keep track of who has coins and what has been done with them.Customers will be able to claim their coins by scanning a receipt with a smartphone.The crypto-currency is a stand-alone system that has some technical similarities to Bitcoin but is distinct from it.This means the company would be able to shut the system down if it found it was being abused.In a statement, Waves said that it had already generated 1bn whoppercoins to use in the loyalty scheme.The current cost of a Whopper in Russia suggests customers will be able to get a free sandwich for every five or six they buy with real money.Ivan Shestov, head of external communications at Burger King Russia, said the scheme turned the Whopper into an ""investment vehicle"".On social media, some people reported that they had already managed to claim whoppercoins after eating at a Burger King in Russia.Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, said Burger King was the first major corporate brand to issue its own crypto-cash but he expected others to follow.""Traditional loyalty programs, such as airline miles, typically have a fairly limited range of exchange options,"" he said. The ease with which the branded crypto-currencies could be traded for other national currencies or even other assets could make them ""more compelling"" than a standard loyalty scheme, he added.But one issue that corporate issuers had to confront, he said, was who else would accept their crypto-currency.""I don't imagine McDonald's will be quick to allow someone to pay for a Big Mac with their whoppercoins,"" he said. ""Burger King's competitors are more likely to accept an independent crypto-currency like bitcoin.""Commenting on Twitter, Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor at Cornell University and a director at the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, said there were likely to be launches of other schemes.""Reward points are actually a good use case for blockchains,"" he said.However, in a later conversation, he warned that they could be used for money laundering and ransomware payments.""This will undoubtedly happen,"" he said."
technology	Tech Tent: Facebook and Google police their platforms	Crypto-currency ads banned	"How far should the two mightiest web giants go to police the content they enable?This week Google acted to ban crypto-currency advertising, while Facebook banned a far-right group.Tech Tent looks at growing evidence that the social media firms are now actively editing what appears on their platforms, rather than just sitting back and allowing their users complete freedom to share any kind of content.We hear from the South by Southwest festival where the usual optimism about the potential of tech - this after all was where Twitter took off - was replaced by anxiety about the damage social media can cause.London's Mayor Sadiq Khan made a speech giving examples of the online abuse he'd received, warning that this could deter people from entering politics.He is not the first politician to say ""something must be done"" about social media but he told the BBC that this kind of pressure was necessary: ""We can't assume tech companies will find solutions by themselves, they've got to be chivvied and cajoled to take action.""It was almost certainly a coincidence but a couple of days later Facebook did act, removing the pages belonging to the far-right groups Britain First and its leader and deputy leader.They had ignored a final written warning to stop posting material designed to promote the hatred of minority groups.Facebook had been under pressure for months to explain why Britain First was allowed to use its platform, given the fact that its Community Standards page states that organisations that promote hatred against these groups are not permitted a presence.It is clear that its social media megaphone, with its 2 million followers, was an extraordinarily effective platform for the group's attacks on Islam - indeed without Facebook there may not be much left of Britain First.The fact that the company finally acted will be seen by politicians of all kinds as proof that pressure can work - which means that Facebook can expect plenty more from across the political spectrum.For Google - the world's leading advertising platform - it was another kind of content that proved unwelcome this week. The search giant announced that from June, it would stop carrying advertising for certain financial products including ""crypto-currencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, crypto-currency exchanges, crypto-currency wallets and crypto-currency trading advice)"".Google does not really explain why it is fighting shy of the crypto-currency gold rush - which must be a lucrative source of revenue - except to say these are unregulated or speculative products.You might expect Coinbase, one of the world's leading exchanges for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, to be pretty annoyed about this. But its UK boss Zeeshan Feroz seemed pretty calm when he talked to Tech Tent.He told us that the ban was designed to curb false advertising, such as ""celebrity endorsements of investment products that promise to double your money in 10 days"", - and he welcomed that.But he said the ban was too broad, insisting just like everyone else I've ever met in the crypto-currency business that his firm was very different from all of those fast buck operators.""We are not in it just for the investment, our mission is to build an open financial system that entails these currencies being used for far more than just investment. We're trying to fundamentally redesign the financial system.""The evangelists of crypto-currencies and the blockchain will tell you that their industry is just like the web in 1994, poised to transform the way we live.But it seems that the biggest force on the web is not ready to buy into that message quite yet.Stream or download the latest Tech Tent podcast"
technology	Global manhunt for WannaCry creators	No RussiansMoney talks	"As organisations around the world clean up after being caught out by the WannaCry ransomware, attention has now turned to the people behind the devastating attack.The malware uses a vulnerability identified by the US National Security Agency, but it has been ""weaponised"" and unleashed by someone entirely different.So far, nobody seems to know who did it nor where they are.Mikko Hypponen, head of research at security company F-Secure, said its analysis of the malware had not revealed any smoking gun.""We're tracking over 100 different ransom Trojan gangs, but we have no info on where WannaCry is coming from,"" he told the BBC.The clues that might reveal who is behind it are few and far between.The first version of the malware turned up on 10 February and was used in a short ransomware campaign that began on 25 March.Spam email and booby-trapped websites were used to distribute WannaCry 1.0, but almost no-one was caught out by it.Version 2.0, which wrought havoc over the weekend, was the same as the original apart from the addition of the module that turned it into a worm capable of spreading by itself.Analysis of the code inside WannaCry had revealed little, said Lawrence Abrams, editor of the Bleeping Computer security news website, which tracks these malicious threats.""Sometimes with ransomware we can get a clue based on strings in the executables or if they upload it to Virus Total to check for detections before distribution,"" he said.Those clues could point to it being the work of an established group, he said, but there was little sign of any tell-tale text in the version currently circulating.""This launch has been pretty clean,"" said Mr Abrams.Other researchers have noticed some other aspects of the malware that suggest it might be the work of a new group.Many have pointed out that it is happy to infect machines running Cyrillic script.By contrast, much of the malware emerging from Russia actively tries to avoid infecting people in its home nation.Plus, the time stamp on the code suggests it was put together on a machine that is nine hours ahead of GMT - suggesting its creators are in Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines or the parts of China and Russia that are a long way east.There are other hints in the curious ways that WannaCry operates that suggest it is the work of people new to the trade.To begin with, the worm has been almost too successful, having hit more than 200,000 victims - many times more than are usually caught out by ransomware aimed at large organisations.Administering that huge number of victims will be very difficult.Whoever was behind it unwittingly crippled the malware by not registering the domain written in its core code.Registering and taking over this domain made it possible for security researcher Marcus Hutchins to limit its spread.There are other methods used to administer infected machines, notably via the Tor dark web network, and these addresses are being scrutinised for activity.There are other artefacts in the code of the malware that might prove useful to investigators, said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey.In particular, he said, law enforcement might be probing use of the kill-switch domain to see if it was queried before the malware was sent out.Other signifiers might be in the code for an entirely different purpose.""It's often the case that many criminals put deliberate false flags in there to confuse and obfuscate,"" he said.Also, most large-scale ransomware campaigns typically generate a unique bitcoin address for each infection.This makes it straightforward for the thieves behind the malware to make sure they restore the files only of people who have paid.WannaCry uses three hard-coded bitcoin addresses to gather ransom payments, and that is likely to make it challenging to work out who has paid, assuming the gang behind it does intend to restore locked files.The bitcoin payments might offer the best bet for tracking the perpetrators, said Dr James Smith, chief executive of Elliptic, which analyses transactions on the blockchain - the key part of bitcoin that logs who spent what.Bitcoin was not as anonymous as many thieves would like it to be, he said, because every transaction was publicly recorded in the blockchain.This can help investigators build up a picture of where the money is flowing to and from.""Ultimately criminals are motivated by money,"" he said, ""so eventually that money is going to be collected and moved.""The timing of that movement is going to be the big question, and we expect that will be down to how much gets paid in ransoms over the next few days.""Currently, the total paid to those bitcoin addresses is more than $50,000 (£39,000).""Everyone is watching those addresses very carefully,"" said Dr Smith."
technology	Bitcoin: Is the crypto-currency doomed?	What is Bitcoin?What are the problems?Who is Mike Hearn?How might the capacity of the network be increased?Why is there a dispute over this?How 'healthy' is Bitcoin?What will happen next?	"A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development.Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a ""failed"" project.Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development.So, is Bitcoin doomed?Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned.Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin.In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin ""mining"".Users have a ""bitcoin address"", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used.Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts.Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead.The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed.The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin.As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing.Indeed, some transactions face significant delays, hampering payments.Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable.Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years.In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time.He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network.Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB.But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted.He later wrote, ""It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable.""The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MBThere are alternatives, however.Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB.Bitcoin's history as a ""decentralised"" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature.Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation.Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers.Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say.""This is a matter of perspective,"" he told the BBC.""The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world.""However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted.""I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology,"" Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC.Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added.Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog.One bitcoin is now worth $380 (£265), down from about $430 on Thursday.However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile.It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015.But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year.Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security.Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred.Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many.Bitcoin remains popular.There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data.It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight.But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head.Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen.Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt.But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet.Update: This report was changed on 19 January 2016 to clarify that some payments can take a considerable time to be processed rather than not going through at all."
technology	Government urged to use Bitcoin-style digital ledgers	Tax recordsEstablishing trust	"The UK's chief scientific adviser has urged the government to adopt the technology that powers crypto-currency Bitcoin to run various public services.Bitcoins are powered by blockchains - digital ledgers that record information from Bitcoin transactions to DNA.Sir Mark Walport has argued that they could be used by government departments as a more secure way of managing data.They could be used to help with tax collection, benefits or the issuing of passports, he has said.Blockchains consist of ""blocks"" of data in a digital ledger.Copies of these ledgers are shared by all the computers that access them, meaning they are distributed across the network.Because blockchains act as permanent records of every time that data is added to them - and because private blockchains allow access to specific users only - they are thought to be highly resistant to malicious tampering.Sir Mark's recommendation comes in the form of a new report which advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of services.""Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services,"" the report says.""In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely, according to exact rules.""Sir Mark added that existing approaches to data management in government departments typically involved large centralised systems with ""a high cost single point of failure"".These systems may also be more vulnerable to hacking or errors, he wrote.Using distributed ledgers and storing multiple copies of them is something that has helped been made possible by the improvement in computing technology, according to Dave Birch, at consultants Consult Hyperion.""I think the report is really interesting,"" he told the BBC.However, Mr Birch added that he was initially unsure of why blockchains - specific types of ledgers that require users to agree on the state of their contents - would be useful.""When you say 'blockchain', that's a very specific kind of consensus protocol and one of the key reasons for using that is because there may be people trying to subvert [the data],"" he said.""I can see the report talks about distributed ledger technology in general. The issue is, can distributed ledgers help in certain kinds of government ledgers - the answer is almost certainly yes.""The report suggests that the British government should begin trials of distributed ledger technology to see how usable it is.Some countries have already taken the step.Texas-based firm Factom announced last year that it was working with Honduras to build a blockchain record of land registry titles - though the project later appeared to be on hiatus.The report notes another example, Estonia, which already uses distributed ledger technology for citizens to check the integrity of their records on government databases."
technology	Ransomware 'here to stay', warns Google study	Track and trace	"Cyber-thieves have made at least $25m (£19m) from ransomware in the last two years, suggests research by Google.The search giant created thousands of virtual victims of ransomware to expose the payment ecosystem surrounding the malware type.Most of the money was made in 2016 as gangs realised how lucrative it was, revealed a talk at Black Hat.Two types of ransomware made most of the money, it said, but other variants are starting to emerge.""It's become a very, very profitable market and is here to stay,"" said Elie Bursztein from Google who, along with colleagues Kylie McRoberts and Luca Invernizzi, carried out the research.Ransomware is malicious software that infects a machine and then encrypts or scrambles files so they can no longer be used or read. The files are only decrypted when a victim pays a ransom. Payments typically have to be made using the Bitcoin virtual currency.Mr Bursztein said Google used several different methods to work out how much cash was flowing towards ransomware creators.As well as drawing on reports from people who had paid a ransom, it sought out the files used to infect machines and then ran those on lots of virtual machines to generate ""synthetic victims"", he said.Cyber-hacks season:It then monitored the network traffic generated by these victims to work out to where money would be transferred. The data gathered in this stage was also used to find more variants of ransomware and the 300,000 files it found broke down into 34 of them, he said.The most popular strains were the Locky and Cerber families, added Mr Bursztein.Payment analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, which logs all transactions made using the e-currency, revealed that those two strains also made the most money over the last year, he said, with Locky collecting about $7.8m (£5.9m) and Cerber $6.9m (£5.2m).The research project also revealed where the cash flowed and accumulated in the Bitcoin network and where it was converted back into cash. More than 95% of Bitcoin payments for ransomware were cashed out via Russia's BTC-e exchange, found Google.On 26 July, one of the founders of BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested by Greek police on money laundering charges. The police were acting on a US warrant and his extradition to America is being sought.The gangs behind the ransomware explosion were not likely to stop soon, said Mr Bursztein, although established strains are facing competition from newer ones.""Ransomware is a fast-moving market,"" he said. ""There's aggressive competition coming from variants such as SamSam and Spora.""Novel variants were expanding quickly and many were encouraging fast expansion by paying affiliates more if they placed the malware on to large numbers of machines. The ransomware as a service model was already proving popular, he warned.""It's no longer a game reserved for tech-savvy criminals,"" he said. ""It's for almost anyone.""This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security.

technology	Bitcoin could split in debate over currency's future	Consensus on consensus	"A row over changing the software that produces bitcoins could split the virtual currency, core developers say.Bitcoin XT, a new version, is currently being recommended by the currency's chief scientist, Gavin Andresen.And its developer, Mike Hearn, says its adoption is essential to ensure the currency can cope with growing demand.But some, including a large number of bitcoin miners in China, are resisting XT because of how it might affect control over the currency.Bitcoin's blockchain - a digital ledger of all transactions made with the currency - is currently made up of 1MB blocks.Bitcoin XT would enable these blocks to grow to 8MB.But this would mean XT was no longer compatible with existing Bitcoin software, creating, its detractors say, two separate currencies and eroding trust in both.Mr Hearn told the BBC the Bitcoin community's reaction to the release of the XT software at the weekend had been mixed, but there were some encouraging signs.""We've gone from zero people running the software to 10% of the network in 72 hours, which is really good,"" he saidBut many are unhappy the core development team at Bitcoin is currently in disagreement over whether Bitcoin XT is right for the future of the currency.A pool of large Chinese mining groups, for example, have said they will not adopt the software unless it is unanimously adopted by the core team.Mr Hearn said he had decided to force the issue in order to overcome the stalemate.""If you look at the guys working on the Bitcoin core, they talk about consensus all the time - but if you ask them what they really mean, they can't tell you,"" he said.""There is no consensus about what consensus means.""Mr Hearn acknowledged, however, the reduced control developers had under XT would mean they would have to split the currency a second time if they were unhappy with future decisions.""If we go off the rails and do things that aren't in the best interests of the community, then the solution is fork it again,"" he said.Dr Vili Lehdonvirta, at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the adoption of Bitcoin XT would mean ""the community has much fewer guarantees of being listened to"".""Those algorithms are made by humans and whoever writes them gets to have power over the system,"" he told the BBC.Dr Lehdonvirta added increasing block size could potentially make Bitcoin less accessible.""Downloading the whole blockchain is already such an effort that most people choose not to run Bitcoin on their computers,"" he said.""This would put Bitcoin on a trajectory where that problem is exaggerated."""
technology	Bitcoins used in child sex abuse deals targeted	Money web	"Bitcoins used to buy images of child sex abuse could soon be tracked and blocked as two companies share data on how the virtual currency is spent.The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which tracks abuse sites, is passing data to start-up Elliptic, which helps Bitcoin exchanges monitor transactions.The data comes from transactions carried out on sites the IWF monitorsThe IWF said the ""pseudo-anonymity"" offered by bitcoins made them an increasingly popular form of payment.""We are seeing it being used on the more dedicated commercial abuse sites that we monitor on a regular basis,"" said Sarah Smith, IWF's technical researcher.Ms Smith said the IWF had first noticed the virtual currency being used in 2014 alongside other payment systems, but its use on abuse sites was growing alongside other illicit use of the virtual cash.Bitcoins' ""pseudo-anonymity"" made it a very attractive payment system in criminal circles, she added.The IWF's work to disrupt abuse sites had left it with a list of Bitcoin addresses associated with sites selling abuse content and their customers, said Ms Smith.This list and any other addresses the IWF finds are being passed to tech company Elliptic to help in its work to curb criminal use of bitcoins.""This is the first time anybody has started identifying these crimes in Bitcoin and flagging them up in a system like ours,"" said James Smith, head of Elliptic, adding that it was a ""great step"" towards eliminating illicit use of bitcoins.Elliptic analyses the Bitcoin blockchain - the virtual currency's central ledger in which every deal done with the digital cash is recorded - to spot stolen coins, to trace transactions that seek to hide their criminal origins or to conceal the illegal uses to which they are put.It passes information about the web of dodgy transactions to exchanges and other merchants to help them avoid doing business with ""known bad actors"" and to stop them being inadvertently enrolled in money-laundering schemes."
technology	Can tech solve the Brexit border puzzle?	Do we really need border checks?Do they have to be at the geographic border?Don't we already have IT systems for customs?Does everyone think so?Will number plate recognition help?What about other technologies?	"There are two competing visions of how goods will flow in and out of the UK after Brexit.Either the M20 will become a lorry park as endless customs checks at Dover choke the motorway. Or technology will help create frictionless borders and exporters will hardly notice any change.The truth, according to those who have studied the issue, is somewhere between the two. So, can technology solve the border puzzle?Right now there are no customs checks at Dover or other borders with EU countries. After Brexit there will be - unless the idea floated by the UK of an invisible border gets a better reception in Europe than it has today.Whatever the nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU after we leave, it seems certain that there will be added bureaucracy for both companies and the government, but technology should lighten the load.Even if there are no tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, companies will probably have to show where their goods have originated, otherwise this country could be used to get something like New Zealand lamb onto the continent without any limits.Not necessarily - they can be conducted at factories before the goods depart, and much of the paperwork will in fact be digital, carried out online.If the UK sticks with the EU's safety and quality standards, there will have to be checks to make sure goods match up to those benchmarks and that doesn't have to be done at a port or border.But it will all depend on improved IT systems.Yes, but they are fairly old. Brexit Secretary David Davis says a new system will be in place by early 2019.It appears he is referring to the upgrade of HMRC's customs processing system, Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (Chief), which is more than 20 years old and was due to be replaced even before the Brexit vote.The new system is called CDS - Customs Declaration Service - and is being developed in part by IBM. HMRC admits that it may now have to accommodate five times as many customs declarations as originally envisaged, but says it's confident that it will be ready in time.Not quite. Last month the National Audit Office said HMRC faced ""some significant challenges to deliver the programme within the current timetable"" and gave it an amber risk rating.But even if the system is up and running with all exporters on board, that won't be enough to create a frictionless border.Ports like Dover will need to install new technology, including number plate recognition, to match the lorries driving on and off ferries with the customs declarations lodged in the CDS system.This is not cutting edge technology and is in use elsewhere in the world, but HMRC seems dubious that it will be in place by March 2019 and says it would benefit from an implementation period.More exporters will also be pressed to become AEOs - Authorised Economic Operators - taking advantage of an existing system which many large companies use to speed up the customs process.Other solutions being floated include using the blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrencies to make the sharing of data about exports much simpler, and employing artificial intelligence to decide where random checks on shipments crossing the borders should be targeted.But with the deadline for getting back control of the UK's borders just 18 months away, such innovative technology ideas are not priorities for the civil servants entrusted with this task.In fact, making sure there are no traffic jams in Dover will be more about the arts of management, politics and the law than technology."
technology	Becoming a virtual Estonian		"I've just acquired a whole new identity. It comes in the form of a plastic card with a chip in it, and it means that I am now a resident of Estonia. Or rather an e-resident, because this card is a symbol of Estonia's bold ambition - to export its expertise in digital identity to the wider world.The e-Residency programme, which has already attracted 10,000 people from around the world, offers anyone who pays 100 Euros some of the benefits of the digital ID cards which Estonia's 1.3 million citizens have had for more than a decade.I meet Kaspar Korjus, the young manager of this project, at the e-Estonia showroom in Tallinn, where the government shows foreign visitors the progress it has made down the road to digital public services. Kaspar starts by showing me his own digital ID - he's 38712012796 by the way, though that won't be useful to you without his card and two PIN numbers.We go online to a site where he can check which data is held, linked to his ID. - his doctor, his driving licence, his family circumstances. He explains that he has control over that data and it could not be shared without his agreement. His ID card is even used for voting - ""I've been travelling quite a lot - the last four times I was away but I could still vote. I use PIN 1 to confirm who I am, PIN 2 to vote.""While e-residency will not allow me to vote, or permit someone from outside the EU to travel here without a visa, it does confer a number of advantages. It makes it a lot easier to set up a business and open a bank account, and you can use the card to digitally sign documents and contracts.This is a country which does not worry about immigration - indeed it would like more people to move here. Kaspar tells me they are put off by the weather and the remoteness of Estonia but the hope is that e-residents will boost the economy by starting businesses here without needing to move.He quotes one example - Stanislaw, a painter from Ukraine, who was unable to sell his pictures because his country does not have the infrastructure to allow him to accept foreign payments. ""PayPal will work with someone who has a business address in Estonia,"" says Kaspar, ""but not with someone in Kiev."" Now the artist has established a company in Estonia and is selling his paintings around the world while remaining in Kiev.One obvious thought strikes me about the e-Residency program - isn't it all about avoiding tax? ""It's actually the complete opposite,"" says Kaspar Korjus. ""Every transaction is recorded, your identity is there, it's all very transparent."" The expectation is that just about all e-residents will pay tax on any earnings where they are generated - in their home countries - and the Estonian government will transmit details of revenues back to local tax authorities.Estonia hopes to benefit because of the business generated for its banking and advisory services, rather than in direct revenues. Then there is the interesting prospect of linking this digital identity service to the blockchain, the technology underlying the virtual currency Bitcoin.One such experiment is already underway. NASDAQ, which runs the Tallinn stock exchange, is creating an e-voting scheme, allowing shareholders to vote at annual general meetings. The e-Residency platform will be used to identify voters, while the blockchain will provide a fast and secure way of recording the votes.The e-Residency project is very much a work in progress. While it's of limited use to me at the moment, I can see my new digital identity becoming a way to authenticate myself on e-commerce sites and other places which want to know you are who you say you are.Kaspar Korjus is convinced that this is an idea whose time has come, and countries will compete to offer this kind of virtual citizenship: ""We are the first mover - there will be lots of e-Residency programmes."" He has been set a target of attracting 10 million e-Estonians by 2025. That sounds ridiculously ambitious, but this tiny country has already shown that, when it comes to being digital, it can punch far above its weight.You can hear more about my adventures in Estonia on Friday's Today Programme on Radio 4 and on Tech Tent on the BBC World Service."
technology	Extortion attempt on victims of Patreon site hack		"Some members of the crowdfunding website Patreon, which was hacked last month, say they have received emails demanding bitcoin payments in return for the protection of their private data.The data listed in the email includes credit card details, social security numbers and tax identification numbers.Patreon says the email is a scam and the information is false.The site allows people to make regular donations to artists for projects.The email, tweeted by cartoonist Steve Streza, says: ""Unfortunately, your data was leaked in the recent hacking of the Patreon website, and I now have your information.""It goes on to ask for one bitcoin (£213; $322) in return for not publishing the information online.There appear to have been three transactions made to the bitcoin wallet given in the email over the weekend, but each is for a tiny fraction of the virtual currency, amounting to just a few pence, according to the Blockchain, a continuing record of every bitcoin transaction made.About 15GB of data, including names, addresses and donations, was published online in October following the hack attack on Patreon.At the time, chief executive Jack Conte said card details had not been stolen.""We do not store full credit card numbers on our servers and no credit card numbers were compromised,"" he wrote on the company's blog.""Although accessed, all passwords, social security numbers and tax form information remain safely encrypted with a 2,048-bit RSA key.""Security expert Troy Hunt told the BBC the hack had been made possible by site tests.""It looks as though the breach has come about by a fundamental yet very common mistake software developers... make - taking a copy of live production data and placing it in another location that lacks the same rigorous security controls,"" he said.""Often this is done for testing purposes and is a very dangerous shortcut as we've now seen."""
technology	Bitcoin miners generating high energy bills		"Bitcoin is facing fresh scrutiny after a report revealed the power requirements of the currency's miners.Tracking website Blockchain logged 982 megawatt hours of electricity consumption over a 24-hour period by Bitcoin miners around the world.According to Bloomberg, that is enough to power 31,000 homes in the US. Watchdog Ofgem claims the average UK household uses 3.3MwH per year.Blockchain said the rough cost of that amount of power was $147,000 (£95,000).However, it also suggested profits of $681,000 (£444,000) may have been made as a result of the mining.Bitcoins are earned online by completing difficult computing tasks.Mining involves solving a hard mathematical problem and miners typically use large numbers of computers to speed up the number-crunching involved.The more mining takes place, the harder it becomes to mine new Bitcoins and the more power is required for the process.Writer Mark Gimein described the energy requirements as ""an environmental disaster"" in a blog post for Bloomberg.""Real-world mining of precious metals for currency was a resource-hungry and value-destroying process. Bitcoin mining is too,"" he wrote.However, other analysts disagree.Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, dismissed the quantity of electricity being used for mining as ""trivial"" on the website Forbes.""There are around 120 million or so households in the US. Therefore Bitcoin mining is consuming 0.025% of the US household electricity supply,"" he wrote.""This is without even thinking about the energy requirements of business and industry. Do also note that that is the power consumed by globalBitcoin mining... I feel secure in stating that Bitcoin mining really isn't a real-world environmental disaster."""
technology	Tech Tent: Net neutrality, new coins, and indoor farming	Net Neutrality - the endless battleIndiegogo bets on magic moneyLighting up the future of farming	"Is that vote to scrap net neutrality really a threat to the future of the internet? On Tech Tent this week we look at what happens now that the US has decided to get rid of rules which stop telecoms firms from discriminating between different forms of net traffic. We also hear from the crowdfunding site that's decided to join the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze and we find out why cheaper lighting technology is making indoor farming viable.To campaigners who had fought long and hard for what they considered a founding principle of the internet, it's a disaster for freedom and creativity. To those who voted to remove the net neutrality principles brought in by the Obama administration it is a welcome end to burdensome regulation which threatened to harm the future development of the net.Whether this is as hot a topic for millions of internet users is open to question. But the issue has been brought to a wider public by the comedian John Oliver on his US TV show - and if you want a clear explanation of the arguments look no further than this excellent BBC video.Although this is particularly controversial in the US where 50 million people have only one broadband provider to choose from, it is a global issue. In India, Facebook had to withdraw a programme offering free access on mobile phones to some websites because it was seen as discriminating against those sites not included.And the FCC's ruling does not mean the battle is over. New York's attorney general has already announced plans to co-operate with other states to fight the move in court. The Democrats seem convinced that net neutrality matters to young voters. Believe it or not, complex matters of telecoms regulation could become a key battleground in next year's mid-term elections.The extraordinary surge in the value of Bitcoin has in turn created another investment boom in what are known as ICOs, Initial Coin Offerings where companies create their own virtual currencies to fund various projects.While substantial sums are being poured into ICOs their reputation remains, not to put too fine a point on it, dodgy. Regulators have warned investors to be prepared to lose all their money.But this week, crowdfunding site Indiegogo announced it would be adding ICOs to its portfolio of services.""Investors are looking for vetted ICO opportunities,"" co-founder Slava Rubin tells Tech Tent.When I put it to him that many saw these ventures as dodgy attempts to create magic money, he didn't argue with those descriptions. But he said Indiegogo would be carefully vetting the companies before putting just a selected few in front of investors.In recent weeks, there have been stories of people taking out mortgages to invest in Bitcoin and there is surely a danger of similarly reckless behaviour as the ICO boom gathers speed.But Mr Rubin says he is just trying to democratise this new investment opportunity: ""I do not endorse mortgaging your home,"" he says, ""but these opportunities should not be only for the rich.""The danger is that Indiegogo which has spent years trying build trust in crowdfunding, will see that good work undone if ICOs it has vetted go badly wrong.But like many enthusiasts caught up in the excitement of the crypto craze Mr Rubin points to the early days of the internet boom as justification for optimism. He reckons that just as some great businesses emerged from the wreckage of the dotcom crash, so some winners will be born from the blockchain technology underpinning many ICOs.Still, if Bitcoin crashes the ICO bubble is likely to pop too - and that could end up causing plenty of damage to the finances and reputations of those who have evangelised about our cryptocurrency future.As the world's population increases, yet resources become more scarce, and the need to cut emissions gets ever more urgent, could growing crops indoors in vast warehouses close to where they will be eaten help reduce the environmental impact of our food?Lots of companies have tried this idea, but they've struggled to make the economics add up. Now a US startup called Plenty with $200m (£150m) in funding including investment from Jeff Bezos thinks it can succeed where others have failed.Co-founder Matt Barnard tells us that the firm's warehouses can generate up to 300 times as much food as a conventional farm on the same footprint. Right now, they are growing salad leaves and herbs but have plans to produce strawberries, tomatoes and melons.So what makes this work so efficiently? ""It all stems from the fact that we fully control the plant's environment,"" he says. ""We're able to give them ideal conditions, difficult or impossible to achieve in the field.""But he says this would not have been possible just a few years ago when the price of LED lighting was much higher: ""To buy light would have cost 64 times more in 2010 than it does today.""He says the same pattern could be seen in the success of other technology advances - Google would have faced more than double the data storage costs if it had started a couple of years earlier, Tesla could not have got off the ground if battery costs had been much higher.So Matt Barnard believes the time is right for indoor farming to transform food production. It's a bold claim but if he is right, a big prize awaits Plenty and its backers."
technology	Tech tent: Will fintech flee London?	Will fintech flee London?Germany's wi-fi desertCoding for refugees	"On this week's Tech Tent we look at London's drive to make sure it remains the world's leading centre of fintech - or financial technology.We find out why it's so hard to find a wi-fi hotspot in Germany, and we visit a coding school for refugees.From mobile payment apps to digital currencies, from the blockchain to artificially intelligent insurance brokers, financial technology is one of the hottest areas for tech investment.And London, one of the world's most important financial centres with plenty of talented software engineers, is regarded as just about the best city on earth for anyone starting a fintech business.But will that continue to be the case after the UK leaves the European Union?The British government certainly hopes so, and it convened the International Fintech conference in London this week to bang that message home.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, and the Bank of England governor Mark Carney, took to the stage to tell the delegates that the UK had a unique mix of the right talent and the right kind of regulation to allow fintech to thrive.But we hear a rather different message from the founder of TransferWise, probably the most successful fintech firm to be born in the UK.Taavet Hinrikus, who came to the UK from Estonia to start a money transfer business that now employs over 600 people, says Brexit has made everything uncertain.His principal concern is about access to talent because he fears skilled people are already being put off from coming to the UK.But he's also concerned about the loss of passporting, which allows financial firms to operate across the European Union.So would he still start a business in the UK today, I ask him?""Probably not,"" he replies.""When it comes to how easy it is to get people to come to London, we don't know how it will be in two years time... it is the right thing to consider whether you should do it in Amsterdam or Berlin or any other city in Europe.""But we get a more cheerful view from Erik Abrahamsson, who launched his social media insurance business Digital Fineprint in London last year.He says investment did dry up for a while after the Brexit vote but now the weak pound is helping him attract overseas investors and customers because his products look cheaper to them.Around the world people now take it for granted that you can pop into a cafe or a public space and get online via a wi-fi network.But in Germany you will struggle - there are about half as many wi-fi hotspots per head as in the UK.As our correspondent Joe Miller explains - from one of the few Berlin cafes that offer free wi-fi - that is because businesses fear the consequences of people using their wireless networks to do something illegal.German law makes them responsible if someone downloads pirated content.And as German copyright owners are very hot on defending their rights, that can prove costly.Now there is a new draft law going through the German parliament which makes it clear that third parties should not be liable for the activities of those using wireless networks illegally.That could make offering hotspots easier, but copyright holders will still be able to demand that access to their content is blocked on wireless networks where piracy has been detected.Germany, like every modern economy, wants to be seen as a highly connected nation, but when it comes to public wi-fi it is still in the slow lane.Graduation ceremonies are always inspiring events, but the one which Tech Tent attended this week in London was a real celebration of what the technology community can achieve.We had come to see the first graduates of Code Your Future, a coding school for refugees, showing off their web development projects to friends and to the volunteers who had taught them.The six-month course was the brainchild of German Bencci, who had heard about a similar project in Amsterdam.He mobilised volunteers from the technology industry who taught the refugees face-to-face every Sunday, then monitored their work online during the week.We meet him and two of the students, Arockia Ansi from India and Sentahyu Mekoonn from Ethiopia.The hope is that the skills they have learned will gain them jobs as software developers in a country which, like many, is always short of engineering talent.A new class has now started the course and the hope is that Code Your Future can expand with classes in Manchester and Glasgow."

"A leading figure in the Bitcoin community has expressed regret about a blog backing an Australian's claim to have invented the crypto-currency.Craig Wright announced on Monday that he was behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by Bitcoin's creator.The same day, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote he was ""convinced beyond a reasonable doubt"" of Dr Wright's case.But Mr Andresen said he now thinks it was a ""mistake"" to have posted.The expert had written that he had privately witnessed Dr Wright using cryptographic keys that ""only Satoshi should possess"".But critics called Dr Wright's claim into doubt when it emerged that part of the evidence the entrepreneur presented in public could have been generated using a string of digits linked to a seven-year-old transaction made by Satoshi, accessible via a search engine.""It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his - I assumed his post would simply be a signed message anybody could easily verify,"" Mr Andresen told security researcher Dan Kaminsky when he challenged the scientist over the matter.""Of course he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some bitcoins through the key associated with an early block.""Mr Andresen has yet to update his blog to reflect this change of view.Dr Wright has promised to present further ""extraordinary proof"" including ""independently-verifiable documents"" and the transfer of a bitcoin from one of the virtual currency's early blocks, which Satoshi would have access to.At this point, he still has the backing of Jon Matonis - the Bitcoin Foundation's founding director - who has said he has ""no doubt"" that Dr Wright is responsible for the Bitcoin technology.But Mr Kaminsky said he now disbelieved Dr Wright's claims bearing in mind Mr Andresen's own doubts.""Gavin is making no excuses for Wright,"" Mr Kaminsky told the BBC,""I don't expect Wright to deliver on his lofty promises, but I also don't expect him to go away.""Some people just like negotiating with reality.""Dr Wright has said he does not plan to give any further interviews.But in his most recent blog he noted: ""For some there is no burden of proof high enough, no evidence that cannot be dismissed as fabrication or manipulation. This is the nature of belief and swimming against this current would be futile.""Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned.Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin.In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin ""mining"".Users have a ""bitcoin address"", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used.Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts.Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead."
technology	Apple warms to apps using virtual currencies		"Apps accepting payments made with virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, could soon appear in Apple's app store.The firm has changed its policy for apps to allow software developers to use ""approved virtual currencies"".Apple has yet to publish a list of which virtual currencies it considers to be ""approved"".Many have taken this to mean that the Bitcoin cyber-cash system will soon be included in Apple apps as it is the most widely used virtual currency.The policy change marks a significant shift for Apple, which before now has been aggressive in its policing of apps that use virtual currencies.In late 2013 and early 2014 Apple took action against apps that used virtual cash even though many of the programs had been available on the store for months. Some apps removed virtual currency code from their program so they could stay on the store but others were forced out altogether.Gliph, CoinJar, Coinbase, Blockchain and other apps were all affected by the action.By contrast, Google has had a much more open policy, and there are now many Android apps that support different virtual currencies.Gliph developer Rob Banagale told the Bloomberg news service that he was now planning to submit a new version of his app to Apple that restored its ability to send and receive payments in bitcoins.Virtual currencies are built around shared software that generates or ""mines"" coins by getting lots of computers to carry out complicated mathematical operations.Apple's decision comes as satellite TV firm Dish says it will accept payments made in bitcoins.In addition, the value of one bitcoin has been steadily rising in recent weeks.In late November 2013 each bitcoin was briefly worth about $1,000 (£596) but the value collapsed soon after.Current exchange rates suggest each one is now worth about $650."
technology	Hackers hit web accounts of MtGox boss		"Hackers have taken over some of the web accounts of Mark Karpeles - boss of the troubled MtGox Bitcoin exchange.The attack on Mr Karpeles seems to have been motivated by growing frustration over the actions of MtGox.Last month MtGox stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy after finding out that $465m (£279m) in bitcoins had been lost via a security bug.Many have called on the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost bitcoins.The attacks were mounted on the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr Karpeles and left the hackers in charge of both social media accounts.The attackers used their access to grab detailed information about trading activity at MtGox. They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.The material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word ""Goxed"" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg.He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network."
technology	Has Craig Wright proved he's Bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto?	I missed it, what happened?This is about cryptography, so did he provide proof?Is that all?Where does this leave us?How could this be resolved?Are there any other candidates that could be Satoshi?Why would anyone go to these lengths?Why does this matter?	"Scepticism has greeted a claim by Craig Wright that he is the inventor of Bitcoin. His claim has been subjected to scrutiny on social media, discussion forums and message boards. Many say the evidence has been found wanting.On 2 May, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of the Bitcoin virtual currency.In interviews with the BBC, the Economist and GQ, he said he was the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by whoever dreamed up Bitcoin in email exchanges with cryptographers and developers in the early days of the virtual currency.His claim was backed by Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, and Jon Matonis, an economist and a founding director of the same organisation.Some. In demonstrations to the Bitcoin experts, the BBC and the Economist, he used the Electrum Bitcoin wallet to sign a message using private keys from early Bitcoin blocks widely assumed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto.But as the Economist said in its report about Mr Wright, such demonstrations can be ""stage-managed"" and many doubters have said it was poor practice to let him use his own laptop and software of his choosing for this demonstration.However, Mr Andresen's encounter with Mr Wright was more rigorous. In that case, a Windows laptop was bought from a nearby shop, unboxed and the Electrum wallet software installed on it.Read more:Craig Wright 'to move' Satoshi coinBitcoin industry 'sceptical' of Satoshi identity claimAustralian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creatorMr Wright then signed an arbitrary message - ""Gavin's favorite number is eleven. CSW"" - with a key from an early block. The signed message was put on a USB stick, moved to the new laptop and checked. This revealed the signature to be valid.No. In addition, Mr Wright also posted information on his blog that he said would show that he was Satoshi, again because of the digital signature linked to those early blocks.Many people jumped on this evidence and soon after revealed that there was no digital signature in it. Instead, it uses a short list of numbers any competent Googler could find. The string of numbers comes from a 2009 bitcoin transaction carried out by Satoshi.In limbo. On the one hand, we have two key figures in the Bitcoin community convinced Craig Wright is Satoshi. Others have joined them.On the other, we have a huge number of sceptics utterly unconvinced by evidence that is very weakly linked to Satoshi. Developer Patrick McKenzie pointed out that anyone could use it to claim they were Bitcoin's progenitor.Mr Andresen did entertain the possibility that he has been ""bamboozled"" by an elaborate effort to make the test he saw look more real than it actually was. But, he said, he was still convinced that Craig Wright is Satoshi.With more proof. Many, including the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones, have called on Craig Wright to spend some of the bitcoins locked up in those early blocks to demonstrate that he has control of them.However, as others have pointed out, all this would show is that he has access to the private keys for these bitcoins, not that he was Satoshi.Some suggest the confusion around Satoshi's identity has arisen because it was a name adopted by the small group of developers that worked on Bitcoin in its early days. This group involved Mr Wright, Hal Finney and David Kleiman. As the only surviving member of that group Mr Wright could claim to be Satoshi but would not have access to all the data that could be used to definitively prove this assertion.The Economist has publicly called on Mr Wright to provide more proof. That could soon be forthcoming, said a statement from his PR agency.""In the coming days Dr Wright will provide further evidence as to him being Satoshi and the creator of Bitcoin by moving a coin from an early block.""Not really. Bitcoin watchers and journalists have been seeking the man behind Satoshi for years. During that time the focus has fallen on Finnish economists, Japanese mathematicians, cybercriminals and Japanese-American physicists. All the people named in those searches have denied being Satoshi.In December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo put forward Craig Wright's name as a potential candidate after receiving documents and emails reportedly stolen from him that showed his involvement with the virtual currency.After reviewing the evidence, Wired remained unsure, saying: ""Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.""We don't know. Critics of Mr Wright point to his continuing dispute with the Australian tax authorities as one reason why he might need a way to explain away his possession of large amounts of bitcoins.For his part Mr Wright said he is undergoing audits by the Australian Tax Office over the amount of tax he has to pay but this is complicated by the fact that the ATO does not understand bitcoins and how they might be valued.Because Bitcoin has become much more than just a technology project. There is a definite libertarian ideology bound up with it. Some commentators have suggested it is so toxic that it deserves to ""die in a fire"".Also, Bitcoin's community is currently debating how the currency itself should evolve. Some want it to remain a pure net-connected currency but others, including Craig Wright, want it to become a more general payment system. If Mr Wright was confirmed as Satoshi he could lend weight to one side of the debate.Indeed, he said, during all the years of silence he has not been idle. Instead, he has many ideas about how to expand the reach of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain accounting system."
technology	Bitcoin exchange halts withdrawals after cyber-attack	How Bitcoin worksMutated IDs'Wake-up call'	"Bitstamp - one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges - has halted withdrawals after coming under cyber-attack.The Slovenia-based firm said the culprits had exploited a bug in the virtual currency's underlying software to carry out the assault.It is the second exchange to suspend operations. Tokyo's MtGox took a similar measure on Friday.A third, Bulgaria's BTC-e, has warned that some transactions may be delayed.Like Bitstamp, it cited a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as the cause.The Bitcoin Foundation - a group of developers who maintain and promote the cryptographic code on which the currency relies - said that it was creating workarounds and fixes to tackle the issue.It added that people who had funds stored with the affected exchanges should know that their savings were safe, albeit ""tied up"" for the time being.""This is a denial-of-service attack; whoever is doing this is not stealing coins, but is succeeding in preventing some transactions from confirming,"" wrote Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the foundation.""It's important to note that DoS attacks do not affect people's Bitcoin wallets or funds.""Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins.This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day.To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent.Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.The cause of the problem is an issue called transaction malleability.It involves someone changing the cryptographic code - known as a transaction hash - used to create an ID for the exchange of funds before it is recorded in the blockchain - a database of every transaction carried out in the currency.On Monday, MtGox had suggested that this technique could be used to fool its systems into repeatedly making a payout because it would seem that it had not occurred.The Bitcoin Foundation's initial response was that transaction malleability had been known about since 2011, and that MtGox should have prepared for this when developing its own customised software, which was now proving vulnerable.""This is something that cannot be corrected overnight,"" wrote Mr Andresen.But while other exchanges are not complaining about the risk of making unauthorised payouts, it appears their systems can become overwhelmed if they receive too many ""mutated versions"" of the transaction IDs.""This is a denial-of-service attack made possible by some misunderstandings in Bitcoin wallet implementations,"" said Bitstamp's blog.""These misunderstandings have simple solutions that are being implemented as we speak, and we're confident everything will be back to normal shortly.""The Bitcoin Foundation now says its members and developers from a number of exchanges are working ""collectively and collaboratively"" to tackle the problem and allow withdrawals to resume.One bitcoin is currently trading for about $665 (£402). That is well below the $830 level it was at last Thursday, reflecting investors' concern at the news.However, one expert said the virtual currency should emerge from the attacks more robust than before.""Obviously it's a bit more serious than was initially thought - it was originally believed that it was just a problem at MtGox because of the way they had set up their systems,"" Emily Spaven, editor of the news site Coindesk, told the BBC.""The view from developers is that the exchanges should be processing bitcoin withdrawals again within 48-72 hours, though the wider issue of transaction malleability will take longer to address.""It's been a bit of a wake-up call to get this issue fixed. I suppose they previously thought it wasn't that big a deal."""
technology	Silk Road 2 loses $2.7m in bitcoins in alleged hack	Completely emptyHow Bitcoin worksRun with gold	"The anonymous online marketplace Silk Road 2 says it has been hacked resulting in the loss of all its customers' bitcoins.An administrator for the site said hackers had manipulated computer code enabling them to withdraw $2.7m (£1.6m) worth of the virtual currency.It follows similar attacks on two exchanges that trade in bitcoins earlier in the week.Silk Road 2 is known for selling drugs and other illegal items.The site is only accessible through Tor, a network that allows users to browse anonymously online. The virtual currency Bitcoin is often used in transactions as it also grants users a degree of anonymity.The original Silk Road site was shut down by the FBI in 2013 but those behind it said they would start a new site and shortly afterwards Silk Road 2 appeared online.In a statement posted on Silk Road 2 forums, the administrator of the site, known as Defcon, said: ""We have been hacked.""""Nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.""Our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol known as ""transaction malleability"" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty,"" he said.Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed.

I was slow to respond and too sceptical of the possible issue at hand,"" he said in the forum posting.In an article for CoinDesk, a news site for digital currency, Danny Bradbury an expert on Silk Road, said that bitcoin-based sites should put ""bitcoins under management in cold storage (ie stored offline) so that they could not be stolen by online attackers.""Defcon said that all its customers' bitcoins were being stored online because of planned relaunches of some of the site's features.""In retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and I take full responsibility for this decision.""Despite Defcon denying that he had ""run with the gold"", several Silk Road 2 users questioned whether the operators of the site were involved or covering for people involved.""Does that even sound plausible? Or does it make more sense that they were waiting for the right moment... so that they could retire comfortably,"" wrote aqualung.""Imagine you run this site, you see a huge amount of money sitting right there, and you know that you can take all of it and easily blame it on a hacker,"" wrote cubensis.The site said as a result of the attack it would no longer host ""escrow wallets"" - an account where bitcoins are held until goods ordered are delivered.The chief executive of the company that runs the MtGox bitcoin exchange was confronted by an angry customer at the company's headquarters in Tokyo this week.Kolin Buges, a bitcoin trader from London, said he had travelled to Japan as he was unhappy at MtGox's explanation for its recent problems on the site which prevented customers from making withdrawals.He had 250 bitcoins, worth $155,000 in his MtGox account.""I want to get my bitcoin back, or get MtGox to bring back public confidence that the company is solvent and people's money [is] safe,"" Mr Buges told the Wall Street Journal.One bitcoin is currently trading for around $620, significantly lower than the $830 level it was at before news of the various attacks broke."
technology	Millions of Chinese CVs exposed on cloud server	Breach list	"A database containing resumes of more than 200 million Chinese people has been found exposed online.Security firm Hackenproof said the ""very detailed"" information lacked even the most basic security protections.Names, mobile phone numbers, email addresses, education histories and many other personal details were included in the data trove.Analysis suggested the information was built up by ""scraping"" several Chinese job sites.Writing in a blog, Hackenproof research director Bob Diachenko said he initially thought the data had been taken from large, classified advert site BJ.58.com.However, in a statement given to Hackenproof, BJ.58.com denied it had let the data escape.""We have searched all over the database of us and investigated all the other storage, turned out that the sample data is not leaked from us,"" it said.""It seems that the data is leaked from a third party who scrape data from many CV websites,"" it added.Soon after Mr Diachenko publicised the existence of the data cache via Twitter, it was removed from the Amazon cloud server where it had been stored. Later analysis suggested it had been copied at least 12 times before being deleted.The data loss is the latest in a series that have exposed information about Chinese people.In early January, Beijing police arrested a man who was allegedly stole data on five million rail travellers. The hacker is believed to have targeted the widely used 12306 online rail booking system.In August 2018, Chinese police were reportedly investigating a data breach that involved 500 million records about customers of the Huazhu Group, which operates hotels across the country.The data lost included customer registration information, booking records and personal data.About 19% of Chinese net users had social media and other accounts hacked or lost passwords, reported the Internet Society of China in its 2018 look at online life in the nation.Phishing attacks crafted to look like they come from friends were widely used to catch people out, said the report."
technology	Microsoft pips Amazon for $10bn AI 'Jedi' contract	What is Jedi?Is the decision controversial?A blow for AmazonHow did we get here?What else does the Pentagon say?	"The Pentagon has awarded a $10bn (£8bn) cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, following a heavily scrutinised bidding process in which Amazon had been seen as the favourite.The 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure, or Jedi, is aimed at making the US defence department more technologically agile.Amazon's bid drew criticism from its rivals and US President Donald Trump.The company said it was ""surprised"" by the decision.A ""detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings"" would ""clearly lead to a different conclusion"", it said.Amazon is said to be evaluating its options after the decision. It has 10 days to decide whether or not to launch a challenge.In its statement, the Pentagon said all offers ""were treated fairly"".Microsoft executive Toni Townes-Whitley said the company was ""proud"" to have had its cloud technologies picked by the Department of Defense to ""satisfy the urgent and critical needs of today's warfighters"".The Department of Defense wants to replace its ageing computer networks with a single cloud system.Under the contract, Microsoft will provide artificial intelligence-based analysis and host classified military secrets among other services.It is hoped that Jedi will give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields.Amazon had been considered the front-runner - until President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair.In July he told reporters that he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"".He said other companies had told him that the contract ""wasn't competitively bid"" and that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at the process.Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post newspaper - in the past.Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst Wedbush Securities, said he expected Amazon and others to challenge the decision in the courts, but called it a ""paradigm changer"" for Microsoft.The move was likely to boost Microsoft's share price and bring ""significant positive financial implications"" for the company in the coming years, he said.By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editorAmazon will be bitterly disappointed to have lost this contract, having long considered its bid to be the stronger.But after President Trump's comments about ""receiving tremendous complaints"" about Amazon's frontrunner status in July, and then the delay to announcing the award the following month, it had always looked liked Microsoft could pull off an upset.The timing is curious, however, coming just days after Defence Secretary Mark Esper unexpectedly removed himself from the review process after months of involvement, on the grounds that one of his sons worked for IBM - one of the other original applicants.It means Microsoft is now set to be a huge recipient of Department of Defense funds.Not only will it benefit from Jedi, but also a separate multi-billion dollar contract known as Deos. This has run into delays of its own, but is still set to result in the DoD using cloud-based Office 365 for its email, calendar, video-calling and other productivity software needs.One issue for Microsoft is whether its closeness to the military will cause it problems.Some of its own workers have already objected to it developing a version of its Hololens augmented reality headset for the US military, and the idea of it now providing machine learning tools and other systems to help ""enhance force lethality"" could prove to be a PR nightmare.For Amazon, if the loss of such a lucrative contract is linked to Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, it could fuel calls for AWS to be spun off from its parent and established as a separate company. There had already been speculation this might happen in order to head off regulators' concerns that Amazon already extends too deeply into Americans' lives.The announcement marked the end of a long process that had pitted tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against each other.As the world's biggest provider of cloud-computing services, Amazon had been the favourite to win Jedi. But its competitors argued that the process was unfair.Oracle challenged the bidding process in federal court earlier this year, saying that it was rigged to favour Amazon, but a federal judge dismissed the allegation.It said that it had awarded more than $11bn in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts over the past two years.The Jedi deal ""continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department's needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,"" it added."
technology	CES 2019: Would you upload your house key to the cloud?		"A digital solution for lost house keys has been revealed at the CES tech show.KeyHero will scan and upload a precise image of a key to the cloud for free, but it can only be accessed in one of the firm's partner stores.This image is encrypted and linked to a phone number or email, rather than a home address.If a key is lost, its image can be then recalled via a mobile phone app and recreated in a shop, instead of calling out a locksmith.The firm's current store partners include Home Depot, a DIY chain in the US.All keys have to be scanned in-store to generate the original image.To add an extra layer of security - if a physical key is required, the store staff have to generate a unique seven-digit code to put into the app before the image is unlocked for key cutting.The image can also be shared with anybody who requires access to the property, such as property managers or house sitters, although they will need to show formal identification in order to collect a new key.More from CES 2019:The company says most ""key events"" involve people locking themselves out of their home, rather than losing their keys.Despite the move into a more high-tech solution, KeyHero does not see traditional keys going away any time soon.""If you look at digital locks, most of those locks still use keys as a back-up,"" Michael Rosenblatt, vice-president of product development, says.'We copy about 150 million keys a year, which is an indication that a lot of people use keys.'The KeyHero service will be available in the US."
technology	Children's phone data exposed on cloud server		"The Apple and Android IDs of more than 10,000 children were left unprotected on Amazon cloud servers for months, reports ZDNet.The data was found on one server run by Teensafe, which makes an app parents can use to monitor and control their child's phone use.Also exposed were plaintext passwords, parents' email addresses as well as device names and unique identifiers.The company shut the server down when it was told data was being exposed.""We have taken action to close one of our servers to the public and begun alerting customers that could potentially be impacted,"" Teensafe told ZDNnet.The app maker has not yet responded to a request for a statement from the BBC.The data-exposing server was found by security researcher Robbie Wiggins, who has previously found thousands of similarly misconfigured machines on Amazon Web Services.In this case, he also found another poorly protected Teensafe server which had no important data on it.ZDNet said the servers were left ""unprotected and accessible by anyone without a password"". Data from more than 10,000 accounts was exposed on them.Mr Wiggins told the BBC that the data was viewable because Teensafe had not put in place basic security measures, such as a firewall, to protect data.The scan across AWS that turned up the Teensafe server also found machines run by other companies that had made the same mistakes, he said.Teensafe describes its app, which is available for both iOS and Android, as a way to ""securely"" monitor smartphone use. Once installed, the app lets parents see text messages, numbers being called, websites visited and which apps are installed.The company claims more than one million parents use its service."
technology	'I woke up to thousands of messages from Malaysia'		"London-based artist Laura Melissa Williams woke up one morning last week to find thousands of messages for her on social media - all from Malaysia.Overnight, the thirty-something Briton, who paraglides as a hobby, had accidentally caught the attention of the nation's teenagers.They are in the process of taking SPM exams, roughly the equivalent of GCSEs.And one of the English comprehension questions was about a fictional paraglider called Melissa.The question described the fictional Melissa hitting a storm-cloud - like ""being tossed around in a washing machine"" - and having to be rescued from the roof of a farm by villagers.Following the exam, a student looked up the question on the internet, found Ms Williams (whose middle name is Melissa), realised from her social media she was a paraglider - and the hashtag ""The real Melissa"" was born.""It's a bizarre set of coincidences that created the perfect storm and then went viral,"" Ms Williams told BBC News.It began with a whirlwind of humorous memes about washing machines and farms.""At first, I thought it was funny,"" she said.Some thought Ms Williams was somehow working with the Malaysian government.But as the day wore on, some of the comments became more personal and nastier - along with sarcastic posts about whether ""Melissa"" should have been paragliding in the first place.""I checked with some Malay-speaking friends as I started worrying, I got a bit concerned about any threats - they just said it was mainly immature,"" she said.And then overnight in UK time, Ms Williams found herself the subject of another hashtag: ""Stop cyber-bullying Melissa"".Word had reached Arwind Kumar, a social-media influencer with nearly 200,000 subscribers on YouTube.And he had posted a video about Ms Williams in which he said: ""There is a fine line between making a joke and being extremely rude.""And from then on, Ms Williams said, apologies had flooded in.""I awoke to thousands of messages of apology, from students across Malaysia - some of whom posted nasty comments originally and now regret it and some who apologised on behalf of their cohort,"" she said.She has since received invitations to go to dinner in Malaysia, offers of gifts, and apologies from school teachers, influencers and the media. A female Malaysian paraglider got in touch to ask if they could take a flight together.""For me that's the most amazing thing about this - that the tide turned,"" said Ms Williams, who doesn't currently have plans to visit the country.""You hear stuff in the media about celebrities being bullied and that's the immediate thing that comes to your head, that it's a bunch of 17-year-olds who got carried away, but that's the problem - it's group behaviour, people don't stop and think.""In total, she has now received 210,000 Instagram messages, 30,000 tweets, countless direct messages and she has also acquired 5,000 new followers.""I now have an army of people as my protectors and standing up for what is right and moral,"" she said.Ms Williams is now considering creating an art exhibition based on her experience.Surprisingly, it's not the first time this has happened - the SPM exam in 2018 featured a question about a fictional surfer named Sarah, which propelled Malaysian surfer Sarah Faudzi to Instagram stardom.In September, Malaysia's queen, the Raja Permaisuri Agong, returned to Twitter in order to express disappointment the police were arresting people who had insulted her on social media.""I am truly upset that the police have detained those people. Through the years, my husband and I have never made any police report on bad things said about us,"" she wrote, according to the Straits Times newspaper.The tweet has now been deleted."
technology	Search tool accesses firms' documents in the cloud	Offline 'for maintenance'	"A website created by anonymous hackers has been launched that allows anyone to search for unsecured sensitive data stored in the cloud.Buckhacker is a tool that trawls servers at Amazon Web Services (AWS), a popular cloud computing platform.AWS provides data storage to private firms, governments and universities, among others.Exposed data has been found on it before, but Buckhacker makes searching for it much easier.The name comes from the fact that AWS Simple Storage Servers (S3) are known as ""buckets"" - this is the part of AWS that Buckhacker accesses.The BBC alerted Amazon to Buckhacker shortly after it went live, but the firm has yet to issue a statement on the matter.On Wednesday afternoon, Buckhacker went offline ""for maintenance"", though it had previously been working allowing a number of cyber-security experts to explore it.""We went online with the alpha version [too] early,"" said a Twitter account associated with the Buckhacker site.Security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC: ""It's a goldmine of stuff which shouldn't be public.""He pointed to one example that appeared to be of encryption keys for a cloud customer at a different cloud computing service.""S3 buckets have been a problem for years,"" added Mr Beaumont.""The search engine is the first easy to access ways of looking inside them... companies are losing control of their data in the cloud."""
technology	Exposed Amazon cloud storage clients get tip-off alerts	Varied alertsWhat is cloud storage?Lost bucketsBasic service	"Security researchers have posted ""friendly warnings"" to users of Amazon's cloud data storage service whose private content has been made public, the BBC has learned.The BBC found almost 50 warnings posted to the firm's servers. Many had more than one warning uploaded to them.The messages urged owners to secure their information before it was stolen by malicious hackers.There was a rash of data breaches involving Amazon Web Services in 2017.Misconfigured settings by users were repeatedly blamed.Although Amazon is best known for its online shopping service, its AWS division serves many of the world's biggest businesses as well as governments and other public bodies.The messages discovered on the US firm's data stores varied.Some just told the owners that their settings exposed data and others were more explicit in their warnings about what could happen.One said: ""Please fix this before a bad guys finds it.""The BBC passed its list of sites that had received warning messages to Amazon as week ago, so it could contact the customers and suggest they review their settings.In essence, these machines act like the hard drive on your desktop computer and can hold almost any type of data or file.Organisations use these cloud-based stores for all kinds of tasks. Some use them to hold images, documents and other files that populate their websites. Others use them as repositories for detailed data that is mined or analysed to help other bits of their business.They are also popular because sometimes they can be set up using only a credit card - much more quickly than would be possible via a company's internal admin systems.Security researcher Robbie Wiggins, who regularly seeks out insecure cloud systems, said he had received a range of reactions when telling an organisation that their data was wide open.""I've had a few responses ranging from monetary rewards to thanks,"" he told the BBC. ""I've struggled with a good few, especially the government for Argentina.""Often companies made it difficult to report problems because no contact details were available for security teams or server administrators.Mr Wiggins said he currently had a list of about 2,000 insecure data stores, also known as buckets, about which he was steadily informing affected organisations.""Lots of buckets appear to been abandoned and forgotten about,"" said Mr Wiggins.The main target of the security experts scanning for mistakes are servers supporting Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) - part of its AWS business.Over the last 18 months, Uber, Verizon, Alteryx, the WWE, US defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Dow Jones and three data mining companies have exposed data via misconfigured S3 buckets. Between them the firms lost data covering the digital identities of hundreds of millions of people.Robin Wood, who wrote a bucket-scanning tool that many researchers use, said the ease with which the storage can be bought and configured made them very attractive to a lot of companies.They were particularly useful for short-term projects that had to be set up and run quickly.Often, said Mr Wood, the buckets set up for a particular short-term project were mothballed once the venture was finished. As time went by the software on these abandoned sites became easier to successfully attack because it was no longer updated with patches for known bugs.""It's amazing how many larger firms have a website or web hosting package that the security and IT teams know nothing about,"" he told the BBC.Other stores were left open to get around configuration problems that can crop up when several different firms work on the same project, he said.""What tends to happen is that if something is not working properly they will open it up a bit to see if that fixes it,"" said Mr Wood. ""They just keep clicking until it works.""Anyone coming across the data might be able to scoop up valuable information, such as database files and login data, that could help them gain access to other networks of the same company, he said.Scanning for vulnerable buckets was straightforward because of the way Amazon organised its service, he added.A spokeswoman for Amazon said the default configuration settings on its S3 service kept data private. She said it had created several tools to make it easier for S3 customers to secure data or work out who could access it.For instance, she said, the main management screen that customers use to manage buckets used a ""traffic light"" system to show which were open to public view and which were more tightly controlled.And, she added, just because buckets were public did not mean they were wrongly configured. Many large organisations, such as Nasa and the Open Street Map project, made huge amounts of information available to spur collaboration, she said.Despite this help many firms still got cloud security wrong, said James Hatch, director of applied intelligence at BAE Cyber Services.This was partly because firms did not appreciate what they were buying when they signed up for an online data storage service such as S3.Many people regarded cloud services as being akin to a hotel, in that they relied on the organisation to provide the working infrastructure that they then used, he told the BBC.Instead, he said, the service they got was much more basic.""When you are using pure infrastructure cloud services it's one step away from that. The starting point is more like an empty plot of land,"" said Mr Hatch. ""They might give you the right building blocks to get the security right, but it's up to you to do it."""
technology	Classified Pentagon data leaked on the public cloud	Sensitive details leaked	"Classified Pentagon data was mistakenly left exposed on an unsecured public cloud server, cyber-security researchers have discovered.The 100GB of data is from a failed joint intelligence-sharing programme run by the US Army and National Security Agency in 2013.The information was left on an unlisted but public Amazon Web Services storage server.It is likely to have been accessible to anyone on the internet for years.The exposed data was discovered by cyber-security company UpGuard on 27 September.A virtual-disk snapshot of a computer hard drive was found in an Amazon Web Services S3 cloud-storage account configured for public access.The hard drive had been part of a failed cloud-based intelligence-sharing platform developed by Inscom, the US Army's Intelligence and Security Command, in May 2013.The files include sensitive details about the US Department of Defense's battlefield-intelligence system, its cloud-based intelligence-gathering platform, Red Disk, and a virtual drive for receiving and transmitting classified data.The files also contain private keys and hashed passwords, which could be used to access other internal systems at the Pentagon, if the passwords are still valid and the hash is cracked.""Plainly put, the digital tools needed to potentially access the networks relied upon by multiple Pentagon intelligence agencies to disseminate information should not be something available to anybody entering a URL into a web browser,"" UpGuard's cyber-resilience analyst, Dan O'Sullivan, wrote in a blog post.""Regrettably, this cloud leak was entirely avoidable, the likely result of process errors within an IT environment that lacked the procedures needed to ensure something as impactful as a data repository containing classified information not be left publicly accessible.""The information has now been secured.The NSA referred all media requests to Inscom, which has been contacted by the BBC for comment."
technology	Google announces London cloud computing data centre	'Lower latency''Deep discounts'Apple's China data centre	"Google has revealed it has built a London data centre for the cloud computing services it rents to third parties.The facility is its second in Europe, after Brussels, and promises to provide faster access times to nearby clients.Google is currently the third most capable cloud computing service provider, according to a recent study.But the report, by Gartner, suggested Amazon and Microsoft had a clear lead.The technology consultancy added that in terms of sales to the ""cloud infrastructure as a service"" market, Google's share was also a ""distant third"".Until now, the search giant has focused on opening data centres for its cloud computing platform in the US and Asia, where it has bases in Singapore, Taiwan and Tokyo.But in announcing the London centre, it also disclosed plans to open facilities in Finland, the Netherlands and Frankfurt.""GCP [Google Cloud Platform] customers throughout the British Isles and Western Europe will see significant reductions in latency when they run their workloads in the London region,"" said product manager Dave Stiver, referring to processing delays caused by the distances data has to travel.""In cities like London, Dublin, Edinburgh and Amsterdam, our performance testing shows 40% to 82% reductions in round-trip latency when serving customers from London compared with the Belgium region.""A spokeswoman for the company added that the decision to build a London centre had been taken before the Brexit vote and was therefore unrelated to speculation that the UK's data privacy laws may diverge from the EU's in the future.Google's platform allows clients to offload data processing tasks and information storage, including support for apps they may offer to the public and analysing feedback gathered from internet-connected devices.By charging customers for the amount of compute time they use rather than a flat rate, Google seeks to provide IT departments with a cheaper alternative to maintaining their own data centres.The company's existing customers include the Telegraph newspaper, Coca-Cola and the online education service Khan Academy.At present, GCP offers fewer features than Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, but it is catching up, according to Gartner.""Google uses deep discounts and exceptionally flexible contracts to try to win projects from customers that are currently spending significant sums of money with cloud competitors,"" its June report said.And that had led some companies to use Google to supplement their use of Amazon or Microsoft's rival platforms.Gartner added: ""GCP is increasingly chosen as a strategic alternative to AWS by customers whose businesses compete with Amazon.""Last month it emerged that Wal-Mart had urged its IT vendors not to use Amazon's service because it did not want its ""most sensitive data... sitting on a competitor's platform"".Google does not disclose revenue for its cloud platform, but analysts estimate that it generated about $1bn (£776m) of sales last year and forecast it will double that amount in 2018.By contrast, market leader AWS generated $12.2bn of sales in the past financial year, and is more profitable than Amazon's better-known retail business.Microsoft will update investors on Azure's performance when it posts its full year's results next week.On Monday, it announced a new hybrid service that would allow customers to run Azure's technologies on their own servers.Azure Stack is being targeted at operations that have slow or non-existent internet connections - such as oil rigs and ships - as well as countries where data must be stored locally.In a related development, Apple has announced it is setting up its first data centre in China.The facility is being developed in conjunction with a local company - Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry - and will be used to deliver its iCloud services to the public.""This data centre will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,"" Apple said in a statement.""No backdoors will be created into any of our systems.""China introduced a law in June that requires overseas-based companies to both store data about its citizens locally and to give Chinese companies control over the operation of the computer servers involved.Apple has said it will retain the relevant encryption keys and has indicated the move will not compromise users' privacy.But some experts have suggested it could put the company under more pressure to acquiesce to government demands in the case of future disputes."
technology	Amazon accuses Walmart of bullying in cloud computing clash		"Walmart, the US's biggest retail chain, has been accused of trying to coerce its technology suppliers into shunning Amazon's cloud computing service.Amazon has accused its rival of attempting to ""bully"" the IT companies into picking a rival platform.The row follows a report by the Wall Street Journal, which said other unnamed large retailers had also asked vendors to shun Amazon Web Services.The row comes at a time Amazon is expanding its shopping operations.Last Friday, the Seattle-based business announced a $13.7bn (£10.8bn) takeover of the groceries chain Whole Foods.And this week it revealed it had struck a deal with Nike to sell the sportswear-maker's shoes directly, and that it was launching Prime Wardrobe - a service that lets customers order and try clothes for seven days before deciding which to buy and keep.Amazon's Web Services division may not be as well known to the public as the company's retail operations, but it is a huge money-earner.In April, the company reported the unit had generated $3.7bn in sales over the previous three months.The business provides computing power, online storage, security protection and developer tools to third parties.Its clients include Netflix, Airbnb, General Electric and the CIA.According to market research company Gartner, AWS leads the market in its field.However, Walmart uses Microsoft's rival Azure service.A spokesman for Walmart acknowledged it had concerns about its suppliers' use of AWS.""Our vendors have the choice of using any cloud provider that meets their needs and their customers' needs,"" he said.""It shouldn't be a big surprise that there are cases in which we'd prefer our most sensitive data isn't sitting on a competitor's platform.""Amazon suggested this approach was misguided.""We've heard that Walmart continues to try to bully their suppliers into not using AWS because they have an incorrect view that AWS is somehow supporting Amazon's retail business,"" said a spokesman.""Plenty of suppliers are standing up to Walmart and refusing to be told that they can't use [us].""Tactics like this are bad for business and customers and rarely carry the day.""AWS's use of encryption means that its own staff cannot peer into the data stored on its computer servers by its customers.But one analyst said it was still understandable Walmart and others might not want to help send business its way.""AWS is a separate part of Amazon's business, but ultimately this comes back to being frightened of being disrupted, especially in light of the recent acquisition of Whole Foods,"" said Nick McQuire, from the consultancy CCS Insight.""The question is whether this fear now will cause a wider backlash among retailers, where you get many within the community switching from using AWS in the cloud to Google, Microsoft or someone else."""

Customers are asked to punch their card details into a secure automated system. If a customer attempts to give their card information verbally, they are stopped by the agent.""It added: ""Once the matter was brought to our attention, we immediately secured the files in question. We have contacted the Information Commissioner's Office.""The calls ranged from a few minutes to up to an hour and involved discussion of holiday details. In some heard by Verdict people begin to say their card number.When firms take credit card numbers, whether spoken or tapped into a phone, they are obliged to mute this section of the call.Security consultant Graham Cluley said: ""Most consumers accept that recordings may be kept for 'training purposes', but you also expect them to be stored securely and certainly not left lying around in an internet-connected bucket where any Tom, Dick or Harry could access them with malicious intent.""Things are made even more serious by the fact that some of these records had transcriptions, making it even easier for a criminal to scour through the database to access information that they could monetise with fraudulent intent."""
technology	Amazon's Jeff Bezos promises climate-change action	Promises	"Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has promised to make the company carbon neutral and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement by 2040.More than 1,500 Amazon employees have pledged to stage a ""walkout"" protest against the company's environmental record, on Friday.It will be the first walkout by staff at Amazon's Seattle headquarters.Organisers have welcomed Mr Bezos's promise but say it does not go far enough.Mr Bezos said he hoped to make the company carbon neutral 10 years earlier than expected.At a press conference in Washington DC, he announced the launch of a climate pledge any company can sign up to.Its aim is to meet the targets set out in the Paris agreement by 2040, 10 years earlier than specified.Greenpeace welcomed the announcement but said Amazon needed to end its use of fossil fuels.""If Jeff Bezos wants Amazon to be a leader on climate, he needs to spell out exactly how it is going to rapidly move the company off of fossil fuels to keep our planet within the 1.5 degree temperature threshold in the Paris Agreement that Amazon has now committed to,"" the organisation said.""Throwing money at carbon offsets and continuing to support the oil giants find even more oil is an early indication that Jeff Bezos doesn't understand the transition that is needed.""To meet its pledge, Amazon said it had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles to reduce its fuel consumption. The first will enter service in 2021.As well as its online shopping and delivery operations, Amazon operates vast data centres and cloud computing services.According to the International Energy Agency, data centres were responsible for about 1% of the world's electricity use in 2018. And demand for cloud computing is expected to increase.Mr Bezos said 40% of the energy Amazon used was currently from renewable sources but this would rise to 100% by 2030.Amazon will also invest $100m (£80m) to restore forests and wetlands.The company will also measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly.""We want to use our scope and our scale to lead the way,"" said Mr Bezos in a press statement.In June 2017, the Trump administration said the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.But Amazon said it would meet the targets set out in the agreement 10 years ""ahead of schedule"".In July, thousands of Amazon workers staged protests about pay and working conditions at the online retail giant.The disruption was timed to coincide with Prime Day, when Amazon offers discounts and promotions."
technology	Microsoft's UK data centres power up cloud services	'Secure data'Public sector targets	"Microsoft has announced that its first UK cloud computing data centres are up and running.The facilities are located in London, Durham and Cardiff. They should help the US company sell its online services to the public sector and other bodies that handle sensitive data.The Ministry of Defence and an NHS trust are among those set to adopt the internet-powered products as a result.Amazon is set to open its own rival UK data centres soon.Mike Stone, chief information officer at the Ministry of Defence, said he first approached Microsoft with the idea of opening local facilities two years ago.At the time, he said, the MoD was using software that had not been updated in years.""We were still on Windows XP, for instance, and all of the applications were from 2003 or prior to that,"" he told the BBC.""I took the view that the services we were providing were unfit for purpose. The idea is to provide a different capability that fully exploits the power of the cloud and mobility.""We can now work on documents collaboratively and understand more about the ways we are working - we will be able to see how much time teams are spending in meetings, on email and on the phone.""Microsoft first revealed its plan to set up UK-based data centres last November.They now provide a local version of its Azure services, which allow customers to store data and offload processing tasks.Clients are only charged for what they use and can easily alter their requirements at short notice. This can prove substantially cheaper than maintaining their own computer servers, although a hybrid approach is also possible. The risk, however, is that if something goes wrong it can cause problems for many organisations at once.The UK data centres also mean Microsoft is able to offer its online suite of Office 365 productivity apps without sending data overseas.It hopes this will reassure clients that their information is secure.Microsoft is, however, fighting a long-running legal battle against the US government, which believes it has the right to force domestic companies to surrender data even when it is held overseas.""The MoD had always considered itself as a special case with bespoke and disparate ICT [information and communications technology] solutions, but is now having to be far more commercially minded in the face of financial pressures,"" said Daniel Jones, an analyst at the consultancy Kable.""Other areas of the public sector have also held off migration to the cloud for various reasons, including fears over data sovereignty and the complexity of the task.""But no-one has a more complex environment than the MoD's ICT network, so that should provide a degree of reassurance to other potential customers.""To start with, the MoD's 230,000 staff will not be allowed to store ""classified"" documents on Azure, but Mr Stone said this restriction might be relaxed over time.""Even though legally, we can keep all of our data anywhere in the European Union, when it came to defence information, it did not feel right to me that it was stored outside the UK,"" he added.""That's why I asked [Microsoft's chief executive] Satya Nadella to come.""In addition to the MoD, other new clients include:""We're expecting that legal services, banking, utilities and some of those more regulated sectors as well as the public sectors will now find ways to benefit from the cloud,"" said Microsoft UK's general manager of marketing Nicola Hodson.Amazon does not offer an equivalent to Office 365, but its AWS cloud computing division remains more popular than Azure.AWS accounted for about 31% of the global cloud infrastructure service market between April and June, according to Synergy Research.In contrast, Microsoft had an 11% share.Amazon also announced plans to build UK data centres last year, but is yet to confirm when they will open."
technology	Fury after Adobe Creative Cloud deletes files	Alphabetical order	"Adobe has patched its Creative Cloud apps after people noticed the software was deleting Mac users' files without warning.After customers updated Creative Cloud, it accessed their hard drive and deleted the first folder that appeared in alphabetical order.Due to file-naming conventions on Mac computers, the bug often deleted hidden system folders or data backup files.Adobe issued a fix for the issue on Sunday.Many people in the creative industries have reacted angrily on social media.""So Creative Cloud is what screwed up my Backblaze backups. Thanks, Adobe,"" said college instructor JJ Litke.""I think Adobe owes us an explanation, and owes Backblaze a public apology. This bug is disturbing and terrifying,"" tweeted Funjon.""Great news that fix is out but very disappointed Adobe haven't been very transparent or apologetic about the issue,"" said another user.The problem came to light on Thursday after Backblaze, which makes data backup software, started receiving hundreds of support requests from its customers.The firm's software detected that some of the files it uses to perform its duties had been deleted, and staff discovered that Creative Cloud was responsible after a designer installed Adobe's update.The issue was present in Creative Cloud version 3.5.0.206 on a Mac.""We kept testing and realised that this was occurring upon 'sign-in' to Creative Cloud,"" Backblaze said on its blog.The company later identified the Creative Cloud bug was deleting the first folder that appeared on the hard drive in alphabetical order.On a Mac, hidden files and folders are prefixed with ""."" which the operating system places before A in alphabetical order.The flaw interfered with Backblaze's software by chance because the backup software places a hidden folder called "".bzvol"" on the hard drives it indexes, which happened to be top of the list.On machines without the backup software installed, a different folder may have been deleted instead.""As someone affected by this bug I am pretty annoyed. Materially it hasn't (yet) cost me any work, but it's a huge violation of trust,"" said one user on Reddit.In a statement, Adobe said: ""On the 12 Feb we were notified that some customers had an issue with an update to the Creative Cloud Desktop application.""We removed the update from distribution and deployed a new one which addresses the issue."""
technology	Microsoft pledges ‘cloud computing for public good'	Tough crowd	"Computing giant Microsoft has pledged to provide $1bn-worth (£700m) of cloud computing resources to organisations it deems to be working for the ""public good"".The resources will be shared out over the next three years to about 70,000 non-profits and 900 university research projects.In simplest terms, cloud computing is the term given to storing data on the internet, rather than on a local computer.As well as making data more easily accessible, the added promise for non-profits is that the resources will provide vast amounts of computing power that would ordinarily be out of reach for all but the biggest businesses.In a blog post explaining the initiative, Microsoft's chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote: ""Cloud services can unlock the secrets held by data in ways that create new insights and lead to breakthroughs, not just for science and technology, but for addressing the full range of economic and social challenges and the delivery of better human services.""The crunching of so-called ""big data"" is seen as a major opportunity for non-profits dealing in social issues that pose a cumbersome problem without the kind of processing power cloud computing can provide.In that respect, Microsoft's pledge isn't for a tangible product, or cash, but instead access to servers and services that normal businesses would need to pay considerable fees for.The money will also be spent on improving ""last mile"" internet connectivity - the hope is countries that are under connected will begin to enjoy some of the luxuries more developed internet nations have - such as broadband at home.Other companies, particularly Facebook, have pursued similar goals.Facebook's Internet.org project is investing in connectivity technologies - such as drones - to fill that last mile, helping what founder Mark Zuckerberg refers to as the ""next billion"" people to access the web.However, initiatives such as this aren't always so well received. Facebook's Free Basics scheme, in which certain mobile sites were accessible for free, has caused uproar in India, where local businesses say Facebook is giving itself an unfair advantage over local competitors.Microsoft will invariably be hit with the same accusation - that a donation over three years will be made in the hope that organisations will become ingrained in the Microsoft cloud ecosystem for many more years to come.That said, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has gained considerable applause for his continually expressed desire to use Microsoft's immense size and wealth in developing countries, including his native India.As well as being a guest of Michelle Obama at the recent State of the Union address, the 48-year-old is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, seeking to stress Microsoft's potential to provide computing power for initiatives beyond big business.In a blog post published on Wednesday, he wrote: ""If cloud computing is one of the most important transformations of our time, how do we ensure that its benefits are universally accessible?""What if only wealthy societies have access to the data, intelligence, analytics and insights that come from the power of mobile and cloud computing?""Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook"

No decision will be made on the programme until he has completed his examination.""Dr Esper was previously the US Secretary of the Army, so would have been familiar with the Jedi contract before taking on the new role.The DoD had previously signalled that it might also consider Google as a third alternative.But the search giant dropped out of the process in October, saying that it ""couldn't be assured that [the work] would align with our AI principles"".Neither Amazon nor Microsoft has commented.As the world's biggest provider of cloud-computing services, Amazon had been the favourite to win Jedi.The company's Amazon Web Services division secured a contract with the CIA in 2013 to allow the spy agency to offload work to its computer servers.That success helped it gain other public-sector work and it now says that more than 2,000 government agencies use its cloud technologies.Microsoft's Azure division also provides cloud services to the US intelligence community, and it is the favourite to win a second Pentagon cloud-computing contract out for tender.The Defense Enterprise Office Solutions (Deos) contract involves providing email, calendar, video-calling and other productivity tools to the US military and is expected to be worth about $8bn.There had been speculation that the DoD might not want to award both Deos and Jedi to the same provider to avoid becoming over-reliant on a single company.President Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its chief, Jeff Bezos, in the past.Mr Bezos has acknowledged that his ownership of the Washington Post - which is often critical of the current administration - has been a ""complexifier"", but has said that the president is wrong to consider him an ""enemy"".Mr Bezos has, however, been clear that he believes Amazon should provide services to the US authorities, even if its causes controversy.This has included supplying facial-recognition technologies to the police as well as pursuing the Jedi contract.""If big tech companies are going to turn their back on US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble,"" Mr Bezos told a conference in October 2018, following Google's pull-out.One factor that could act in Mr Bezos's favour is that he has resisted pressure from some of Amazon's own employees to drop the surveillance software firm Palantir as a client of Amazon Web Services because of its reported links to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Palantir's co-founder is Peter Thiel - a billionaire tech investor who advises President Trump.Mr Thiel has previously complimented both Mr Bezos and Amazon's impact on the wider tech sector in public comments.However, his view on Jedi is unknown.Bloomberg reported last month that Mr Thiel met Mr Trump and Oracle's co-chief executive, Safra Catz, at the White House last year when Oracle was still seen as a contender.The news agency said the possibility of Amazon winning the Jedi contract was one topic discussed, but did not report the detail of what was said.A a spokeswoman for Oracle told the BBC: ""Thank you for reaching out. We decline comment."""
technology	A cloud of uncertainty		"Two days after stolen celebrity photos started leaking onto the 4Chan website, one thing is clear. And that is that virtually nothing is clear.Despite all the speculation about Apple's iCloud or other cloud services being hacked, there is still no evidence about exactly how the photos were obtained.All we know is that some - but not all - of the photos are genuine, and that they have now been spread widely across the web, with some individuals trying to turn a quick profit by offering access in exchange for payment in Bitcoin. At least one of these people has been ""identified"" as the leaker, but has insisted he was just trying to make a quick buck rather than being the original source.Apple has not exactly sprung from the starting gate to deal with what are worrying questions about its security. They finally released a statement last night saying ""We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report"".Meanwhile my inbox has filled up with emails from PR people offering ""security experts"" to comment on the ""iCloud hack"". When I challenge them on how they know it was an iCloud hack, they explain that they read this in the media. So much for expertise.One expert, though, was prepared to give a sober analysis of what might have happened without jumping to instant conclusions. Rik Ferguson of Trend Micro told me that as this was a targeted attack on the photos - rather than any other documents - of a distinct group of people, this was unlikely to be a widescale assault on Apple's infrastructure.Yesterday he came up with a number possible methods used by the hackers - from a phishing attack, to the hacker breaking into another connected account with weaker security. He said that the least likely explanation was that all the celebrities had weak passwords allowing the hacker simply to guess them and log in.This morning he says that possibility has now moved to the top of his list after news emerged of a potential vulnerability in Apple's systems which would have allowed a so-called brute force attack. This involves bombarding a log-in page with thousands of potential passwords until one works out - and is usually rendered ineffective by that message informing a user their account has been locked after three unsuccessful attempts.Now it seems that hole has been patched - but it might have been behind the celebrity hack. Or, as Rik Ferguson, admits, this might be a case of correlation not equalling causation. We now need to hear from Apple on whether its engineers think that theory holds water.The other key question that needs answering, says Ferguson, is how the hackers obtained the email addresses they would have needed to gain access to the victims' accounts. It seems unlikely that they would have got them all in a hurry, making it perhaps more likely that this material has been collected over a long period, perhaps by a group of hackers, and then released all in one go.For the moment though we are all wandering around in clouds of uncertainty. But one thing is pretty obvious - putting photos online that you do not want the world to see may not be a very safe thing to do."
technology	FBI investigates 'Cloud' celebrity picture leaks		"The FBI is looking into allegations that intimate pictures of celebrities have been stolen and posted online.About 20 personalities, including the US actress Jennifer Lawrence, have had images of themselves leaked over the Internet.It is understood some of the images were obtained from services such as Apple iCloud that back up content from devices on to the internet.Apple says it is investigating whether iCloud accounts have been hacked.Ms Lawrence, who stars in The Hunger Games films, has requested an investigation after a hacker apparently obtained photographs, with graphic content, from the mobile phones of numerous celebrities.A spokeswoman for the actress said the internet posts were ""a flagrant violation of privacy"".An FBI spokesman told the Associated Press news agency that it was ""aware of the allegations"" and was ""addressing the matter"".Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris was quoted by Reuters as saying in an email: ""We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report.""Experts have raised concerns over the security of ""cloud"" storage sites.""It is important for celebrities and the general public to remember that images and data no longer just reside on the device that captured it,"" said Ken Westin, security analyst at Tripwire.""Although many cloud providers may encrypt the data communications between the device and the cloud, it does not mean that the image and data is encrypted when the data is at rest.""If you can view the image in the cloud service, so can a hacker.""'Creepy effort'Images of the celebrities were leaked on image posting website 4Chan.The user posting them - who defined him or herself as a ""collector"" rather than ""hacker"" - said more images of different celebrities would soon be posted.Copies of the images spread to other services, including Reddit, Imgur and Twitter, from which they were subsequently deleted by administrators.While some of the celebrities said the images were fake, others have confirmed their authenticity.Actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead posted on Twitter: ""To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves.""Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this.""Winstead's comments would suggest iCloud was not at play, as pictures on Apple's service are only viewable online for 30 days.Raj Samani from Intel Security said: ""Almost every service used online requires a password, and to ensure your passwords are secure, they must be complex.""But more often than not, it is human weaknesses that give hackers the simplest route to compromising accounts.""Phishing"" people - meaning to trick them into giving up their password - is considered perhaps the simplest and most targeted way hackers gain access to accounts."
technology	Apple's services disrupted for some		"Apple has confirmed its app stores and music and radio services are disrupted.Users in the UK were among those affected by the ""outage"", which began at about 13:00 on Tuesday.On website Downdetector, which monitors internet issues, users from as far afield as Australia, the US, Vietnam and Qatar were also reporting issues.Apple's System Status page says: ""We are investigating and will update the status as more information becomes available.""According to Apple news site 9to5Mac, the red triangle denoting outage is almost never seen on its status page.""Using the red triangle is indicative of a very significant problem,"" it said.The problems come just after the trial versions of iOS 13 and macOS Catalina were made available to developers and days after Google Cloud services were affected by a major blackout, which brought down numerous websites and services.That problem also affected many of Apple's iCloud products, including iMessage and photos.Apple uses Google Cloud as the backbone for some of its products."
technology	Facebook encryption threatens public safety, say ministers	Privacy and safetyWire taps	"UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and counterparts in the US and Australia have sent an open letter to Facebook calling on it to rethink its plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms.The policy threatens ""lives and the safety of our children"", they said.They said it could hamper international efforts to grant law enforcers faster access to private messages on social media, as agreed between the UK and US.Facebook said ""people have the right to have a private conversation online.""The head of Facebook-owned WhatsApp Will Cathcart had previously posted on Hacker News: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day.""Facebook said it is ""consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology"" to keep people safe.The letter was signed by Ms Patel, the US Attorney General William P Barr, Acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and the Australian minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton. It comes off the back of a data access agreement between the US and the UK designed to remove the barriers to cross-border surveillance.It allows British law-enforcement agencies to demand from US tech firms data relating to terrorists, child-sexual abusers and other serious criminals.It is hoped it will dramatically speed up investigations - previously, the process of requesting data from US firms could take anything from six months to two years.Under the new agreement that could be cut to a matter of weeks or even days.But there is one major problem - messages sent over services using end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, will remain unreadable.Following scandals over the misuse of personal data, the social network has focused on privacy and it now offers encryption as an option to users on its Messenger service.It also has plans to introduce it to Instagram.""Tech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public,"" the letter read.It added: ""So far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms.""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook's more than two billion users, it's time he let us know what it is.""In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which the National Crime Agency estimates have led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe.Head of online child safety at the NSPCC Tony Stower said: ""It's an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected.""The landmark agreement between the US and UK on accessing data will radically reduce the time it takes for police to get hold of the data they need from tech giants to bring offenders to justice.""It should be a hugely important step forward in tackling online child abuse - if tech giants play their part too.""There has been some confusion about whether the Cloud Act could force firms such as Facebook to offer so-called back doors to law enforcement.In a series of tweets on the issue, Facebook's ex-technology officer Alex Stamos attempted to clarify.""This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it does not grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,"" he wrote.""Orders for wire taps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.""A BBC investigation earlier this year found that encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals."
technology	Pixel 4 seeks to reclaim low-light photography crown for Google	Pixel is popular in USStar gazingMiniature radar	"Google is pitching its Pixel 4 phones as being able to take the kind of astrophotography images that required specialist camera kit in the past.They are also the first handsets to use a motion-sensing radar chip that switches off some functionality when the phone is left unattended, saving battery life.Pixel is only the ninth bestselling phone brand in the UK, despite positive reviews for its last-generation models.Google says it is playing a long game.""It is very early for us still,"" devices and services chief Rick Osterloh told BBC News ahead of its New York launch.""Most people in the mobile-phone space... take more than a decade to grow to any significant scale. And so, we have that long-term view.""But UK sales fell post-Pixel 3 launchOne reason the Pixel 3 has been more successful in the US than elsewhere is that Huawei has been effectively excluded from the American market.And with the Chinese company's latest models unable to pre-install Google apps because of a trade ban, one market watcher said Pixel had a chance to make significant gains this time round.""Operators and retailers in Europe are nervous about a return to there being just two dominant players - Samsung and Apple,"" said Ben Wood, from CCS Insight.""With Huawei effectively leaving the market, clearly there's an opportunity for Google if it is prepared to put significant marketing support behind its devices.""The Pixel 4 and larger Pixel 4 XL seek to build on their predecessors' widely praised Night Sight facility, after reviews suggested it had finally been surpassed by the iPhone 11 and Huawei Mate 30's low-light capabilities.First, Google says, its machine-learning algorithms have been improved to deliver better ""colour balance"", to ensure skies and other parts of the scenery look more natural.This should address the fact some critics felt the old software sometimes whitened warm sources of light too aggressively.Secondly, a new Astrophotography mode allows the phone to capture ""stars, planets and even galaxies"" by automatically creating a composite of 15 long-exposure images, each lasting 15 seconds in duration. The whole process can take more than four minutes to complete.Daylight shots also benefit from the introduction of a ""dual exposure"" feature. This allows owners to set a different exposure setting for the brightness and shadows via on-screen sliders, and preview the results in real-time.Google says this offers benefits over the earlier HDR (high dynamic range) mode, where the effect was applied automatically and users could not see the results until after a photograph was taken. It means, for example, a user can set one exposure for the sky and another for the subjects in the foreground to compose the desired stylistic effect.For the first time, the Pixel 4 also features two cameras on the backThe added telephoto lens should help the handset take flattering portrait shots and a better zoom effect. But it risks undermining Google's earlier claim its machine-learning software had negated the need for added hardware.""People are going to see the value in the numbers,"" said Jonathan Bray, from the Expert Reviews website, referring to the iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10's three rear cameras.""And how many people are actually going to use the Astrophotography thing? I'm not sure many.""Pixel is still really a geek thing rather than mass market.""The Pixel 4 is also noteworthy for doing away with the ""notch"" in the Pixel 3's display, opting instead for a bezel that runs across the whole top of the screen.This makes room for several new face-unlock components, which Google says brings its handsets in line with Apple's in the security stakes.In addition, a Soli radar chip makes its debut after five years' development in the US company's labs.This is used to give the device a 180-degree sense of motion in its immediate environment, allowing it to:Mr Bray suggested the features, while technically impressive, were unlikely to have mass appeal.But Google's hardware chief indicated they were just the start.""We think it's a great foundation to build more and more capabilities,"" said Mr Osterloh.""It really supports this idea of ambient computing, where the technology just sort of fades in the background and you can interact more naturally with it.""The 5.7in handset will cost £669 and the 6.3in model will be £829 when they go on sale on October 24, representing lower price points than the Pixel 3 at launch.Other new products unveiled by Google included:The firm also announced its Stadia cloud gaming service would launch on November 19."
technology	Capital One accused 'breached 30 other organisations'	Legal challenges	"A software developer accused of stealing data from finance company Capital One took files from over 30 other organisations, prosecutors claim.The alleged thief, Paige Thompson, was arrested after reportedly talking online about taking Capital One data.In court papers, the US Department of Justice claimed Paige Thompson had ""terabytes"" of data in her possession.It said she had ""intruded"" into servers belonging to companies, schools and government agencies.Further charges against Ms Thompson could result from the evidence gathered during a search of her home, it said.The FBI was working to identify all those who had had data taken so it could alert them to the suspected theft.And investigators were also looking at the types of information allegedly taken.The DoJ said there was no evidence yet that Ms Thompson had tried to sell the data she had allegedly taken from Capital One.Ms Thompson is a former employee of Amazon and is alleged to have taken data from cloud servers it runs.The Capital One data breach involved personal information about more than 106 million of its customers.Data taken included names, addresses and phone numbers of customers who had applied for credit cards and other financial services.Capital One said no credit card information was taken in the breach.The legal document added the theft had left Capital One facing more than 40 cases of legal action in the US and eight in Canada.The DoJ filed its court papers in a bid to ensure Ms Thompson stays in prison until the trial centring on the Capital One data breach begins.It claimed she had a history of mental illness and threatening behaviour that led to her being a ""flight risk"".A hearing about the case is scheduled to take place on 15 August."
technology	Unmanned ship to go on 400-year-old journey across the Atlantic	Pilgrim journeySleek designThe Mayflower Autonomous ShipTimelineData collectionMicroplasticsInsurance	"A fully autonomous ship tracing the journey of the Mayflower is being built by a UK-based team, with help from tech firm IBM.The Mayflower Autonomous Ship, or MAS, will launch from Plymouth in the UK in September 2020.Its voyage will mark the 400th anniversary of the pilgrim ship which brought European settlers to America in 1620.IBM is providing artificial intelligence systems for the ship.The vessel will make its own decisions on its course and collision avoidance, and will even make expensive satellite phone calls back to base if it deems it necessary.The sensor technology guiding its decision-making process includes:Data on hundreds of ships has already been collected in Plymouth Sound to feed its machine-learning algorithms.400 years ago, on 6 September 1620, the Mayflower set sail from Plymouth to Massachusetts, with 102 passengers and around 30 crew members.The original journey took more than two months, landing at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1620.The passengers onboard, mainly Christian Puritans, became known as pilgrims.This vessel will repeat their journey but without any humans on board, and a much faster anticipated crossing time of two weeks.The ship is being built by ProMare - a non-profit marine research organisation - along with IBM.The project's director, Brett Phaneuf, has ancestral roots in the area where the Mayflower landed on America's east coast, dating back to 1628.Mr Phaneuf grew up in New England hearing family folklore about the early settlers, and visiting sites connected to the crossing.He now lives in Plymouth, UK, and was inspired by his history to contribute to the commemorations of the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower.But he wasn't interested in building a simple replica of the ship.""Nothing really was going to do it justice,"" Mr Phaneuf says.""My immediate interest is in autonomy and we needed something that would speak to the next 400 years.""The ship is a trimaran with one very long slender main hull optimized for propulsive efficiency.The two smaller hulls are for stabilization and provide the surface area for the solar panels.The vessel will run on solar and wind power, with an emergency diesel backup generator if needed.The hull of the ship is currently under construction in Gdansk, Poland, and is due to arrive in Plymouth next February.""On a ship with no people there is a huge amount of volume left to do things with - there's nowhere for people to sleep, no need for storing food or water - all the things that keep people alive go away,"" says Mr Phaneuf.Mr Phaneuf says many ships already have highly automated systems, but keep skeleton crews of 6-12 people.""The ship is going to do oceanographic research but it is also an active test platform for artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms for collision avoidance,"" he says.The team will keep an eye on its progress from a control centre in Plymouth and can take over if there is an emergency.October 2019 - January 2020: Hull constructed in Gdansk, PolandFebruary 2020: Hull to arrive in Plymouth, UKFebruary - June 2020: Fitted out with advanced navigation and research equipmentJuly - August 2020: Testing at seaSeptember 2020: Sets off from Plymouth, UK, to arrive in Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA, two weeks later""Once it's past the Isles of Scilly, it's on its own,"" says Mr Phaneuf.IBM's deep learning software will help the vessel collect and analyse data to avoid collisions at sea, according to the company's chief technology officer Dr Andy Stanford-Clark.""We are fusing all that data to create a multi-dimensional view of the world,"" he says.""The ship can't keep going back to the cloud and saying 'can you check on this' as there will be long periods of time where there is no connectivity,"" says Dr Stanford-Clark.The ship will use IBM's sophisticated operational decision maker (ODM) tool, which is also used by the financial industry to make complex business decisions.Three research pods in the hull of the ship are being designed by scientists at the UK's University of Plymouth.Director of the University's Marine Institute, Richard Thomson OBE, says the voyage is the first opportunity to sample the oceans for plastics, from an unmanned vessel.Professor Thomson coined the term microplastics in a paper published 15 years ago, to describe the accumulation of fragments of plastic in the world's oceans.'We're trying to construct a heat map of the problem but it is based on pinpoint sampling and extrapolation,"" he says.""This is an opportunity to get a much deeper and data-rich picture of the situation.""The ship's ability to make its own decisions based on immediate data availability could lead researchers to remote areas where they wouldn't otherwise think to go.""In the future, ten years from now, if the boat is in the middle of the deep Indian Ocean, and it detects something unusual but its humans want it to do something else, it can divert itself, as it will be seeing more data and say 'this is where I want to go',"" says Mr Phaneuf.A future of autonomous vessels roaming across the world's oceans brings up several issues around insurance, cyber-security and piracy.Mr Phaneuf says this first voyage is being insured by insurance company Gard, which wanted to be the first company to insure an unmanned ocean vessel.The main threat in the North Atlantic, he says, will come from the weather and the ocean conditions, rather than other vessels.But not knowing what the ship will find is an exciting prospect.""We know more about the surface of the moon than the surface of the ocean. This is the first of many ships that will bring us to that state of knowledge,"" Mr Phaneuf says."
technology	Cloud computing's security pitfalls	Nasty neighbourClosed clouds	"The word cloud evokes images of all things soft and gentle; the kiss of a kitten or the soft touch of a lambswool mitten.While that might be true of clouds in the real world, those in cyberspace are turning out to be very different entities indeed, especially when it comes to security. Some of them are downright dangerous.The captivating idea behind using a ""cloud"" of computers is that it does away with having a dedicated data centre. Instead, companies get their number crunching done by a benevolent source of computational power that sits out there, somewhere, anywhere, on the net.It's the word cloud itself that is responsible for making this sound much more ephemeral than it actually is, said Martin Borrett, IBM's cloud security adviser.""There's a misconception that clouds are one thing and they are all fluffy,"" he said, ""but clouds do not have to be nebulous.""Researchers have shown that clouds are anything but misty and mysterious. The computer servers providing that on-tap processing power can be identified, enterprising scientists in Germany and Finland have found. Software tools written by these researchers identified individual servers making up a cloud and interrogated them to find out which chip that computer was running.That was important, they found, because more powerful chips get processing done more quickly. Given that many on-demand cloud services price by the hour, that could add up to a considerable saving. The researchers estimate up to 30%. Interrogating a cloud to work out how to save money sounds good on face value.But cyber-clouds are not as insubstantial as their name suggests. Unlike their wispy namesake, they can be found and become a target. That's bad because, as cyber-thieves and hackers know, there is a fine line between interrogating a computer and bullying it into coughing up details that help control it or can aid another attack.Researcher Yingian Zhang at the University of North Carolina and colleagues from Wisconsin and security firm RSA have already shown how this can provide a route to attacking and hacking a cloud.The technique developed by the team is complicated, but involves finding out how hard servers are being worked in a particular cloud.""Because we're sharing the resources there's a possibility some information will leak,"" Mr Zhang told the BBC. That's significant because many cloud providers run the computational jobs from different clients on the same hardware. There's no way for one company to know who its data is sharing memory with. It could be a bank, a bookshop or a bad guy.""Using the same resources is key to the cost and business model of cloud firms,"" he said. Knowing how hard those servers work under different conditions can give hints about the types of jobs they are being asked to do, he said.""How much resource is being allocated is dependent on the length of a cryptographic key,"" said Mr Zhang. Knowing how hard a server is working helps infer all kinds of useful information about what type of key is being used. That information is useful to attackers as it could radically cut down the number of possible combinations they have to try to unlock data encrypted or scrambled with that key.The dawning realisation that clouds can be found, interrogated and potentially attacked has given rise to a number of start-ups that aim to secure processing done on those cloud platforms.""Outsourcing your data cannot remove the obligation to protect that data,"" said Pravin Kothari, head of CipherCloud which provides tools to companies to scramble the data being uploaded and processed in a cloud.Fears about how the security of core business information when it was committed to the cloud had the potential to dampen moves to use the technology, he said.""Most of the growth in the use of cloud services is happening at the bottom end of the market,"" he said. ""It's small businesses taking it up.""When you get to large companies people are not comfortable,"" he said, ""And with sensitive applications that's when people get very uncomfortable.""For one of the biggest cloud firms, many of the security worries being flagged up by ingenious researchers are problems that are yet to be seen by the bad guys. Stephen Schmidt, security head for Amazon Web Services said the attack mounted by Mr Zhang and colleagues only worked in the lab.""Those kind of attacks tend to be more theoretical than practical,"" he said, adding that the many checks and balances on a live cloud service would stymie such an attack.However, he said, that was not to be complacent about the security of computation work being done in the cloud. All day, every day, he said Amazon helped its customers defeat hack attacks of all kinds.In many cases, he said, moving to the cloud helped companies finds out what was vulnerable.""Security starts with what knowing what you have,"" he said. ""In the cloud because of the way it works, you cannot log someone on under the desk. You can see exactly what you have."""

We have identified the root cause of this failure and are putting standards in place to prevent this from happening again.""In May 2013, Adobe stopped selling its Creative Suite product in favour of moving everything online.Rather than a one-off charge for a licence - which typically cost in excess of £2,000 - Adobe's Creative Cloud would instead charge a monthly subscription fee of around £45, or less for smaller packages.The move to the cloud was also seen as an effort to combat piracy - Adobe's products regularly rank as the most illegally downloaded worldwide."
technology	Amazon's 'dirty cloud' criticised in Greenpeace report	BlacklistWind energy	"A Greenpeace report into the green credentials of tech firms has singled out Amazon as having the ""dirtiest cloud"" services.Apple, Facebook and Google were praised for ""significant improvements"" in energy transparency and attempts to move to 100% renewable energy.But Amazon Web Services (AWS), which powers many net firms, only uses 15% clean energy, according to the report.The retail giant hit back, branding the report ""inaccurate"".The green activist group warned that more needed to be done to make the internet greener, particularly in countries experiencing huge net growth such as China.The electricity demand of internet and cloud services has grown exponentially, according to the report, Clicking Clean: How Companies are Creating the Green Internet.And it is expected to increase by 60% or more by 2020 as reliance on the internet increases.""Apple, Facebook and Google are powering our online lives with clean energy and building a greener offline world for everyone in the process,"" said Gary Cook, Greenpeace's senior IT analyst.It represents a turnaround for Apple which two years ago was criticised in a 2012 Greenpeace report, How Green is Your Cloud.The firm went from a 35% use of renewable energy in 2010 to 75% by the end of 2012.Amazon though has remained on Greenpeace's blacklist.Amazon Web Services, which hosts a large part of the internet including for companies such as Netflix, Spotify, Tumblr, AirBnB and Pinterest, currently only sources 15% of its electricity demand with clean energy, according to the report.Coal powers 28% of the company's cloud, nuclear 27% and gas 25%.""By continuing to buy dirty energy, Amazon Web Services not only can't seem to keep up with Apple, but is dragging much of the internet down with it,"" Mr Cook said.Greenpeace also criticised Amazon and Twitter for their refusal to reveal any details about their energy footprint to their customers or the public.In response, Amazon told the BBC: ""Greenpeace's report misses the mark by using false assumptions on AWS operations and inaccurate data on AWS energy consumption.""It was not able to elaborate on what the inaccuracies were but said that two of its data centres used 100% carbon-free power.""Running IT infrastructure on the AWS Cloud is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing that depends on small, inefficient, and over-provisioned data centres,"" it said.Of the 19 leading internet companies evaluated by Greenpeace, only five have committed to a goal of powering their operations with 100% renewable energy.Apple was the first firm to achieve its 100% renewable energy goal. It operates the largest privately owned solar installation in the US at its North Carolina data centre.Meanwhile Facebook is powering its utility in Iowa with wind energy, which in turn prompted energy firm MidAmerican to invest $1.9bn (£1.1bn) in wind power energy.Google has also used wind energy to provide electricity for services such as Gmail and YouTube."
technology	Celebrity hacks: How to protect yourself in the cloud	Fame's pitfallUnaware uploadsWiped but not gone	"The release of hundreds of intimate images of celebrities has raised questions about the security of the online services used to share many of the snaps.It has also got many people wondering how they can avoid becoming a victim in a similar way. What steps can they take to protect those images and stop them being pilfered and shared?""Choose better passwords,"" says Oliver Crofton, a founder of Select Technology Concierge that provides secure tech services for the rich and famous.""From experience with incidents in the past it typically comes down to weak passwords.""Using a password that is easy to guess or sharing one among different services can give attackers the edge they need to break into someone's many other social media and online accounts.""They get into the email addresses associated with that individual and then they intercept a re-set request and log in,"" he said.Mr Crofton says at least once a month a Select client will call saying they have had a ""strange re-set request"" that is probably evidence of an attempt to get at their online life.Such attempts aimed at either the famous or ordinary user can be thwarted by plumping for services that use two-factor authentication, said Ken Munro, a security expert from Pen Test Partners.These systems use a separate channel, such as a text message sent to a mobile phone, to send a code that must be entered whenever an account is accessed from a new location or device.""Unless someone has directly compromised your box then it's tough to catch out,"" says Mr Munro.Common sense should also be exercised when people are exchanging intimate images, he said.""It's reasonable to expect to have some degree of privacy online,"" says Mr Munro. ""But if you do not want people to see it then maybe you should think more about the controls you put around it.""Working out a password chosen by a public figure can be straightforward because so much of their life is public, adds Mr Crofton.Because fame can arrive very quickly, information that was once private by dint of being obscure can suddenly become accessible to the public via gossip sites.""We do a lot of work with footballers and those guys' lives can be transformed overnight by a transfer deal,"" he explains.""Security is one of the last things they think about.""There are advisors around these people to talk about tax and banking and physical security but they do not worry about data.""By the same token, scrutiny of anyone's online life can give lots of clues about the words they may be using for passwords.The names of children, pets, sports teams and sports stars are all favourites judging by the words found on lists of top passwords regularly shared online. These can also be the answers to the secret questions many services demand people answer before starting the re-set process.However, says Mr Crofton, there are cases when attackers go to extraordinary lengths to dig out passwords.""There was a similar case about 18 months ago involving a password that a hacker had got by scraping the webpages related to their partner's business and managed to get the combination from that,"" he says.James Lyne, chief security researcher at Sophos, says a ""strong"" password contains at least 14 characters. However, he says that getting people to use passwords this long is a challenge.""It would be nice if we could get most of the population at least as far as eight characters,"" he acknowledges.In addition, says Mr Lyne, recycling passwords across sites or using the same one with only minor variations presents little challenge to attackers.Another step is to regularly review the permissions granted to apps downloaded to a phone.Many of the celebrities caught out may not have known that their phone was uploading images to the net, suggests Mr Lyne.Stopping apps from uploading data automatically is a great way to add a layer of defence and prevent inadvertent sharing, he adds.Chris Boyd, a veteran security researcher from MalwareBytes, says there are further easy steps people can take to stop private data becoming public.""First and foremost, people need to get into the habit of removing photos from a phone and then, on a regular basis, putting them on an external hard drive,"" he says.Encrypting that hard drive would then prevent individual files being accessed even if that drive goes missing.Checking that the images had been properly deleted on the phone is crucial too, he says,""It's no good having them secure in your left hand but easy to access in the right.""In addition, he says, it is worth people familiarising themselves with the policies of the cloud-based services they use.Deleting a file that has been uploaded may not mean that it has gone, he explains, and some even offer the chance to ""undelete"" supposedly trashed files.Such a function could be a boon to an attacker.""That's great if you accidentally deleted something you meant to keep,"" he states.""But not if it's something private you want gone."""
technology	TEDGlobal: Cloud schools offer new education	'Cloud grannies'	"Children in developing countries could educate themselves using computers, the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh has been told.Prof Sugata Mitra was outlining details of the first ""school in the cloud"".While there would be an online adult moderator at times, the pupils would largely organise themselves, he said.Meanwhile, an MIT professor laid out his vision of bringing the very best university education to some of the poorest parts of the world.Prof Anant Agarwal already has one million students enrolled in his online school, edX, an online platform offering courses from some of the highest-profile universities.He started the non-profit website because he believed it was time for a radical shake-up of education.""Education has not changed in 500 years - we still herd children like cats into classrooms at 9am.""Such a model might work to a certain extent in the developed world but for many parts of the world, another way of doing things is needed.The edX platform now has 27 university partners, all offering online courses in a wide range of subjects.""For the first time, learners are able to take course from some of the best professors in the world,"" said Prof Agarwal.The cost of running the platform has been boosted with investments of $60m (£38m) from MIT and Harvard universities and the site is hoping to fund itself in the future by licensing some of the online courses back to universities to offer a more blended learning experience for all students.At the main TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in LA in February, Prof Sugata Mitra was awarded a $1m (£638,000) prize fund to set up a series of cloud schools.At TEDGlobal he laid out how he intended to spend the money and what a cloud school would be like.""A school in the cloud is basically a school without physical teachers. We need this because in many places you can't get teachers or the teachers are very bad,"" he said.Initially he intends to set up five cloud schools, three in India and two in the UK, near the University of Newcastle where he teaches.The remotest of the locations is Korakati, a village in eastern India, where he hopes to build a school in the next four months.It will be very different from a conventional school - a glass pod filled with computers and with one large screen to allow moderators to Skype in and play a role in the education of the children.The moderators will be drawn from Prof Mitra's ""cloud granny"" programme, which is already up and running in the UK and India.Retired people in the UK connect via Skype to a variety of community-run youth clubs in India, offering a range of activities, with the most popular being reading them stories.What their exact role in the cloud schools will be is unclear - ""I don't know what they will do,"" said Prof Mitra.For him, the key part of the project will be to let the children self-organise.There will be no timetables or curriculum and much of the learning will be left to the children.""We will let 300 children in on the first day and all hell will break loose. But gradually they will start to organise themselves,"" he said.The model for the schools is drawn from the hole-in-the-wall computers that Prof Mitra set up in the slums of India in 1999.The computers came with no instructions and were simply left for children to explore for themselves. The way they developed skills amazed Prof Mitra.He expects that a similar pattern will emerge in the cloud schools.""In the first few weeks they will go berserk with games. Then one child will discover Paint and the others will copy. After four months they will discover Google,"" he said.The children will not be pre-warned about the moderator but at some point in the first couple of weeks they will appear on the big screen.""They will be life-size because this is important to children. It will be interesting to see how they react,"" said Prof Mitra.The only rule in the school will be when it shuts.""I will close it at sundown otherwise I will have all the mothers after me,"" he said.He has already talked to mothers from the remote village of Korakati, but most were baffled by what he was trying to achieve.""One thought that the children were going to be taught by ghosts,"" he said."
technology	Cloud-based archive tool to help catch child abusers	Finding victims	"Victims of child sexual abuse could soon be identified more quickly thanks to law enforcement agency work on a cloud-based archive of abuse material.The database has been created to help investigators cope with the vast amount of images abusers typically amass.It will help police forces quickly check images seized in raids and spot those showing children not seen before.Forces in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are helping test the database.Called Project Vic, work on the archive is being co-ordinated by the US Department of Homeland Security and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.James Cole, a national programme manager at Homeland Security, said the project grew out of the realisation that there was huge duplication of effort among those investigating abusers and the material they trade.That problem was particularly acute in the US where there were tens of thousands of local police forces and jurisdiction on some crimes shared across local, state and federal agencies.""We have issues with deconflicting investigations and also big issues with the amount of data that we are seizing,"" Mr Cole told the BBC.Across all the crime categories it investigates, Homeland Security seizes ""petabytes"" of data every year, he said, adding that it was a signature trait of abusers that they amassed large collections of images and videos.The Project Vic approach uses technologies and software from companies such as Netclean, Hubstream and others to allow investigators to categorise known material. This allows them to concentrate on never-seen-before material and produce a unique summary or ""hash"" for each new item, said Mr Cole.""The idea is to allow law enforcement to run data against hash sets that are immediately available through cloud services,"" he said. ""They can interrogate that data in real time and know a lot of things about it very quickly.""Project Vic is also seeking to promote and get backing for a new standards-based image formatting system. This would generate hashes using an open protocol and should make it straightforward to exchange comprehensive sets of hashes domestically and internationally without having to touch or manipulate the data.Finding unique images more quickly would help police and other agencies focus on victims and material that had never been seen before, said Mr Cole.""When material is produced you hope to trace it back to an offender and stop them producing or having further opportunities to exploit the child,"" he said. ""We are making great strides in how we do that.""Rich Brown from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, said Project Vic would help work being done globally to tackle abuse crimes.""Project Vic represents the largest movement of its kind to change the way investigators approach this crime set,"" said Mr Brown.Among abusers, material had become a kind of currency, said Mr Cole.""In well over 90% of our cases there's no money changing hands,"" he said. ""It's the material itself that is highly desirable for offenders. Money does not come into play.""New material has the highest value among abusers and it was incredibly useful to spot it so investigators can focus their efforts on it and work towards freeing victims, he said.""The way we identify and rescue these children is by putting all that related information together,"" he said.Unfortunately, he added, there were also cases in which investigators made little headway and just had to watch victims grow up among abusers.""Sometimes,"" he said, ""the clues are just not there."""
technology	Microsoft and Sony strike games streaming deal	'Best choice'	"Microsoft and Sony have formed a partnership on video games streaming, despite being fierce competitors.It is expected Sony will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud service to host its upcoming PlayStation streaming service.Microsoft has been trialling a streaming offer of its own, under its Xbox brand.The firms said they would also work together on semiconductors and artificial intelligence applications.""For many years, Microsoft has been a key business partner for us, though of course the two companies have also been competing in some areas,” said Kenichio Yoshida, Sony’s chief executive.“I believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content.”Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said: ""Sony has always been a leader in both entertainment and technology, and the collaboration we announced today builds on this history of innovation.”The two companies have been bitter rivals in gaming since the launch of the first Xbox console in 2001.But in its pursuit to compete with Amazon Web Services, hosting PlayStation’s streaming service would be a major coup for Azure, the fastest growing part of Microsoft’s business.For Sony, if its PlayStation is to remain competitive, it too is likely to need to move heavily into streaming full, high-quality games over the internet.Industry analysts say Sony might have struggled to do it alone.""Everybody else has a head start on them,” said Rebekah Valentine, from GamesIndustry.biz.“There was a lot of discussion that Sony seemed to going the traditional route of making a normal console and continuing with what they had been doing in the past. This partnership with Microsoft shows they are fully exploring streaming technology.”Sony already has a significant footing in games streaming - its PS Now service, which offers streaming access to the PlayStation back catalogue, accounts for 36% share of the $387m global games streaming market, said analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, from IHS Markit.However, with the streaming market expected to expand rapidly over the next five years, Sony’s comparative lack of expertise and infrastructure left it exposed.""It is clear that Microsoft is the best choice for Sony even with the competitive dynamic between Xbox and PlayStation,” Mr Harding-Rolls said.""Working together they have a better chance to head off competition from the likes of Google, which has gone on to dominate the last wave of technology disruption in the mobile space alongside Apple.""While precise details of the partnership are still vague, the companies also said they would be working together on new semiconductors, image sensors and artificial intelligence.For Microsoft, that opens the door to getting its cloud technology integrated into more consumer products, such as cameras and televisions, rather than working mostly on business applications as it does today."
technology	BitTorrent Sync challenges cloud-based file management	Fast and privateSafety net	"Developers of the BitTorrent file-sharing process have opened an experimental data-synchronising tool up to the public.BitTorrent Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to send information between users' PCs.It eliminates the need to upload data to a third party's computer servers, as is the case with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive.But one analyst said businesses were unlikely to be tempted by the idea.Davies Murphy Group's Chris Green said companies would worry about their lack of control over the new process even though it did not rely on a third-party's data centre to update what might be sensitive files.But he said it might appeal to some members of the public for private use.BitTorrent is an eight-year old San Francisco-based company offering a range of free-to-use products designed to make it easy and quick to send large files over the internet.They work by co-ordinating the process so that devices downloading material also share small pieces of already-accessed data with others in order to share the load.Although the technology has become associated with media piracy due to its use by some media-sharing sites, BitTorrent itself is a legal company that makes money by licensing its technology and brands to business customers.It began testing the new tool at the start of the year. The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out.It suggested users might find it quicker and more private than the alternatives.""Since Sync is based on P2P [peer-to-peer technology] and doesn't require a pit-stop in the cloud, you can transfer files at the maximum speed supported by your network,"" it said.""Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud; your data is protected by encrypted keys. Your files belong to you, and stay on the devices of your choice.""To prevent unauthorised access to shared data, the software generates a private key for each synched folder on the original device.This is made up of at least 32 characters and must be entered into all the other devices to which the information is sent to in order for the files to be accessible.One of the benefits of synching software is that it allows a user to ensure any changes made to a document on one machine are copied to all their other devices.In its current state, BitTorrent Sync achieves this by noting the change and then copying the whole updated file to other computers, replacing any earlier version.This means it may be less efficient in some cases than some of the cloud-based services that can detect which parts of a file have been changed and only copy over those bits of the data.However, BitTorrent has indicated that it too hopes to introduce ""differential sync"" later this year.The technology has the potential to disrupt the nascent file-synching industry.Although Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Apple, SugarSync and others offer a limited amount of free storage on their services, they make money by charging customers who need to transfer and synch large files such as video footage or lots of smaller documents.However, Mr Green suggested the earlier cloud-based technique could ultimately prove superior.""One of the reasons why Dropbox and Google Drive use central servers as middle-men between your devices is that the server plays an important role in ensuring the most recent version of the document gets pushed to each device and doesn't overwrite more recent updates.""When you are working on a straight device-to-device peer-to-peer method like this it's a lot harder to ensure that safety net.""However, there's obvious appeal for some people who like the idea of not being beholden or reliant on a third-party who may have technical problems or go bust taking all their data with them."""
technology	Faster chips 'cut cloud-computing bills'	Hardware help	"Users could cut 30% off their bills for on-demand computer services by working out what sort of chip is on the servers they are renting, research suggests.On-demand, or cloud, services are built around what are advertised as clusters of generic computer servers.But analysis reveals that some clusters are 40% faster than supposedly identical groups of machines.The statistics were gathered by working out which processors were used in the hardware behind the cloud service.The research was done by computer scientists at the Deutsch Telekom Laboratories in Germany and Finland's Aalto University, who did their analysis on Amazon's EC2 cloud service.Cloud services let people rent computer power by the hour. A lot of small businesses use such services instead of running their own servers. In addition many others call on them when they have a short-lived need for a burst of computer power.Amazon promotes its service as using generic hardware that offers the same performance to every customer.Using tools that can interrogate the software that controls the groups of servers customers rent, the researchers identified the chip at the heart of each server in a group or instance of computers.By taking measurements for a year, the researchers were able to spot which instances were running newer, faster chips.Instances built around these newer machines were much faster than the clusters that used older hardware, said the researchers.""In general, the variation between the fast instances and slow instances can reach 40%,"" wrote the researchers in a paper detailing their efforts. For some applications the differences were even more stark, with newer clusters working about 60% faster.By choosing the faster instances, users could cut up to 30% off their server bills, as the newer machines would to crunch through data much faster, they said.The researchers are now working on tools that can work out the performance characteristics of particular clusters and swap work to more powerful groups."
technology	Sony buys Gaikai cloud gaming service		Sony has confirmed it is acquiring cloud-based gaming service Gaikai.The Computer Entertainment division of Sony is spending $380m (£242m) to take over the firm which streams games to players.For its cash Sony will take over the running of Gaikai's data centres and the infrastructure behind its service.It is thought Sony will use the Gaikai technology to offer a broader portfolio of games to owners of its PlayStation 3 consoles.Gaikai is one of several online gaming systems that let people play games by streaming the action to a PC. It means players can enjoy speedier access to games because only the part they are currently playing is sent to them. By contrast, when downloading, an entire game must be delivered and installed before it can be played.In addition, Gaikai's technology also allows gamers to play titles intended for consoles without owning one of the devices.Details of the deal are scant which led gaming news site MCV to speculate that Sony would use Gaikai to help with a future PlayStation 4 console.It is not clear what impact the acquisition will have on Samsung's plans to offer gaming via its smart TVs through Gaikai. Samsung announced its deal with Gaikai at the E3 trade show in early June.
technology	Experts warn on wire-tapping of the cloud	Foreign policyTiny supercomputer	"Leading privacy expert Caspar Bowden has warned Europeans using US cloud services that their data could be snooped on.In a report, he highlights how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendment Act (FISAAA) allows US authorities to spy on cloud data.This includes services such as Amazon Cloud Drive, Apple iCloud and Google Drive.He told the BBC this heralded a new era of ""cloud surveillance"".Mr Bowden, former chief privacy adviser to Microsoft Europe, made a name for himself as a privacy advocate when the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) came into force in the UK in 2000.Parliament accepted some of the amendments proposed by Mr Bowden as the then director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research.Now he has turned his attention to US legislation and has co-authored the Fighting Cyber Crime and Protecting Privacy in the Cloud report which was recently presented to the European Parliament.In it he said that FISAAA ""expressly permits purely political surveillance"", so that anyone with stored information relating to US foreign policy could find themselves of interest to the US authorities.""Anyone who, for example, belongs to a campaign group which may oppose some aspect of US foreign policy, whether it be the Iraq war or climate change,"" he said.The FISAAA was originally drafted in 2008, and was recently renewed until 2017. It was added on to existing legislation to take account of cloud computing, which was just emerging as a means of data storage.""What's amazing is that nobody really spotted it for four years,"" said Mr Bowden.""When FISAAA was extended to cover cloud computing, encrypting data to and from the cloud becomes irrelevant so it is surprising that nobody noticed this,"" he added.Adam Mitton, a partner at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, agreed that the FISAAA could be a threat to privacy but questioned how much it was used.""In theory there is a clear threat to the privacy of European citizens, but in reality the fact that it is obscure suggests that the threat isn't as great as it might be perceived,"" he said.""If it was being used by an authority and having an impact on individual citizens, I think that the source of the information would come to light. The legislation is now five years old and I'm not aware of any case that has relied on it,"" he added.Storing data in the cloud is becoming hugely popular not just for consumers who use it to keep photographs and other personal data safe but for businesses which are increasingly using cloud services to offer back-end processing power.Under the FISAAA, US cloud providers can be compelled to release data from any citizen living outside of the US.""The fibre-optic cable that carries the data is split and a miniature supercomputer scans all the data in real-time with any material of possible interest being instantly copied to the NSA [National Security Agency],"" said Mr Bowden.The court order is made in secret and remains secret - meaning it would not show up in things such as Google's transparency reports, which aim to document data requests from governments around the world.""We have long known that the Americans can spy on foreign data but FISAAA extends this to reach inside the data centre. It allows the authorities to enact surveillance on a mass scale because it is wired into the infrastructure,"" Mr Bowden said.A hearing on the European Parliament's findings of the report is due next month."
technology	OnLive's founder leaves cloud video games service	Big name hold-outsGoodbye message	"The founder of OnLive - the cloud-based video games service - has left the firm, after organising a controversial rescue of the business.A statement said Steve Perlman had stepped down as chief executive ""to work on his myriad of other projects"".The news comes just over a week after he sold the firm's assets to a venture capital firm, wiping out its investors' stakes and its staff's share rights.The new owner had previously said Mr Perlman would remain in his post.The founder was not given redundancy pay and was not required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.Silicon Valley-based Lauder Partners bought OnLive's technology, trademarks and patents after Mr Perlman used a technique known as ""assignment for the benefit of creditors"" as an alternative to bankruptcy.Under the terms of the arrangement, cash raised is used to pay off the original company's lenders.Last week the Insolvency Services Group - a business involved in the process - said that OnLive had owed between $30m to $40m (£19m to £25m) and was facing collapse.When questioned about this, a spokeswoman for the new OnLive company told the BBC that ISG had spoken too soon and ""did not have all the information to make the estimate"".OnLive is a pioneer of ""on demand"" cloud-gaming services. It uses remote servers to carry out processing work before sending video of its games' graphics to users' homes.This allows subscribers to play games written for consoles, on other devices such as tablets, PCs or - with the help of a special adapter - TVs.Mr Perlman had hoped to shake up the video-games industry and launched the system in the US, UK and Belgium.But the biggest games publishers, Activision and EA, refused to support the business, and some users were put off by the fact they did not own physical copies of the titles they had paid for.Despite this Gary Lauder, managing director of the venture capital firm that now runs the OnLine service, said he believed it still had a bright future.""I spent my first week with OnLive listening, to gather people's thoughts and suggestions,"" he said in a statement.""It's an impressive group, and I am even more convinced that this company is poised for greatness"".He added that Charlie Jablonski, former head of OnLive's operations, would become its acting chief executive.OnLive had previously said that it had offered ""almost half"" the original workers their jobs back with the same salary as before.But there have been reports that many were unhappy to have lost their right to stock in the firm and the way the restructure had been handled.Both Venturebeat and The Verge tech sites have reported that several workers had demanded Mr Perlman's permanent resignation before they would consider returning.The move may also help the new business attract other investors after BT, HTC, Warner Bros and others lost the millions of dollars they had invested in the original OnLive.""It helps to have a clean break with the past, and Perlman was the face of the business - the question is now whether they can find a full-time new visionary leader rather than just someone who was part of the previous team,"" Ed Barton, director of digital media at Strategy Analytics, told the BBC.""Given what has happened previously any investor will now want a high-risk premium, a lot of transparency and a very clear road map to profitability.""The main difficulty won't be getting people interested, but getting them to agree to a valuation which will inevitably be much lower than what it had been when others got involved.""Mr Perlman posted a message to the service's users on the OnLive Fans community website to mark his departure. In it he indicated that he had left of his own accord rather than being ousted.""For me, the end of last week was the first time in a very long time where I could actually consider the possibility of moving on without having to worry about the company,"" he wrote.""Gary did want me to stay, but OnLive is by far the longest project I've ever worked on, I have other projects long in need of my focus and attention, and Gary needed to lock down the structure for the new company.""In the balance, it was a good time to move on, and Gary understood."""
technology	UK government may miss cloud computing targets	Security fearCultural shift	"The government may miss its cloud computing targets because of a lack of enthusiasm from public sector IT staff, a report has found.The G-Cloud plan calls for 50% of new government IT spending to move to cloud computing services by 2015.A government ""app store"" called CloudStore was launched in February to offer such services to the public sector.G-Cloud aims to reduce government IT costs by £200m per year.G-Cloud was first announced as part of the government's ICT strategy in March 2011. It echoes the US Government's Federal Cloud Computing Strategy which require US agencies to evaluate cloud computing options before making any new investments.CloudStore is intended to make it cheaper and easier for public sector organisations to choose and buy ""off the shelf"" IT services such as email, word processing, enterprise resource planning and electronic records management that meet government standards.It is also intended to prevent government departments getting locked into lengthy and expensive IT contracts.But 59% of the IT staff surveyed for the report said they were ""undecided"" on whether to use CloudStore to buy cloud services.The reasons given for not using the store included being tied in to existing contracts for these services, worries about security, and a lack of understanding about cloud technologies, the report found.The study, called ""Smart Savings 3, G-Cloud Progress,"" was commissioned by VMware, a company that makes cloud software.""Some of these are good reasons - if a department is locked in to a long term contract then that's a problem,"" said Andy Tait, VMware's head of public sector strategy and former deputy G-Cloud director.""But there is also an element of cultural resistance as this is a change to the way things are done.""Only 31% of those surveyed said that they would probably or definitely use the CloudStore to procure cloud services.But Zafar Chaudry, chief information officer at Liverpool Womens' and Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trusts, believes that cloud services can provide a very effective way for public sector organisations to cut costs.He has replaced four data centres operated by the trusts with cloud services, and said this had resulted in costs savings of 10%.""We are in a short term contract, and in the future I will certainly be looking at the CloudStore to try and reduce costs further,"" he said.""The public sector has some very old ways that need changing,"" he addedIn a statement the Cabinet Office said G-Cloud was a new initiative and its early work on the project had been geared towards making it sustainable in a way that would make it quicker and easier to buy services.Despite CloudStore only being launched early in the year several public sector organisations had already bought services through it, said the statement.""Given this strong early interest we are confident that we can reach our long-term target of 50% of new public IT spending coming through G-Cloud by 2015,"" it added."
technology	BBC launches 'digital wellbeing' Own It app for children	Online risks	"The BBC has created a ""wellbeing"" smartphone app called Own It aimed at children.It monitors how young people interact with friends and family online and through messaging apps.It uses AI to evaluate a child's mood so it can offer advice or encourage them to talk to trusted adults.The app is designed to offer help and support especially if children are about to share sensitive data or send an upsetting message.""The digital world is a fantastic place for people to learn and share, but we know many young people struggle to find a healthy online balance, especially when they get their first phones,"" said Alice Webb, director of BBC Children's, in a statement.Ms Webb said the app would act as a ""helping hand"" to guide children into developing good habits when using their first phone and avoid some of the potential pitfalls of digital life.The app is built around a special software keyboard that pops up when kids type messages and monitors the tone of the words being typed and language used.The Own It app also has its own content that aims to help children manage the amount of time they spend looking at their screen and passes on other advice about responsible online interaction.The BBC said the app would also regularly encourage children to talk to parents and guardians about good and bad online experiences and their phone use.The app has no reporting system that parents can consult to oversee phone use, said the BBC.The app would be ""warmly welcomed"" by some parents, said Prof Sonia Livingstone, a social psychologist from the London School of Economics who heads the EU Kids Online project which researches the digital diets of younger people.Prof Livingstone, who has seen demonstration versions of Own It, added: ""Based on my research on children's online risks and opportunities, I think it should be very helpful for children, especially younger ones, and ideally would also stimulate constructive conversations between children and parents.""She said one of the ""strengths"" of the app was the effort it took to protect a child's privacy. This stood in contrast to other apps that many parents use to monitor and control their children's online lives.However, said Prof Livingstone, there were likely to be limits on its usefulness for some young people.""The challenge will be to get it to the children who are more at risk online,"" she said.The Own It app began development in 2018 and has drawn on input and support from many different child-focused charities and welfare groups.Partners include the Mental Health Foundation, the Anti-Bullying Alliance, the NSPCC, the Diana Award and Childnet.The app is being launched against a background of research which shows how concerned some parents are about phone use among their offspring.One study published in August suggests half of all UK parents want mobiles banned in schools to help regulate use.Separate studies suggest teenagers are not damaged by prolonged screen use but official advice in the UK says parents should tell children to put down their devices in the hour before bed."
technology	BBC to launch digital voice assistant		"The BBC is planning to launch a digital voice assistant next year, the corporation has announced.It will not be a hardware device in its own right but is being designed to work on all smart speakers, TVs and mobiles.The plan is to activate it with the wake-word Beeb, although this is ""a working title"", a spokesman said.BBC staff around the UK are being invited to record their voices to help train the programme to recognise different accents.Analyst Ben Wood, from CCS Insight, was among those who have expressed surprise at the news.He said he feared the BBC would find it difficult to compete with the tech giants already in this market, such as Amazon, Google and Apple.Chinese tech firm Baidu and Amazon had a combined 43% share of the global smart-speaker market in the second quarter of 2019, according to a new report from Canalys.Firms like this are already able to invest ""eye-watering sums"" to solve the challenges presented by regional dialects and still face problems, Mr Wood said.He also expressed scepticism about the choice of the wake-word.""Typically voice assistants use a multi-syllable word or phrase such as Alexa or Hey Google to ensure accurate identification. I fear Beeb might end up being unreliable,"" he said.The BBC said the word had worked well in its research so far but added that it was not a final decision.It said that that having its own assistant would enable it to ""experiment with new programmes, features and experiences without someone else's permission to build it in a certain way"".""Much like we did with BBC iPlayer, we want to make sure everyone can benefit from this new technology, and bring people exciting new content, programmes and services - in a trusted, easy-to-use way,"" said a spokesman.""This marks another step in ensuring public service values can be protected in a voice-enabled future."""
technology	TikTok's young fans 'exploited' for digital gifts	Taking a cutPromised rewardsExploitedFeeling guiltyDeceptive	"Video-sharing app TikTok says it is ""sorry"" that some children and other young people have felt pressured into sending money to their favourite influencers on the app.TikTok lets fans send their favourite videomakers ""digital gifts"", which can cost up to £48.99.A BBC investigation found influencers promising to share their phone numbers with fans in exchange for the gifts.TikTok said it would strengthen its policies and guidelines but did not explain exactly how.Claire (not her real name) told BBC News she regretted spending £100 to obtain her favourite TikTok star's phone number - and he had never answered his phone.Claire, 12, who lives in the north-west of England, sent TikTok star Sebastian Moy a £48.99 ""drama queen"" gift to show her appreciation for his videos.And when he had asked for another one in exchange for his personal phone number, she said she was swept up in the moment.The US-based video-maker has 3.8 million fans on TikTok and has not broken any of the app's rules.He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users, although the company doesn't disclose its userbase. It's estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores.The app lets people post 15-second videos. It is known for clips of teenagers lip-syncing and dancing to the latest trending music.The company says it is most popular with 16- to 24-year-olds but there is evidence that many users are under 13, which is against the app's rules.The firm has already been fined $5.7m (£4.5m) by a US regulator after being accused of collecting under-13s' personal details without their parents' consent. And on Tuesday, the UK's Information Commissioner revealed she had also launched an inquiry into whether the app was doing enough to safeguard its youngest users.""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" said Elizabeth Denham.Videomakers with more than 1,000 followers are allowed to broadcast live on the platform. It is during these live streams that fans can send digital gifts to show their appreciation.Gifts appear as on-screen animations and cost between 5p and £48.99. The app's biggest stars can earn thousands of pounds in one live stream.TikTok declined to say how much of that money it kept - but several influencers told the BBC they took home 50% of all gift revenue earned.Over 10 weeks, the BBC monitored dozens of live streams in which the app's stars asked fans for gifts.In exchange, they promised shoutouts on their live streams, said they would follow back fans on social media or offered to make ""duets"", which allow users to collaborate with TikTok stars in a split-screen video.One creator promised to talk to a fan on Instagram ""for a week"" and was given three gifts worth a total of £147.Some creators routinely offered personal messaging details and phone numbers in exchange for gifts.The BBC also found a group who scoured the app for people giving gifts and then contacted them directly asking for money in exchange for ""likes"" and ""follows"".Stephanie Barbour, from Toronto, found her 11-year-old daughter had run up a bill for $400 (£240).""I was shocked when I found out what the money was spent on,"" she said.""I said to my daughter, 'So you don't actually get anything for it?' and she said, 'No.'""Adults should know better. And even other teenagers should know better - that you do not ask children for money.""Another TikTok fan, Kelly, told the BBC she had spent £500-£600 of her own money on digital gifts. She no longer sends them because she feels she was exploited.""I understand people need to make money these days off social media but I just think it's force-fed down young people's throats that they need to pay money to get attention or feel appreciated,"" Kelly said.Rhys, 20 said he had spent more than £1,000 without realising it.""Gifting on TikTok is a little bit like gambling,"" he said ""It gets addictive. I really didn't see anything wrong with it at the time but now I don't think it's worth it.""I have nothing to show for it. It was my personal choice but I do think there should be some sort of age restriction or timeout function.""The BBC contacted several of the TikTok stars seen using such techniques but most of them did not reply.The Neffati brothers have amassed 2.5 million followers in just six months on the platform.The 25-year-old Polish twins who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, are famous for their dancing and comedy sketches.They offer to follow back fans in exchange for a ""drama queen"" gift, worth £49 and promise to write fans' names on their heads if they send multiple gifts.They told the BBC that they had only started offering perks in exchange for gifts because they had been receiving them regularly.They said they were simply following the lead of other creators on the platform and that most of the fans that sent gifts were about 30 years old.But they said they did feel guilty when they received gifts from young fans.""We don't like it when our gifters are young, so basically we ask them if their parents know about it,"" they said.""But we can't stop them. We can't stop it. We are going live not only for the money but we are going on the live to get more audience.""Rhia, from south Wales, and has 2.5 million fans thanks to her creative video-editing skills.She said her average fan was about 10 to 14 years old and they were always happy with the perks she offered in exchange for gifts.But she also feels uncomfortable when she receives several gifts from very young followers.And she would like to see stricter age limits on gifting.""It would give us peace of mind as creators,"" she told the BBC.""It would make you feel more ethical because taking money from children is not a good way to earn a living really.""Livestream gifting originated in China - where TikTok's owner Bytedance is based. The practice is far more popular there. Professional ""cam girls"" earn huge amounts from their audiences.In the West, tipping has become more common especially on gaming platforms such as Twitch.However, the rapid rise of TikTok is testing the business model like never before.TikTok declined to answer specific questions but told the BBC it was investigating digital gifting.In a statement, it said: ""We do not tolerate behaviours that are deceptive in nature and we are sorry to hear some of the users' experiences.""We recognise there is always room for improvements in terms of making guidelines and information more accessible, clear and easy-to-understand for all users.""We value your feedback and will further strengthen our policies and product features.""The company gave no details on what policies or community guidelines it would change.Alessandro Bogliari, from the Influencer Marketing Factory, said there was wider pressure on TikTok to make changes.""These sorts of stories are not good for a social network that is becoming popular with brands and marketers,"" he said.""The app has major potential but there is clearly work to do to improve things.""I think more parental-control features would be a good idea and some sort of cap on the amount users can gift per day or per livestream.""They could also make the guidelines more clear and ban the use of certain terms that 'hard sell' to users."""
technology	Facebook won't rule out digital currency launch without US approval	No clear answer	"Facebook is facing immense pressure from US regulators over its plans to launch a digital currency, Libra, in association with more than 20 partners including Visa, MasterCard and Uber.As well as co-creating the Libra currency, Facebook plans, on its own, to offer its own digital wallet, called Calibra. Like a physical wallet with cash, Calibra will store a users’ Libra, and make it possible to engage in transactions with other wallets.Libra has the potential, lawmakers say, to dramatically disrupt the global banking industry - a digital currency that can cross borders, without the wild price fluctuations and illegal connotations of Bitcoin and its ilk.Which is why David Marcus, the Facebook executive of its currency project, was brought in front of two US congressional committees last week to answer concerns.“I want to be clear,” Mr Marcus said in his opening statement to US lawmakers. ""Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.""But what exactly did that mean? A pledge not to launch anywhere without US approval, or just a pledge not to launch in the US?Almost a week later, it’s difficult to get a clear answer from Facebook about whether it feels it needs US lawmakers on board in order for Libra to go ahead.Midway through last Wednesdays’ hearing, the second two hour-long session, I dropped the company a note seeking clarification.“If the US doesn't give approval, but Facebook gets approval elsewhere in the world, will Libra’s launch go ahead in those places?” I asked.A spokeswoman replied, telling me: ""David [Marcus] committed that Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals. This is Facebook’s commitment. We will be offering Libra through Calibra. Calibra will only launch in jurisdictions in which we have approval to launch.”That didn’t quite answer the question on whether the Libra project would still go ahead if the US didn’t approve, or if Calibra - the part which Facebook will run on its own - would be available in other countries, if not the US. So I tried again.""If the US is yet to approve Libra/Calibra, but country X does, will Facebook launch Calibra in country X?”The spokeswoman said she wouldn’t comment on a hypothetical scenario. Fine. I tried again.""Is it Facebook’s position, today, that in the absence of US regulatory approval, it intends to launch Libra in other markets, subject to local regulators’ approval?”“Nothing more to share on this,” the spokeswoman said.It’s hard to stay out of the weeds on this one. Technically, Facebook isn’t in charge of the Libra Association, and so can’t be solely responsible for its actions. But when I tried to reach the other partners on the project to get their view, most directed me back. “Facebook is spearheading [leading],” said one rep from a payments company. “You need to talk to them.”Facebook’s spokeswoman confirmed to me that when Mr Marcus made his commitments to Congress, he was referring specifically to Calibra, the wallet, rather than the wider Libra currency. A spokeswoman for the Libra Association said on Tuesday it would only launch when it had ""addressed applicable regulatory issues and received appropriate approvals"". But that likely won’t be enough for US lawmakers concerned about the impact the project could have on the dollar.""Mr Marcus was very clear that Facebook 'would not launch until all concerns are addressed' and I believe he is a man of his word,” senator Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in an email to BBC News.""With Libra backed by the US dollar and dollar-denominated securities, its launch will have very real consequences - and poses very legitimate stability and soundness concerns - for the US, even if Facebook chose not to launch it in the US.""I appreciate Facebook engaging policymakers on this front and fully expect them to adhere to Mr Marcus’s commitment not to launch Libra - full stop - unless and until the concerns of regulators are addressed.”There could, however, be little the US can do - the Libra Association will be headquartered in Switzerland. On Tuesday, a Facebook spokeswoman reiterated the view that it would seek approval in the jurisdictions it operates.""Engaging with regulators, policymakers, and experts is critical to Libra’s success,” the spokeswoman said.""This was the whole reason that Facebook along with other members of the Libra Association shared our plans early. The time between now and launch is designed to be an open, collaborative process. We will take the time to get this right.”But, again, neither Facebook, nor a spokeswoman for the Libra Association itself, would be drawn on what would happen elsewhere if the US feels Libra should not go ahead._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	OneCoin lawyer found guilty in 'crypto-scam'		"A US lawyer has been found guilty for his role in the OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, which raised billions of pounds from investors convinced they were buying into a new digital currency.A New York jury found that Mark Scott helped to perpetrate the scheme, routing approximately $400m (£310m) out of the US while working to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds.Prosecutors said he made about $50m.Mr Scott's lawyers had said he did not know that OneCoin was worthless.They said he was simply doing the job asked by Dr Ruja Ignatova, a co-founder of the Bulgaria-based OneCoin.The federal jury in Manhattan rejected those arguments, finding Mr Scott guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud.Dr Ignatova's brother, who testified in the case, also recently pleaded guilty for his role in the fraud.US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case.In total, investigators believe as much as £4bn was raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK among other countries.""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys said in one filing.""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand.""Dr Ignatova, an ex-McKinsey consultant, disappeared from view around October 2017. There has not been a confirmed sighting since.However, the Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing.""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,"" it said in a recent statement given to The Missing Cryptoqueen, a BBC podcast.It added: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully proceedings against OneCoin. We are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established.""Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast"
technology	Apple 'loses money on phone repairs'	Maps	"Apple says it loses more money than it makes when repairing customer devices such as iPhones and Macbooks.Answering questions from US politicians investigating anti-competitive practices, Apple said it had lost money on repair services since 2009.Apple typically charges more than unofficial repair shops to fix things such as smashed screens.But the company also said customers were ""free to obtain repairs from any repair shop of their choice"".In September, Apple was sent a list of questions by a US House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating ""competition in digital markets"".In response to a question about how much the company earns from repair services, Apple said: ""For each year since 2009, the costs of providing repair services has exceeded the revenue generated by repairs.""The company currently charges £326.44 to replace the screen on its new iPhone 11 Pro Max, and £596.44 for other repairs on the device, if it is out of warranty and the customer has not bought the AppleCare+ protection plan.It charges £152.44 to replace the screen on an out-of-warranty iPhone 8.Prices at unofficial repair shops vary, but are usually significantly cheaper than an official repair.The BBC found third parties retailers that would replace an iPhone 8 screen for between £50 and £90.""Unfortunately, there's no way to fact check Apple's accounting on repairs because of the vagaries of revenue reporting,"" Kay-Kay Clapp from the independent repair website iFixit.""Knowing how much we pay for parts and the general labour costs of the repair industry, it seems unbelievable that they're not making money from repair services.""Responding to the US committee, Apple said: ""Repairs performed by untrained technicians might not follow proper safety and repair procedures and could result in improper function, product quality issues or safety events.""Asked whether it took any action to block consumers from seeking an unauthorised repair, the company said: ""Apple does not take any actions to block consumers from seeking out or using repair shops that offer a broader range of repairs than those offered by Apple's authorised technicians.""Apple told the BBC it had nothing to add to its written answers to the committee.Apple also answered questions about the Maps app, which is pre-installed on its iPhone and iPad devices.In 2012, the company was criticised for removing Google Maps as its default navigation app. Many customers said Apple Maps had launched before it was ready.In its answers to the committee, Apple said it had invested ""billions of dollars"" in its map software.It suggested the reason it decided to develop its own Maps app was to give customers more control over their privacy."
technology	Kids' social media app ad banned on health grounds		"An advert suggesting that children could gain likes and followers to progress through an app has been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the phrase ""get likes and followers to level up"" could have a ""detrimental effect on youngsters' mental health and self-esteem"".The ad was ""likely to cause harm"" and was ""irresponsible"", it added.PopJam argued that its app encouraged ""positive digital engagement"".It pointed to other ways to make progress through the app, such as by sharing drawings and taking part in quizzes and creative challenges.SuperAwesome Trading, the firm behind PopJam, argued that the app - designed for seven to 12 year olds - was a walled garden of social content ""designed to ensure [childrens'] privacy, safety and well being.""It said that likes and followers in the app did not signify social status, rather they were there to help progress through the levels on the app.The television advertisement was seen in July on CITV with large text stating ""likes"" and ""followers"", with an image of a number rising quickly from 96 to 10,000, while a female voiceover stated, ""Get likes and followers to level up.""The ASA said in its ruling: ""We considered [the ad] explicitly encouraged children to seek likes and followers in order to progress through the app"".It acknowledged that there were other ways of advancing in the app, but said that these were not explained in the ad.""We considered that the suggestion that the acquisition of likes and followers was the only means of progression was likely to give children the impression that popularity on social media was something that should be pursued because it was desirable in its own right.""The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form, it concluded.According to an Ofcom report, 78% of 12 to 15 year olds feel pressure to look popular on social media.This was acknowledged by PopJam, but it said the report also recognised that nine in 10 children of the same age stated that social media also made them feel happy and closer to their friends."
technology	UK's controversial 'porn blocker' plan dropped		"The government has dropped a plan to use strict age verification checks to stop under-18s viewing porn online.It said the policy, which was initially set to launch in April 2018, would ""not be commencing"" after repeated delays, and fears it would not work.The so-called porn blocker would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages, or face a UK ban.Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said other measures would be deployed to achieve the same objectives.The government first mooted the idea of a porn blocker in 2015, with the aim of stopping youngsters ""stumbling across"" inappropriate content.Pornographic sites which failed to check the age of UK visitors would have faced being blocked by internet service providers.But critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restriction using virtual private networks (VPNs), which disguise their location, or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law, such as Reddit or Twitter.Likewise, platforms which host pornography on a non-commercial basis - meaning they do not charge a fee or make money from adverts - would not have been affected.There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites could ask users to upload scans of their passports or driving licences.It was a plan, said ministers, to protect children from stumbling across pornography - an objective bound to be hugely popular with parents and anyone concerned about child safety. But throughout its troubled life the porn block has met opposition from across the political spectrum.The critics said it was an attack on civil liberties, it was the government trying to censor the web, it could endanger privacy and any database of porn users would be a honeypot for scammers. Most of all questions were raised about whether it would work, with pornography shared on social media sites not affected by the ban, and savvy teenagers able to use VPNs to get round it.Now the fifth culture secretary to be in post since the idea was first mooted has dropped the plan. Nicky Morgan insists its objectives can still be achieved via the new regulator envisaged by the recent Online Harms White Paper.But expect more wrangling about the precise nature of the ""duty of care"" the watchdog will impose on the pornography websites and how they will be punished for any failings.In a written statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Morgan said the government would not be ""commencing Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 concerning age verification for online pornography"".Instead, she said, porn providers would be expected to meet a new ""duty of care"" to improve online safety. This will be policed by a new online regulator ""with strong enforcement powers to deal with non-compliance"".""This course of action will give the regulator discretion on the most effective means for companies to meet their duty of care,"" she added.OCL, one of the firms offering age verification tools, was not happy about the decision.""It is shocking that the government has now done a U-turn and chosen not to implement [this],"" said chief executive Serge Acker.""There is no legitimate reason not to implement legislation which has been on the statue books for two years and was moments away from enactment this summer. [This] would have protected children against seeing pornography on the internet, a move which would undoubtedly have been welcomed by all sensible parents in the UK.""But Jim Killock, executive director of civil liberties organisation Open Rights Group, welcomed the news.""Age verification for porn as currently legislated would cause huge privacy problems if it went ahead. We are glad the government has stepped back from creating a privacy disaster, that would lead to blackmail scams and individuals being outed for the sexual preferences.""However it is still unclear what the government does intend to do, so we will remain vigilant to ensure that new proposals are not just as bad, or worse.""In June, the porn blocker was delayed a second time after the government failed to tell European regulators about the plan, leading Labour to describe the policy as an ""utter shambles""."
technology	Social-media influencers: Incomes soar amid growing popularity	Instagram influencersConsumer law warningInfluencer articles	"The money made by social-media influencers has risen meteorically in the last few years, according to a new report.Marketing firm Izea found the average price of a sponsored photo on Instagram has jumped from $134 (£104) in 2014 to $1,642 (£1,276) in 2019.Brands appear willing to pay handsomely to sponsor posts, videos, stories and blogs, too, says Business Insider.But one expert insists it will not mean the end of traditional advertising.""Digital marketing is the equivalent of word of mouth but there will always be a mix between that and traditional advertising,"" said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, chief executive of social media marketing platform Socialbakers.Average charge per photo postThe report looked at sponsored content on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and blogs, examining negotiated rates from 2014 to 2019.From micro-influencers - people with fewer than 100,000 followers - to celebrities, it found that there was good money to be made.Among the findings were:As more and more people join the rush to become social-media influencers, the industry has gained more scrutiny from regulators.Last month, three influencers had Instagram posts touting diet products banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, which dubbed them ""irresponsible"".And at the beginning of the year, the Competition and Markets Authority warned that some influencer posts could break consumer law if they did not make clear when posts endorsing products were ads.Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley were among 16 influencers who agreed to change the way they posted content.Brands will continue to pour money into social-media advertising, according to data from Socialbakers.Average charge per blog postIts research suggests that influencer-sponsored posts grew by 150% in the last year, with the use of the hashtag #ad more than doubling.It predicts that brands will up their spend on influencer marketing in 2020, making it a $10bn industry.Instagram is currently experimenting with hiding ""likes"" on posts but Mr Ben-Itzhak does not think this will have an impact on the influencer industry.""Influencers will still be able to see what engagement they have and it is common practice to grant permission to brands so that they can see that too,"" he said.""The bigger question will be whether consumers will continue to engage when they can't see 'likes'."""
technology	Budget 2018: Who will pay the Digital Services Tax?		"It was one of the more surprising features of the Budget, a Digital Services Tax designed to make tech giants earning vast revenues in the UK pay their fair share.Now comes the difficult part - working out how the tax will be designed and who will pay it.The tax looks as though it is targeted at the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook - the Treasury says it will apply to search engines, online marketplaces and social media firms.""You can't specify the named firms so you think what characteristics catch them but not start-ups,"" says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury civil servant who now works for the Institute of Government.She says the chancellor will have had two worries in designing the tax - ""catching things he doesn't want to catch - or not catching what he does want to catch.""But tax lawyer Dan Neidle from Clifford Chance says there is a guiding principle behind the tax. ""The highfalutin theory is that value is being created by users for these companies and not being taxed. So for instance, you put a picture of a cat on Facebook, people click on an advert next to it and Facebook earns money from that.""Social media firms and search engines will pay the 2% tax on the advertising revenue earned from UK users in this way. When it comes to online marketplaces, the aim is not to put a tax on the payment from the consumer but on the ""platform fee"", the commission paid by the merchants using the market.Firms will only pay the tax if they have global revenues of at least £500m. They have to be profitable, and the first £25m of UK revenues will be tax free. The Office for Budget Responsibility says around 30 companies could end up being affected. So let's look at who might fit into each category:So for now it seems that only American tech firms could qualify. ""Very few British firms are big enough - this is aimed at US giants and that brings a risk,"" says Heather Self at the accountants Blick Rothenberg. She warns that if the Trump administration sees this tax as effectively a tariff on successful American businesses that could end up with a complaint to the World Trade Organization.What is clear is that there is a lot of painful work ahead on a tax which, in the words of Heather Self, will raise a lot less than the chancellor earmarked for mending potholes.Jill Rutter from the Institute of Government says even the £400m projected return is ""the most uncertain figure in the Budget"", though she suspects Facebook is one firm that will pay up without making a fuss: ""2% is a drop in the ocean for them. Nick Clegg (Facebook's new communications supremo) may advise them it's not worth the reputational risk to argue about it.""If the tax was about assuaging public anger about the low tax paid by giant firms, it may not do the job - after all the world's wealthiest business, Apple, and Uber, one of the most controversial, both seem unlikely to be affected,.""The problem with sector-specific taxes is you create lots of uncertainty - and lots of work for people like me,"" says Dan Neidle. So at least the tax lawyers will be happy."
technology	Facebook challenged over political ad policy	Why has this happened?Political ad ban	"Facebook says it will fact-check ads posted by one political candidate in California, after previously saying it would not do so for politicians.In September, the social network said it would not subject politicians or candidates to fact-checking.To test the policy, Californian Adriel Hampton registered as a candidate and tried to run a misleading ad.But Facebook blocked the ad and said Mr Hampton had ""registered as a candidate to get around our policies"".In September, Facebook clarified its fact-checking policy and said it would treat all posts by politicians as ""newsworthy content"" that should ""be seen and heard"".Critics said the move would give politicians complete freedom to create deliberately misleading advertisements that could be promoted to millions of people on the social network.In October, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was questioned by US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the policy.She asked whether she would be allowed to run ads on Facebook falsely claiming that Republican candidates had backed the ""Green New Deal"" environmental policy.""I think probably,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.Mr Hampton, who runs a digital media agency, was inspired to create exactly such an advertisement.In the ad, footage of US senator Lindsey Graham was edited to look like he was speaking in support of the Green New Deal.It was posted on the Facebook page for a political campaign group called The Really Online Lefty League (Troll).Facebook eventually took the advert down.Mr Hampton posted on Twitter, asking whether any US politician would run the false ad to test Facebook's policy.He then announced he had registered to stand in an election for governor of California and would try to run a false ad himself.But Facebook said in a statement: ""This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking.""Mr Hampton said: ""Apparently, it's only OK to lie on Facebook if you don't tell them you're lying.""On Wednesday, Twitter announced it would be banning political advertising globally.Chief executive Jack Dorsey said the reach of political messages ""should be earned, not bought"".But Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee investing fake news and disinformation online, said the move could have unintended consequences.""The problem on [Twitter] has been big networks of fake bot accounts, rather than legitimate advertisers. This move could make life easier for the peddlers of fake news,"" he tweeted."
technology	Android Pie: Google adds Digital Wellbeing controls	Why Pie?Will it really make me use my phone less ?How have notifications been improved?How has Google boosted battery life?What else is new?	"Android Pie - Google's latest version of its mobile operating system - has been released.The software introduces a new way to track usage of apps on a smartphone or tablet and lets limits be set, including the removal of colour from the screen at a chosen time of the day.The ninth edition of Android also offers more powerful notifications and promises to extend battery life.But Google continues to face issues with the distribution of its updates.According to its own figures, only about 12% of in-use Android devices were running the previous version - Oreo - as of a fortnight ago.Google says that it has worked with third-party device-makers to make it easier for them to check and deliver the updates than before.But for now, the new upgrade is only being made available to its own Pixel phones.Google always picks a dessert or confectionery-based nickname for its mobile OS, shifting one letter along the alphabet each time.Past examples have included Jelly Bean, Kit Kat, Lollipop and Marshmallow.There had been speculation that the next name could be Pistachio Ice Cream, Pop-Tart or Pumpkin Pie.But the chief of Android's London engineering team explained that there had been a deliberate decision to keep things simple.""It hints at the same goals we have with Android in general,"" said Andrei Popescu.""We want to simplify the user interface, we want to make the usage simpler and more intuitive.""And I think that kind of resonates with a very simple and beautiful name like Pie.""One of the new software's headline features is its new Digital Wellbeing controls.These are in part a response to criticism that smart devices can be ""addictive"" and disruptive to our sleep patterns.A dashboard provides ways to see how much time the owner has spent using their device, with a breakdown of the hours and minutes dedicated to their most popular apps.Timers can then be set to limit usage of specific programs.When the limit nears, users get a warning - and when it is reached the app's icon becomes greyed out to prevent it from launching. The lockout can, however, be overridden.Wind Down Mode is intended to act as a further prompt to put down the device at the end of the day.At a pre-selected time, the screen switches from colour to greyscale - meaning all imagery is seen in shades of grey. In addition, the Do Not Disturb mode is activated, silencing incoming calls and alerts.Apple is introducing its own Screen Time controls to iOS 12 with a similar goal.But one physiologist said adults and children alike must be educated about the benefits of the new facilities to ensure they are widely adopted.""These are good measures, but there are still going to be a lot of people who don't think they have a problem,"" said Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake.""So, there will still need to be a lot done to educate people about the pitfalls of becoming unhealthily dependent on the use of their phones and apps.""Pie adds images to the alerts - showing both a small picture of the person who contacted the recipient, when relevant, as well as previews of any photos or other media they may have shared.In addition, the operating system will now allow users to reply to received messages via the notifications themselves using a Smart Reply facility.This will attempt to predict and offer the desired response, allowing the owner to send it without having type it in themselves.The tech firm has taken a two-pronged approach to the common complaint that devices run out of power too quickly.Firstly, it has attempted to take advantage of a common feature of modern mobile processors to minimise battery use when the display is turned off.Many CPU (central processing unit) chips now feature ""big-little"" architecture, whereby some processor cores prioritise speed while others focus on being more power-efficient.Android Pie now schedules many of its background processes to run on the more efficient ""little"" cores in order to consume less power.The second approach involves trying to prevent what Google describes as ""bad battery days"".To do this, the system studies an owner's behaviour in order to anticipate when they will want to use certain apps.By doing this, it can stop unlikely-to-be-opened apps using the CPU and battery to carry out tasks that could be deferred until later when the device is recharging.Huawei already offers something similar in some of its phones using its own machine learning techniques.The other biggest innovation is Slices, which brings parts of an app's user interface to the fore without requiring the owner to open the program.For example, entering a taxi app's name into the search bar might bring up information about how far away the service's nearest car is and how long it would take to get the user home.However, this facility is not set to go live until later this year.Other innovations that will be offered at launch include:"
technology	Digital skills gap opens up in English schools	More from Rory on this topic:'Exclusive' computing	"There is new evidence that the revolution in computing education in English schools is faltering - and that fewer children are getting the digital skills that employers and the government say are vital.It comes in the annual computing education report from the University of Roehampton which looks at how many pupils achieved GCSE and A-level computing qualifications in 2017.ICT (Information and Communication Technology) - which was widely derided as being no more than a course in Microsoft Office skills - is being phased out of the curriculum and disappears after this summer as an exam subject.But its replacement at GCSE and A-level is the far more challenging computer science.The report says this subject is proving very hard - both for the students and for the schools which need to find the staff to teach it.In 2017, just over half of all schools in England offered the subject at GCSE level - smaller schools and those in the independent sector were less likely to give pupils the chance to study computer science.But overall, only 12% of all students choose to take the subject.It is also proving less attractive to girls than ICT - they make up only 20% of GCSE entrants.Entries by pupils from poorer backgrounds are also lower.The typical computer science entrant, says the report, is ""academically strong, mathematically able, likely to be taking triple science, from a relatively affluent family, and overwhelmingly likely to be male (even if the smaller number of girls taking the subject do better in the exam)"".And while entries for the new subject have been gradually rising they are not keeping up with the fall in those for ICT.After that exam disappears this summer, it looks as though there will be a big fall in the overall number of 16-year-olds achieving some form of computing qualification.""This will disproportionately impact girls, poorer students and some ethnic minority groups,"" warns the report.Since 2014, 30,000 fewer girls have got a computing qualification by the age of 16.There is also concern that budgetary pressures will affect the ability of sixth form colleges to continue offering the A-level in computer science.Most of them have so few students taking the subject that they are below the minimum viable class size set by the Department for Education.The authors of the report said they welcomed the introduction of computer science into the curriculum but they now believe ICT should be retained as an alternative.""The government's refusal to renew GCSE and A-level IT, against the will of the teaching community, is making computing more exclusive,"" says Peter Kemp from the University of Roehampton.""The overemphasis on computer science seems likely to lead to fewer students, particularly girls, studying any digital qualification at school. I think it's time to rebalance what's on offer.""The Chartered Institute for IT also expressed concern, saying it estimates that the UK needs half a million more children to gain a computing qualification each year.""We still have a lack of young people with the work-ready digital and computing skills that our economy needs.""But the Department for Education says the computer science GCSE is providing pupils with a ""gold standard"" qualification equipping them with the skills they will need for the hi-tech jobs of the future.A spokesperson said: ""Entries for computer science continue to rise more quickly than any other subject, increasing year-on-year since its introduction.""But the latest figures for exam watchdog Ofqual for 2018 - not included in the Roehampton report - show the rise in entries for computer science slowing to only 4%.With ICT entries down 40%, that means a fall in the total number entering for a GCSE of more than 14,500.If the aim of overhauling the computing curriculum in England was to give more children digital skills, it appears to be failing."
technology	Apple acquires digital magazine platform Texture		"Apple is buying the magazine app subscription service Texture for an undisclosed amount.Texture offers US-based users unlimited access to more than 200 titles for a monthly fee of $9.99 (£7.19).It is currently owned by Next Issue Media, which is backed by magazine publishers Conde Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Communications, and Time Inc.Apple said it was ""committed to quality journalism from trusted sources"".Texture was launched in 2010 and won a ""Best Of"" award from the App Store editorial team in 2016One media analyst said the move to acquire Texture was Apple's way of trying to appease content publishers, who were upset by the launch of its News app in 2015.At the time, content publishers said they were concerned that the News app would threaten which types of content users had access to, and change the ways in which people consumed content.""A lot of this is talking the talk. If they really wanted to help journalists, they could give publishers a waiver on the 30% tax Apple takes from App Store revenue,"" Enders Analysis's Joseph Evans told the BBC.""That wouldn't cost Apple anything, and it would be a big help to publishers.""But instead they do these user-facing things.""He acknowledged, however, that Apple's involvement could boost interest in the eight-year-old service, which in turn would help publishers earn more money.Apple already runs a music-streaming subscription service and has been commissioning new television content, leading to speculation that it might launch a rival to Netflix."
technology	Social media urged to suspend political advertising	'Unrelenting' toxicity	"Targeted political adverts on social media should be suspended until they are properly regulated, says an international group of lawmakers.Testimony given to the International Committee on Disinformation and Fake News warned of ""dire"" consequences if action was delayed.The committee met in Ireland as part of its work to scrutinise how online platforms handle political adverts.But Facebook told members it should not be the world's ""truth police"".The statement came as Facebook policy chief Nick Clegg said the social network was ""considering"" limiting the targeting political parties can do via its platform.In an interview with Politico, Mr Clegg said it might rein in so-called ""microtargeting"" that aims ads at particular interest or age groups.The committee was formed in 2018 following an investigation by the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee into disinformation and fake news.Politicians, lawyers, policy advisers, rights activists and data-protection regulators from 12 different nations are all represented on the committee.They signed a declaration calling on countries to ban political ads temporarily after concerns were aired about misleading information already used in adverts for many different elections.""The toxicity is unrelenting,"" said Jim Balsillie, founder of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, in a statement given to the committee hearing.He said the business model adopted by social networks made ""manipulation profitable"" and led to attempts to influence people via many different means.Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said social networks had been exposed and fined many times for not doing enough to protect their users.He reserved particular criticism for Facebook and said while regulators had sought to oversee its actions in the past, more work was needed.""The longer enforcement action is delayed the more dire the consequences,"" said Mr Rotenberg.Facebook's head of global policy, Monika Bickert, defended the company and its stance on political advertising.She said in some countries, identities had to be verified before ads could be placed and said it now used third-party fact checkers to scrutinise claims made in adverts.""In mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinised speech there is,"" said Ms Bickert.""We therefore don't believe that a private company should be determining for the world what is true or false in a politician's statement.""Earlier this week Facebook banned an advert from a UK tax campaign group for breaking its rules on political advertising.At the same time, UK academics, campaigners and non-profit groups sent a letter to Facebook and Google asking them voluntarily to suspend ads until after the general election on 12 December.The letter said the "" legislative blackspot"" over the regulation of adverts was ""concerning"", as was a lack of transparency over how people are targeted.A BBC investigation into political ads for next month's election suggested they were being targeted towards key constituencies and certain age groups.Facebook's stance on adverts has been criticised by experts who said it gave politicians freedom to create deliberately misleading content.Twitter has taken a different stance and decided in late October to ban all political advertising globally from 22 November.""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" said Twitter boss Jack Dorsey."
technology	Can kids hold pens in the digital age?		"Children's habits are changing. Where once a toddler might have played with bricks, now they are more likely to play on an iPad.Such devices can provide a welcome distraction for busy parents and an attractive source of sensory stimulation for young children but does it mean that children are not developing the fine motor skills they need to write?Sally Payne, head paediatric occupational therapist at the Heart of England foundation NHS Trust has seen evidence this is the case.She recently told the Guardian newspaper: ""Children coming into school are being given a pencil but, increasingly, they are not able to hold it because they don't have the fundamental movement skills.""To be able to grip a pencil and move it, you need strong control of the fine muscles in your fingers.""Children need lots of opportunity to develop those skills,"" she added.Ms Payne blamed the proliferation of tablets and smartphones in toddlers' lives for the children's inability to grip and hold a pencil.""It's easier to give a child an iPad than encouraging them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes,"" she said.A few years ago a video clip of a one-year-old baby girl frantically swiping at a magazine went viral, illustrating that children firmly inhabit a digital world.According to the communications regulator Ofcom, more than half of UK households own tablet devices, rising to 76% for smartphones.Dr Jane Medwell is part of the Write Your Future campaign - a group championing the importance of handwriting.She said that the proliferation of gadgets in homes meant that ""some children don't get as much pencil play as they used to"".And habits learned from parents are changing too.""The earliest thing you may see now is a parent texting on a phone while in the past it might have been someone writing a shopping list by hand, so children's experience of early literacy has changed,"" Dr Medwell explained.But she does not believe the case is yet made for linking more tablet time to a lack of motor skills.""We don't have research that says using a tablet means you can only swipe and not hold a pencil and we don't even know whether there are less pencils in homes,"" she said.What there is evidence for though, is the importance of handwriting.A 2005 study from the neuroscience laboratory at Aix-Marseille University divided 76 children aged three to five into two groups - one wrote by hand, the other using a computer.The researchers found that the group that learned to write letters by hand were better at recognising them than the group that learned to type them on a computer.And a 2016 study, published in the journal Psychological Science, found that students typing up notes from TED talks tended to take verbatim notes whereas those writing longhand were forced to be more selective.While both remembered facts such as dates, the group that wrote notes were better at remembering conceptual questions.For very young children, there are also huge benefits in writing.""There is lots of good stuff on tablets and phones but children need the conventional literacy world too,"" said Dr Medwell.""How you create a letter, how you make complex movements. It takes practice and it helps children learn literacy,"" she added.Dr Mellissa Prunty, a lecturer in occupational therapy and the vice chair of the National Handwriting Association, is cautious about making a link between tablet/phone use and handwriting skills.""There are other factors such as spelling and language development, but also how much handwriting children engage with at nursery or pre-school groups and how much writing they do at school,"" said Dr Prunty.Most of the handwriting referrals she has in her clinic are from children with underlying conditions, such as Developmental Coordination Disorder, known as dyspraxia.""What occupational therapists on the ground are observing now are children without any underlying impairments,"" she said.""Although this is an interesting observation, we don't know from a research point of view if technology is impacting on fine motor skills generally and whether that is having a knock-on effect to handwriting.""In 2015, Finland became one of the first countries in the world to stop making cursive handwriting classes compulsory.The move was partly a recognition that keyboard skills were going to be far more useful to the current generation of digital natives.Indian schools too have abandoned cursive writing in favour of clean, legible print.By contrast, in late 2017 the US state of Illinois passed a law requiring school students to learn joined-up handwriting.We do write less than we used to do.A study from 2014 suggested that one in three adults went six months without writing anything by hand but in education, writing remains a key skill.""At the moment, handwriting is the main medium of writing from primary school to university and it is a skill that children have to acquire,"" said Dr Prunty.""If handwriting is laboured that can have a knock-on effect to all areas of writing from spelling, punctuation to generating ideas,"" she added.As to whether it is important to learn the grandiose cursive writing our grandparents excelled at, Dr Medwell is not convinced.""Children need an efficient way of writing, this means ""correct"" letter movements are vital and need to become second nature,"" she explained.But, she added, there is no empirical evidence that a joined up style improves writing.And for some children who struggle with the technique, forcing them to use it could in fact be ""counter-productive"" she said."
technology	Libra: PayPal first to drop out of Facebook cryptocurrency		"Payments firm PayPal has become the first company to pull out of an alliance that is trying to launch Facebook's digital currency Libra.PayPal made the announcement in a statement on Friday, but did not specify what had prompted the decision.Libra, and its digital wallet Calibra, were revealed by Facebook in June.But the cryptocurrency has been criticised by regulators, and both France and Germany have pledged to block it from Europe.PayPal said it ""[remained] supportive of Libra's aspirations"" but had chosen to focus on its own core businesses.The firm was one of the original members of the Libra Association, a group of 28 companies and non-profits helping to develop Libra. Its other members include payments company Visa, ride-hailing app Uber and humanitarian charity Mercy Corps.In response to PayPal's withdrawal, Libra Association said it was aware that attempts to ""reconfigure the financial system"" would be hard.""Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else,"" it said in a statement. ""We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now.""At its unveiling this year, Facebook said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Partner firms would also be able to accept Libra for transactions.Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting.But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency.The Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns had been addressed.Central bank chiefs, including the UK's Mark Carney, have also voiced scepticism, and US President Donald Trump has tweeted he is ""not a fan"" of the currency.The Libra Association will hold the first meeting of its governing body - the Libra Council - on 14 October.The group said in a tweet that it planned to share updates soon afterwards about ""1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate""."
technology	UN warning on growing digital 'chasm'	No access	"The digital divide separating developed and developing nations is in danger of becoming a chasm, warns a UN report.The divide has grown thanks to accelerating net connection speeds in developed nations and static ones elsewhere, it said.And 52% of the world's population still has no access to the internet, said the organisation's Global Broadband Progress report.Improved net access was a key driver of other social goals, it said.The average global net access speed was now about 7.2 megabits per second (Mbps), said the report which looks at how broadband, mobile phones and other communication technologies are used around the world.However, it added, that headline figure masked significant differences between nations. In general, it said, net connection speeds in more developed nations were rising faster than elsewhere.For instance, it said, the average access speed in South Korea was now about 28.6Mbps and peak speeds of more than 184Mbps had been seen in Singapore.By contrast line speeds in many developing nations, such as the 1.5Mbps available in Nigeria, had not improved significantly since the last UN broadband report was released last year.A ""chasm"" could emerge because of the ""deepening inequality in global connectivity between starters, adopters and front-runner countries"", said the report.The differences between nations with a mature hi-tech infrastructure and developing nations were also deepened because wider use of technology could help other social goals, said the UN.Greater use of information and communication technologies could accelerate a nation's progress towards, for example, more sustainable agriculture or better health for citizens.""Digital tools can increase access to health, empower patients, and provide better health information and education for all,"" said the UN.While technology was playing a part in helping many nations progress, the UN also noted that a majority of the world's population, 52%, still had no net access at all.There were also regional differences, with Europe topping tables of net access with 76% of its citizens being able to go online. By contrast, only 21.8% of people in Africa could access the internet.""Large gaps in connectivity persist, mainly due to the lack of infrastructure, affordability, lack of skills or lack of relevant local content,"" said the report."
technology	NHS Digital approves data off-shoring in new guidance		"NHS Digital has said that individual care providers can choose to use public cloud services to store patient data.According to its new guidance, health data can be hosted offshore within the European Economic Area (EEA) or with certain US organisations.The benefits include reduced costs and more flexible data sharing, according to NHS Digital.But the digital rights organisation Open Rights Group says allowing offshore data hosting is ""dangerous"".NHS Digital has included a four-step guide to migrating to cloud services, which covers risk assessments and choosing data hosting locations.The guidance says that implementing data protection is ""legally complex"".A cloud service's technical and support staff may be based in a different country from where the data is hosted but still have access to patient information.In the US, only organisations that are part of the Privacy Shield scheme in partnership with the EU can safely host patient data, according to the report.The Privacy Shield allows individual companies to comply with EU data protection requirements despite not being based in one of the 28 member states.The European Commission can also approve countries not listed in the guidance for data hosting, according to the guidance.Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said that the Privacy Shield scheme was ""highly open to legal challenge"".""This is a dangerous move that could open up patient data for surveillance purposes, and that could have ramifications for patient health.""""People might avoid getting care, which would obviously be very bad. Patient confidentiality has to come first."""
technology	Transgender people treated ‘inhumanely’ online	'Hurt and hopeless'Politics and race'Why is transphobia a free-for-all?'	"""Tranny"" and ""shemale"" are the slurs most commonly used against trans people online, according to a study.Anti-bullying charity Ditch The Label and its analytics partner Brandwatch described the harassment as being ""inhumane"".Researchers analysed 10 million posts on the topic of transgender identity, shared from the UK and the US over a period of three-and-a-half years.They said more than 1.5 million of them were anti-trans.Other common transphobic themes of online posts included misgendering people - purposefully labelling somebody as a gender that they do not identify as.Video streaming sites and message boards were found to host the most transphobic abuse and the ""least constructive conversation"" about trans lives.""This report uncovers the shocking and inhumane ways in which transgender people are targeted, harassed, and abused on digital platforms,"" said Ditch the Label's chief Liam Hackett.""Using the largest dataset of its kind, it is easy to see how, left unchallenged, digital hate speech can and does evolve into acts of physical violence committed towards trans people.""Kenny Ethan Jones is a transgender male model and activist.""Transphobia is something I witness every single day,"" he told the BBC.""I'm often intentionally misgendered and I'm always on the receiving end of comments like, 'You're not a real man,' 'You're confused and you need God,' 'You don't deserve to live.'""I wonder if people understand the effect that these abusive comments have on my mental health.""Some days I feel hurt and hopeless.""The study compared transphobia across a range of sites, including social media, blogs, news outlets and forums.Larger sites such as Twitter and Instagram had the lowest percentage of abuse in general discussion around trans issues, at 5% and 12% respectively.Whereas on video streaming site YouTube, 78% of such discussion was abuse. Researchers said it should be noted that the volume of posts on this site was much lower than Twitter and Instagram.Comments sections on news sites made up much of its abuse total (19%), and forums featured a high percentage of abusive language (40%).Meanwhile, mentions of trans issues across most of the site categories were more hostile in the US.The BBC has approached Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for comment.The transphobic insult ""tranny"" featured more than 1.2 million times between 2015 and 2019, accounting for 80% of the insults studied.""Shemale"" had 150,000 mentions.The researchers also found examples of dead-naming: purposefully using a transgender person's previous name from before they transitioned.In the UK, politics appeared to be a key theme associated with the abuse, with the topic appearing in 27% of all the transphobic posts.Race came a close second. It was raised in 24% of the transphobic messages, and was especially common when the abused person was black.In the US, race was found to be the main driver, appearing in 34% of the abusive comments, followed by politics, which was raised in 33%.Parenting topics were also seen to be used as triggers for transphobia, with people using their parental status - ""as a mother of two kids…"" - to justify their views. This type of abuse tended to centre around the parents' fears, for example not wanting their children to be around trans people.In addition, transphobic slurs were used by some sports fans alongside racist, sexist and homophobic abuse, even when the intended victim did not identify as transgender. For example, Serena Williams had transphobic insults directed at her because she was not deemed to look feminine enough.Jay Hulme is a 22-year-old children's poet from Leicester. He's a transgender man and he says he constantly receives harassment on social media because of his identity.""It can be a full-scale hate storm with thousands of people attacking me relentlessly for days, or individual accounts sending general hate. I've been called an abuser, a sexual harasser, a sexist. I think the worst ones would have to be the times people call me a paedophile, just because I'm trans and write books for children.""About four or five months ago I started an instant block policy when it comes to anyone who sends me harassment on Twitter. As of today, I've blocked almost 5,000 accounts who reached out and sent me transphobic messages.""He thinks social media companies should do more to prevent their platforms being used for hate speech.""Online harassment of trans people is a really prevalent problem, and often goes a lot further than the things people say in real life.""Social media companies should do more, but I think there's a lack of understanding of transphobia within their teams so they struggle to counter it. Also, they should do more for all kinds of hate - their moderation tactics have been proven ineffective time and again.""For more stories like this, follow the BBC LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte on Twitter and Instagram."
technology	Tech Tent: Diversity and digital footprints	Gender and codingHellblade's Psychosis journeyMy Digital Footprint	"What makes a good software engineer and why have women struggled to make an impact in the profession?What kind of digital footprint do we leave as we roam the internet and does that leave us open to dangers?And can a video game teach us anything about mental illness? Just some of the questions we explore on this week's Tech Tent.It started with an internal memo from a software engineer protesting about Google's diversity policies, it has turned into a crisis for the company and seen America's culture wars expose divides in Silicon Valley.But at the heart of this debate is the question of why so few women end up developing software for major tech firms.For the long view on this question we turned to Dame Stephanie Shirley, who learned to code in the 1950s. She started her own company in the 1960s - and called herself Steve Shirley as a way of getting through to male clients who, in those sexist days, might not have responded to a business run by a Stephanie.She deliberately employed women as coders and points out that in the early days of computing programming was seen as a female job - ""think of all the coders at Bletchley Park in World War Two"".Dame Stephanie says she's ""disappointed rather than depressed"" by the fact that, while attitudes have changed since the days when a government minister tried to pinch her bottom while negotiating a contract, there is still a major gender imbalance in the technology industry.Amongst the reasons she cites are the fact that tech industry has a very macho aura, and not enough girls are doing science and maths in school.An interesting blogpost from a former Google engineer and manager this week argued that the problem is that many in Silicon Valley have got the wrong idea about what constitutes a great software engineer, seeing it as an occupation for obsessive lone geniuses rather than a collaborative process.""Engineering is not the art of building devices; it's the art of fixing problems,"" wrote Yonatan Zunger. And fixing problems turns out to be all about understanding how people tick, which means successful engineers need the kind of interpersonal skills you may not develop if you rarely emerge from behind your screen.Dame Stephanie Shirley insists that the skills you need to succeed in software development have nothing to do with gender. What is most heartening is to hear how enthusiastic she remains about a career in technology - ""It is such an attractive way of life, I've had such a wonderful life that technology has opened for me"", she tells us.We are used to the idea that film directors and novelists do extensive research and consult experts about the subjects they explore. But as Tameem Antoniades, co-founder of the Cambridge firm Ninja Theory tells us, that has been relatively unusual in the games world.In developing the firm's new title Hellblade, he brought in Cambridge University professor of neuroscience Paul Fletcher to try to make sure that players of the game would have real insights into what it feels like to experience psychosis.The central character Senua has mental health problems brought on by traumatic events. Her personality and the environment in which she operates were developed after advice from Professor Fletcher and from a group of people who had lived through psychosis.""We just had to make sure we understood the subject as best we could,"" says Tameem Antoniades.Senua hears voices, and by using binaural audio which mimics the way we experience sound in the real world, Hellblade makes the hallucinations she suffers seem all the more real.Paul Fletcher is impressed with the final result, and says he had long felt that games could be a useful way of explaining mental illness: ""They offer quite an interesting perspective to a participant - you're not a passive observer you're actively participating in it.""The hope is that Hellblade - as well as being a very immersive work of art - will help change the way we see people going through this kind of illness. The early reviews have been very positive - ""the game often seeks to make you feel frustrated, confused, and helpless"" said one critic, making clear this was a good thing.Games are growing up. They have already shown they can compete commercially with other entertainment industries, and now they are showing that they can also provide as profound an experience as any movie or play.What kind of personal information do we leave lying around on the internet as we roam the web and use social media? And does that leave us open to all sorts of threats - from identity theft to physical harassment?A few weeks ago a security company offered to study my digital footprint to see how much of my data I'd put online. Digital Shadows produced a chunky 30 page report, with a lot of detail about my social media activity, my family and my connections with colleagues.Having been pretty liberal with my use of social media, I found this unsurprising - after all information such as home addresses is pretty easily accessible via the Electoral Register.But James Chappell from Digital Shadows explained that it was important to ""raise the bar"" for potential fraudsters by taking simple steps such as turning off geo-location on photos or asking online directories to remove your details.What concerned me far more was that Digital Shadows managed to find passwords for some of my online accounts, either on the dark web or just dumped in various collections of stolen data.In most cases they had been changed long ago, and some were for accounts I no longer use - but James Chappell warned me they could still be dangerous.He explained that if messages can be sent to your friends which look like they're from you, then people can be duped. And one kind of online account is especially important to protect - ""once you've got someone's email account you can take over their lives digitally.""The stolen data looked like it had come from the hacking of some of the best known firms on the internet, and James pointed out that just about everyone in the Western world who has a presence online was likely to have been affected by those hacks.This week the UK government announced new legislation, mirroring Europe's GDPR, which will allow users to eradicate their personal data from the web.But that is unlikely to help you if that data is held not by a giant corporation but by a group of criminals on the dark web."
technology	Facebook moderation firm Cognizant quits	Hate 'megaphone'	"Cognizant, a professional services firm, is to stop moderating ""objectionable"" content on behalf of Facebook and other internet firms.It follows an investigation by The Verge into working conditions and the mental health of employees working at an Arizona moderation centre on behalf of the social network.Cognizant also has workers in India, Europe and Latin America.It is believed its decision will result in around 6,000 job cuts.The firm told the BBC: ""We have determined that certain content work in our digital operations practice is not in line with our strategic vision for the company and we intend to exit this work over time. This work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client standards - and can involve objectionable materials.""Our other content-related work will continue. In the meantime, we will honour our existing obligations to the small number of clients affected and will transition, over time, as those commitments begin to wind down. In some cases, that may happen over 2020, but some contracts may take longer.""In response, Facebook's Arun Chandra said: ""We respect Cognizant's decision to exit some of its content review services for social media platforms.""Their content reviewers have been invaluable in keeping our platforms safe - and we'll work with our partners during this transition to ensure there's no impact on our ability to review content and keep people safe.""Cognizant's sites in Tampa, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, will be affected but will remain operational until March next year. Facebook plans to increase staff at a centre in Texas, run by a different partner.The social network currently has 15,000 content moderators working around the globe 24 hours a day in 20 review sites. They regularly view images and videos showing depraved content, including child sex abuse, beheadings, torture, rape and murder.The BBC's own investigation into content moderation found one former content moderator was so traumatised by the job she had done that she was unable to trust others and felt ""disgusted by humanity"".Meanwhile, a new report from human rights group Avaaz has highlighted the rise of hate speech in India aimed at the population of Bengali Muslims in the state of Assam. It found posts it regarded as hate speech were shared nearly 100,000 times and viewed at least 5.4 million times.As of September it found that Facebook had removed just 96 of the 213 posts and comments.""Facebook is being used as a megaphone for hate, pointed directly at vulnerable minorities in Assam,"" it concluded.Facebook said in response: ""We have clear rules against hate speech, which we define as attacks against people on the basis of things like caste, nationality, ethnicity and religion, and which reflect input we received from experts in India.""We take this extremely seriously and remove content that violates these policies as soon as we become aware of it. To do this, we have invested in dedicated content reviewers, who have local language expertise and an understanding of India's long-standing historical and social tensions."""
technology	TikTok used by Islamic State to spread propaganda videos	'Pledge allegiance''Malicious behaviour'	"Video-sharing app TikTok is being used by Islamic State militants to spread propaganda to a younger audience, according to the Wall Street Journal.Supporters reportedly shared videos showing IS fighters with guns and corpses being paraded through streets.Some of the videos, posted in recent weeks, are said to have included TikTok augmented-reality effects that stream stars or hearts on top of the content.Videos flagged by the newspaper have been removed and 24 accounts blocked.The videos were identified by the social-media intelligence sharing company Storyful.""This discovery fits with a pattern we've seen over some years of extremist movements successfully colonising and adapting to new social media spaces to reach large audiences,"" Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told the BBC.""TikTok has shown it has the ability and the will to controversially censor themes opposed by the Chinese government.""It is not unreasonable therefore that we should expect it to quickly remove terrorist propaganda.""The video uploads also featured women who call themselves ""jihadist and proud"", according to the Wall Street Journal.In one, people are said to have sung: ""We pledge allegiance till death.""Terrorist and criminal organisations are prohibited from using TikTok.The company, owned by Beijing-headquartered Bytedance, uses thousands of human moderators and artificial-intelligence software to keep harmful content off its platform but the combination does not always work.""Content promoting terrorist organisations has absolutely no place on TikTok,"" it said.""We permanently ban any such accounts and associated devices as soon as identified and we continuously develop ever-stronger controls to proactively detect suspicious activity.""This is an industry-wide challenge complicated by bad actors who actively seek to circumvent protective measures but we have a team dedicated to aggressively protecting against malicious behaviour on TikTok.""Islamic State is well known for using social media platforms Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to spread its message but this appears to be the first time it has targeted TikTok.Last month, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on his followers to double their efforts after the group lost control of parts of Syria and Iraq."
technology	Budget 2017: Funding for AI, 5G and digital skills	Tech spending highlights	"Chancellor Philip Hammond said he wanted to secure Britain's position as a world leader in technology and innovation as he delivered his Budget.It included more money for artificial intelligence and the development of 5G networks.There will also be funding to put driverless cars on UK roads by 2021.The chancellor also pledged to boost digital skills, including tripling the number of trained computer science teachers to 12,000.""A new tech business is founded in Britain every hour, and I want that to be every half hour,"" said Mr Hammond.Although the chancellor described the UK as a ""world leader"" in cutting-edge technology, there is evidence it is losing its place on the world stage.A new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report suggests the UK is in decline, both in terms of top-cited scientific research and artificial intelligence inventions.According to the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, the UK accounted for 1.9% of AI-related patent applications from 2010 to 2015.The research suggests 70% of AI technological development is happening in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China.The AI funding announced by the Treasury will support start-ups and raise the number of new PhD students in the field to 200 each year.It is also thought some of the money will go towards an advisory body to remove barriers to AI development.Darren Roos, president of the cloud division of technology company SAP, welcomed the funding announcement but questioned whether it would be enough.""Let's be clear, this pledge from the government today is a step in the right direction but the UK is in a global race when it comes to the adoption of AI technology, and it cannot afford to lose.""While today's pledge is an excellent start, other countries are investing far more in AI.""The need to increase digital skills in the UK, both in schools and among the existing workforce, is seen by many as a key strategy for the government.It has faced criticism recently as it was revealed that most UK secondary schools did not offer a GCSE in computer science.""We're delighted to see the emphasis on digital skills in the Budget and welcome the chancellor's commitment to ensuring that young people receive the investment needed to thrive in the jobs of the future,"" said Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, which runs a series of digital skills initiatives.""As a country, we need to build on our strengths as a tech leader and ensure that we don't just cope with the challenges ahead but that we inspire, lead and shape the future,"" he said."
technology	Facebook's Zuckerberg grilled over ad fact-checking policy	What did he say about Libra?What did other panel members say?	"US lawmakers have sharply criticised Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg about the firm's policy not to fact check political ads.In a hearing in Washington, the social network chief was accused of letting political disinformation spread ahead of the 2020 US presidential election.He also was unable to confirm if hate speech from candidates running for office would be taken off the platform.But he did say it was not his job to police what politicians said.The tech boss was appearing before the House Financial Services Committee to defend plans for his embattled digital currency Libra.But he found himself under attack over host of other issues, including failing to stop child exploitation on the social network and the Cambridge Analytic data scandal.On the social network's policy on political ads, Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked: ""I just want to know how far I can push this... could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?""The Green New Deal is a Democrat policy fiercely opposed by most Republicans.Mr Zuckerberg said the platform would take down posts from anyone, including politicians, that called for violence or tried to suppress voter participation.As for untruths, however, he said it was not Facebook's role to prevent ""people in an election from seeing that you had lied"".In another example, Democrat Sean Casten asked if Facebook would remove hate speech in political ads. He noted a former member of the American Nazi Party had run for Congress and won a Republican primary in 2018.Mr Zuckerberg said: ""Congressman, I think that depends on a bunch of specifics that I'm not familiar with this case and can't answer to.""""Well, that's rather shocking,"" said Mr Casten. ""I don't think that's a hard question.""The chief executive was also asked whether Facebook would remove ads that falsely claimed immigrants who participated in the US census would have their details shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook was in the process of revising its related policies, adding that he could not yet say what the ""specifics"" would be.Mr Zuckerberg also tried to reassure sceptical US lawmakers about the safety of his proposed digital currency Libra, but was given short shrift by most.The project has faced a series of challenges recently, with key partner organisations having pulled out and mounting regulatory opposition.Members of Congress raised concerns about whether currency could be used for money laundering, disrupt the global financial system, or give Facebook too much control over data.Mr Zuckerberg said he was determined to persevere with the plan, arguing it could help more than a billion adults without a bank account worldwide.But he added: ""I get that I'm not the ideal messenger for this right now. We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I'm sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this.""Grilling or roasting?As is often the case when Mark Zuckerberg is in Congress, the agenda deviated from the subject at hand.One exchange stood out. Ann Wagner, a Republican congresswoman for Missouri, said that Facebook's plan to introduce end-to-end encryption on its Messenger app would make it harder for authorities to discover instances of images of child sexual abuse being shared.That matters: 12 million such images were shared on Facebook last year. It appears to be by far the biggest platform for that kind of illegal material sharing.While other services, like WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage, are encrypted, experts in child safety say the main Facebook platform is of greater concern when it comes to paedophiles searching for, finding, and grooming children - all on the same platform.""What are you doing to shut this down?"" Ms Wagner demanded to know.Mr Zuckerberg cited tools developed by Facebook to detect the material, but eventually admitted: ""It will be harder to find some of this behaviour.""He'll need to find better answers - or face a scandal that may well dwarf all the others.Many lawmakers questioned why they should trust Mr Zuckerberg's assurances over Libra, given the social network's past failings in other areas.Maxine Waters, the Democratic chairwoman of the panel, pointed out that the social network was the subject of an antitrust investigation. She said it had ""allowed"" Russia to interfere with the US election in 2016.""It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,"" she said.Mr Zuckerberg's personal integrity also came in for attack, with Democrat Madeleine Dean saying: ""We earn credibility drop by drop, but we pour it away in buckets.""Some however defended the Facebook boss's track record as an entrepreneur.""I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of big tech,"" said Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel.""But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation."""
technology	Amazon Echo and Google Home owners spied on by apps		"Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers have been compromised by apps modified to spy on users after being approved by the technology companies.Berlin-based Security Research Labs (SRL) built the eight ""smart spies"", which were promoted as a way to deliver horoscopes and generate random numbers.Once approved, the researchers updated the Echo Skills and Home Actions to eavesdrop and steal passwords.They then alerted the US companies, which blocked the software.""Smart spies undermine the assumption that voice apps are only active as long as they are in dialogue with the user,"" Karsten Nohl, SRL's chief scientist, told BBC News.Creating them had been a fairly easy process that required relatively little programming experience, he said.They were activated when a user said something like: ""Alexa, turn on my horoscopes,"" or: ""OK Google, ask My Lucky Horoscope to give me the horoscope for Taurus.""When the user tried to turn off the app, they heard a ""Goodbye"" message but the software carried on running for several more seconds rather than deactivating immediately.If, in that time, the person said a phrase including the word ""I"" or other chosen terms, their speech was transcribed and sent back to SRL.One giveaway something was not right was the smart-speaker light remained turned on, indicating it was still listening, according to Mr Nohl.And, he suggested, this should be something smart-speaker owners kept an eye on.A variation of the attack involved the app saying: ""An important security update is available for your device. Please say, 'Start update,' followed by your password.""Anything the user said after the word ""Start"" was then sent back to the developer.""Users should be very suspicious when any smart speaker asks for a password, which no regular app is supposed to do,"" Mr Nohl added.David Emm, a security analyst at Kaspersky Lab, said people needed to remember some of the apps offered for Amazon Echo and Google Home devices were made by third parties.""We all need to be aware of the capabilities of these devices,"" he said.""They're 'smart listeners', not just smart speakers. Their capabilities extend to apps that we use with them.""Google said it had removed SRL's Actions.""We are putting additional mechanisms in place to prevent these issues from occurring in the future,"" the company added.Amazon said: ""Customer trust is important to us and we conduct security reviews as part of the skill certification process.""We quickly blocked the Skill in question and put mitigations in place to prevent and detect this type of Skill behaviour and reject or take them down when identified."""
technology	Mild panic greets Trump digital transition		"Much is written about the Herculean effort to move one family out of the White House and a new family in within the space of just a few hours.But in our modern age, the digital moving trucks must also roar into action, as prime presidential online real estate gets a makeover, and eight years of President Obama's social media chat is confined to the national archives.Let’s start with WhiteHouse.gov, the official website for the President, which as of noon Friday, has a brand new look - and has already provoked mild panic.Many noted that pages about climate change were swiftly deleted. So too were pages about LGBT rights and various science policies.But, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Pages about everything were deleted as what was essentially Obama’s homepage was replaced with Trump’s.That means posts about any former policy positions no longer exist on the White House website if you follow the original links.So while the web address pointing to the White House’s position on climate change no longer works, the same can be said about Obama’s pages relating to the economy. Unpredictable as he is, no-one is suggesting Donald Trump is about to describe “money” as a hoax.That said, on the new whitehouse.gov, a search for “military” will yield 154 results. “Climate change”? None.Nervous internet sleuths have found one reference to climate change, a promise to lift the ""harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rules"".Make of that what you will. People on Twitter certainly are.Also wiped clean was the White House's petition website. On Friday, by 4pm in DC, only two petitions were posted on the site. The first demanded the release of the President's tax returns. The other demanded he put his businesses in a blind trust. If either petition gets 100,000 signatures, the White House has to provide a response - at least, that was the rule the previous administration set itself.From @POTUS to @POTUS44Speaking of which, it’s all change on Twitter too.From today @POTUS - President of the United States - has been taken over by the Trump team. All previous tweets from Obama’s team - and Obama himself - have been deleted from that account, but archived under @POTUS44. The 44 relating of course to the fact Obama was the 44th US President.The tweets were not, as a smattering of people blurted out, “deleted by Trump” once he had control of the account.Twitter removed them - and that's because scrubbing the account of Obama’s tweets is a smart move for everyone involved. Had Twitter left the old tweets in place you’ll find yourself seeing people retweeting Obama’s words but with Trump’s identity attached, a recipe for misinformation disaster.Trump’s first tweet on @POTUS posted a picture and a link to his inaugural address - the full text of which was posted on Facebook. Is Trump having a change of heart over his social network of choice?Maybe. Facebook certainly offers the chance to speak more clearly at length, and, as the leader of the free world, it would be more useful to post to an audience of almost two billion rather than Twitter’s rather limited 300m.We won’t know for sure until about 3am, DC time, tomorrow morning. Everyone will be surely waiting for those twilight hours to see if the President springs back into life posting his thoughts on his own personal account, @realDonaldTrump.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook"
technology	'I use Snapchat to sell sexual videos'	Hurtful comments'Future careers ruined'	"Snapchat is being used to sell explicit images and videos online, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. Jodie says she makes £4,000 a month on the app, but it's not without a cost to her personal life, and she has been subject to online abuse.""It's like a proper business,"" the 26-year-old says.""It's like people that sing, or go and gig, or artists that sell their own paintings. I'm just selling pictures and videos of me.""Jodie refers to herself as a ""Snapchat Premium girl"".For a monthly fee - of between £20 and £200 - she sends her subscribers sexually explicit photos and videos via the regular Snapchat app.Such material is banned and removed when found, Snapchat says, but Jodie has been doing it since 2016.She advertises her service on other social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and says she is careful to check the accounts belong to real people before accepting.But it has also led to her receiving many hurtful comments - sent online from those who object to what she does for a living.They contain offensive language.""People call me 'slut' and things like that. And it does upset me,"" she explains.Within 20 minutes of filming with the Victoria Derbyshire programme, she receives a message from a man she has never spoken to before that reads: ""You are a hoe though. You're gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but shame you sell your body or pictures. No morals unfortunately in this world.""Jodie explains: ""I get a message like that every hour, or every half an hour, all day long.""Tonight my friend will say, 'How did filming go?'... and then I'll break down.""But,"" she reflects, ""I was miserable in my office job, and I love the money.""Maintaining her Snapchat has now become her full-time job, she explains, often because her 40 or so subscribers demand extra material.Content can range from a striptease to videos of her masturbating.Lawyers say no laws are being broken by those selling such content, unless they do so to under-18s or upload especially depraved material.But as a result of the Victoria Derbyshire programme showing Instagram its findings, that social media site has now blocked all hashtags associated with Premium Snapchat that were being used by people to advertise their services.Snapchat said in a statement it does not allow ""pornographic content to be promoted or distributed"".""Accounts that privately distribute pornographic content are an intentional abuse of the terms of service of our platform,"" it added in a statement.""We remove them when reported.""Jodie sees Snapchat as a safe environment to make money, as she says she never needs to meet her clients.""I'm not an escort. I've been offered thousands of pounds to meet men and I say 'no',"" she explains.But she admits it has also taken a toll on her personal life.She has not had a boyfriend for months and says many men judge her.""They don't really want to date me after [I tell them my job]. Or they do, but for the wrong reasons,"" she says.And she admits her family is concerned about the long-term implications.Jodie allows her subscribers who pay her £200 a month to save the material she sends them to their phones.It means she loses control of the content, and does not know how it will be used.Laura Higgins, who founded the Revenge Porn Helpline, argues more protections are needed.She says the charity receives regular calls from people like Jodie, who have been blackmailed or had their future careers ruined by the resurfacing of sexual content they originally sold online.And she says the videos they produce can even go on to be used by others for sextortion - luring men to send explicit pictures of themselves to what they think is a good-looking woman, and then blackmailing them.A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it expected ""online platforms to... ensure the services they offer are age appropriate"".It added: ""Working with tech companies, children's charities and other stakeholders, we are developing new laws to help make the UK the safest place in the world to be online.""Jodie explains she will continue selling material on Snapchat ""until it's not convenient for me any more"".She says the money - four times what she earned before - makes it worth it, having struggled to afford to feed herself two years ago.And it allows her to live a flexible lifestyle.But she does not hide the downsides.""When [sexualised comments are] the only attention you're getting as a woman, it can make you feel quite worthless,"" she says.""All I get is like, 'show me your boobs' or 'I want to see you in underwear now', or 'you're dirty, you're filthy'.""I sometimes cry. It's very upsetting, because I don't actually get any nice attention.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."

technology	Google and BBC scrap VR projects		"The BBC has disbanded the team it created to make virtual reality (VR) content, saying its funding has ended.It comes as Google halts sales of its Daydream View headsets, admitting it does not see a future for smartphone-based VR.There have been questions over the long-term future for the technology which has failed to become a mass market product.One analyst said it could be several years before VR lived up to its hype.In a statement, the BBC said: ""The VR Hub had funding for two years so is now wrapping up its production and commissioning.""It's been an important part of our charter commitment to promote technological innovation and maintain a leading role in research and development which benefits the whole industry.""The team was set up in November 2017 and has created VR films across news, comedy, drama and history. Its closure was announced in a blog post.According to research firm IHS Markit, there will be 51 million consumer headsets in use around the world by 2023.""Compared to mobile devices, this represents a niche audience so it is understandable the BBC is reconsidering its VR content strategy,"" said analyst Piers Harding-Rolls.But he added: ""With the introduction of volumetric video and 5G networks capable of providing distribution, VR video content is expected to become more compelling, but we are several years away from realising that vision.""Speaking about its decision to abandon Daydream, Google said it had initially seen a lot of potential in smartphone VR.""But over time, we noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution. Most notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction,"" it said in a statement.""There also hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we've seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset. While we are no longer selling Daydream View or supporting Daydream on Pixel 4, the Daydream app and store will remain available for existing users.""It added that it was investing heavily in AR (Augmented Reality) experiences that use smartphone cameras to bridge the digital and physical worlds.Mr Harding-Rolls was not surprised by its decision. ""Daydream VR underperformed from launch and did not get the wider industry support that was expected. The decision will have a minimal impact on the consumer VR market, where the agenda is being set by Oculus/Facebook in the standalone space, and Sony in the console segment,"" he said."

I think businesses might pay for it, but people are so used to having news at their fingertips for free."""
technology	Facebook removes 11.6 million child abuse posts	AnalysisBy Angus Crawford, BBC News correspondent	"Facebook has released the latest figures in its efforts to remove harmful content from its platforms.They reveal 11.6 million pieces of content related to child nudity and child sexual exploitation were taken down between July and September 2019.For the first time, Facebook is also releasing figures for Instagram and including numbers for posts related to suicide and self-harm.This follows a public outcry over the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.The teenager killed herself in 2017 and her father then found large amounts of graphic material about self-harm and suicide on her Instagram account.In a blog, Facebook vice-president Guy Rosen said: ""We remove content that depicts or encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behaviour.""We place a sensitivity screen over content that doesn't violate our policies but that may be upsetting to some, including things like healed cuts or other non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery.""The figures, in Facebook's fourth Community Standards Enforcement Report, reveal that between July and September 2019:Facebook said it had removed more than 99% of the content associated with al-Qaeda, the Islamic State group and their affiliates.And for other terrorist organisations this proportion was 98.5% for Facebook and 92.2% for Instagram.Overall, the figures suggest Facebook is removing ever larger quantities of harmful content.From January to March 2019, for example, it took down 5.8 million pieces of content related to child nudity and sexual exploitation of children.But future efforts to clamp down on harmful content could be hampered by the social network's self-styled ""pivot to privacy"", announced by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, in part in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The end-to-end encryption on Facebook-owned WhatsApp will be extended to Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with Mr Zuckerberg acknowledging there would be a ""trade-off"" that would benefit child sex abusers and other criminals.Facebook, it seems, is still playing catch-up in two very important areas.Instagram, the junior partner, bought back in 2012 for $1bn (£0.8bn), now seems to be leading policy changes at Facebook around content about self-harm and suicide.Molly Russell's father, Ian, led calls for Instagram to reform - and, to be fair, it has made a start, banning images, pictures and even cartoons, that encourage or promote self-injury, so no more razor blades, bottles of pills or nooses.Already that kind of thing is harder to find on Instagram than it was a year ago.So what do we now hear from Instagram's parent company, Facebook?For the first time, it is revealing how much of that kind of depressing, graphic damaging material it has been taking down, on both platforms - a little late some might think.The second area is around child abuse material. In the third quarter of 2018, Facebook removed 8.7 million pieces of content related to child nudity and child sexual exploitation.In the same period this year, that figure had risen to 11.6 million.Now, either Facebook is doing an even better job of detection than before - or it has lost control of the problem.After all, it is not as though the company is new to this issue - it has been a member of the Internet Watch Foundation, which actively hunts for this kind of content, for more than a decade.It has also been using sophisticated search-and-takedown software, such as Microsoft PhotoDNA, since 2011.But still the images of child sexual abuse keep coming, in ever greater quantities.And what is heading down the track? Mr Zuckerberg's plans to introduce encrypted messaging on the apps - which at a stroke throws an invisibility cloak over all communications.Facebook may not be able to see what you've sent, but, possibly, nor will PhotoDNA or, crucially, the police."
technology	Facebook reveals privacy flaw in Groups		"Facebook says it has discovered a new privacy flaw on its platform that lets some app developers access data in Groups that they should not have.The social network restricted how much information app developers could gather from Groups, following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it said about 100 developers had retained access to Group data, such as people's names and photos.Facebook did not say how many members had been affected by the flaw.""We can be in little doubt that there are groups out there that seek to abuse these kinds of flaws to artificially shape debate, manipulate voters and influence election results,"" Mike Beck from the cyber-security company Darktrace told the BBC.Like other social networks, Facebook provides an application programming interface (API) that lets app developers connect their own creations to Facebook.But in 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of people by creating a personality quiz on Facebook - and used the data to target political advertising.In October, Facebook agreed to pay a £500,000 fine imposed by the UK's data protection watchdog, for its role in the scandal.Following the scandal, Facebook restricted access to many of its APIs, including the one that let app developers connect to Groups on the social network.With permission, app developers could access a group's name, the number of members and the content of posts.However, they could only access member names and photos if people explicitly opted in.But on Tuesday, the company revealed that about 100 ""partners"" retained access following the change.It said ""at least"" 11 developers had accessed the restricted information in the last 60 days.""Although we've seen no evidence of abuse, we will ask them to delete any member data they may have retained, and we will conduct audits to confirm that it has been deleted,"" Facebook said in a statement."
technology	Facebook bans political ad posted by ex-Downing Street aide	'Provide clarity'	"Facebook has removed an advert from a tax campaign group for breaking its rules on political advertising.The Fair Tax Campaign, run by a former Boris Johnson aide, has been running an ad with the message ""could you afford an extra £214 each month?""It claims that this is what Labour's tax plans would mean for everyone.Labour is yet to publish its tax plans or manifesto for the 12 December general election.But Shadow chancellor John McDonnell this weekend said that if it won the election, the party only planned to increase income tax for the top 5% of earners to help fund increased public spending.""In terms of income tax, we've said very clearly the top 5% will pay a bit more, 95% of the earners will be protected,"" he told the BBC.A Labour spokesman called the banned Facebook ad ""fake news"" and said it was right that it had been swiftly removed.The Fair Tax Campaign is run by Alex Crowley, a former aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Crowley left Downing Street in late September.He told the BBC the ad made a ""legitimate charge"" that was based on a New Economic Foundation Report from August this year. He said the campaign had no links with the Conservative Party.The message in the ad says ""sponsored"" but does not reveal who has paid for it. Under Facebook's rules, political advertisers have to register with the social media firm and every advert has to show who has paid for it.Facebook removed the ad after being contacted by the BBC.The company said it should have carried a ""paid for by"" disclaimer and the advertiser has been contacted ""to provide clarity"" on its policies relating to ads about politics, elections and social issues.The Fair Tax Campaign will be able to switch the ad back on if they register and insert the ""paid for by"" disclaimer.In the meantime the advert can be seen in Facebook's Ad Library, with a message explaining why it has been removed.The group says on Facebook that it believes Labour's tax plans must never be allowed to happen and calls on voters to oppose them in the 12 December general election.Three Facebook users contacted the BBC to say they had been shown the advert. They were responding to a crowd-sourcing initiative designed to reveal how the different parties are targeting paid adverts during the UK election campaign.Facebook has come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic over its policy of not policing misinformation in political adverts.Boss Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly defended the policy, insisting that free expression must be his company's priority.As the UK general election campaign gets underway, the social media platform is bound to be a vital campaigning arena, indeed it is likely to be the principal focus for party spending.That means it will be vital to know just who is being targeted with which ads - so if you receive any in your Facebook feed over the coming weeks, do let us know!

technology	Facebook agrees to pay Cambridge Analytica fine to UK		"Facebook has agreed to pay a £500,000 fine imposed by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.It had originally appealed the penalty, causing the Information Commissioner's Office to pursue its own counter-appeal.As part of the agreement, Facebook has made no admission of liability.The US firm said it ""wished it had done more to investigate Cambridge Analytica"" earlier.James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of the ICO said: ""The ICO's main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy.""Harry Kinmonth, a Facebook lawyer, noted that the social network had made changes to restrict the information app developers could access following the scandal.""The ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica,"" he added.""However, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO's wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.""Researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people.Some of this data was shared with London-based Cambridge Analytica.The ICO argued that Facebook did not do enough to protect users' information."
technology	Facebook's partners yet to commit money to Libra		"None of the 20 firms partnering with Facebook on its Libra cryptocurrency project have yet committed to financially backing the effort, the BBC understands.Facebook said in June the founding partners would be expected to each inject $10m, but so far no agreement has been made, and the fee was not discussed at the Libra Association’s first general assembly last week, according to several sources.Mark Zuckerberg is expected to tell a Congressional hearing on Wednesday that Libra is “independent” and “we don’t control it”.The Libra Association declined to comment. It would not say if it currently had any financial support from any source other than Facebook itself.Set up by Facebook to govern the Libra cryptocurrency, the Association was officially formed on 14 October, days after several high-profile payments firms abandoned the project, citing fears over security, and political pressure.Now the Association is in place, Facebook has said its influence is restricted as the other 20 members have an equal say over its actions. Facebook’s David Marcus was elected as one of Libra’s five board members. Members elected Bertrand Perez, formerly of PayPal, as Libra’s chairman.‘China is moving quickly'But Mr Zuckerberg has once again been summoned to the US capitol to address concerns from lawmakers over the potential for the Libra currency to be abused, or negatively disrupt the global financial order.According to the written testimony submitted to the House Financial Services committee, Mr Zuckerberg will say: “We want to be clear: Facebook will not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all regulators approve it.""And we support [the Libra Association] delaying its launch until it has fully-addressed US regulatory concerns.""The statement would mark the first time the company has made an on-the-record pledge to lawmakers to only move ahead if US regulators are satisfied. The company had initially refused to rule out making that move when repeatedly pressed on the issue by the BBC in July, the last time Congress held a hearing to discuss the project.Politicians in the US, as well as other countries, are concerned about Facebook’s involvement, coming as it does after a sustained period of data privacy violations. But Mr Zuckerberg is expected to reiterate his view that if the firm is not allowed to press ahead with Libra, the US risked ceding power to China.“While we debate these issues,” he is expected to say, “the rest of the world isn’t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months.”He will add: “If American doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”The warning follows a speech the Facebook founder made in Washington DC last week, in which he criticised censorship on Chinese-owned app TikTok. “Is that the internet that we want?” he said.‘Still a challenge'Mr Zuckerberg is, however, aware that Facebook’s reputational crisis is an obstacle Libra needs to overcome if it’s to ever earn Washington’s blessing.“I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now,” Mr Zuckerberg will say at Wednesday’s hearing. ""We’ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.”Until it achieves financial autonomy, the assertion that the Libra Association is an independent organisation will be put in question.One source at a partner company told the BBC: “We’ve seen Facebook start to move away from the Association a little bit, maybe, but it’s still a challenge for them, definitely.”Libra Association companies told the BBC that no timeline for implementing the $10m fee had been set - but all said they would likely invest in the project when asked.“Rather than collect a bunch of money from a bunch of people and then figure it out,” one said, ""the feeling is that we needed to form, ratify a budget, and then figure out how to fund that budget, rather than the other way around.”_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Facebook chief rules out banning political adverts	China banMisleading ads'New tobacco'	"Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he does not think it is right for a company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.He was giving a speech in Washington DC following weeks of criticism over the firm's decision not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods.He added he had considered barring all political ads on his platforms.But he said he believed the move would favour incumbent politicians and whoever the media chose to cover.And Mr Zuckerberg said that even if he had supported the idea, it was not clear where his firm would draw the line.Instead, he said, he had decided the company should ""err on the side of greater expression"".""We're at another crossroads,"" he said.""We can either continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. Or we can decide that the cost is simply temporary.""The future depends on all of us,"" he added.""And whether you like it or not. I think we need to recognise what is at stake, and come together to stand for voice and free expression at this critical moment.""Mr Zuckerberg referenced Martin Luther King Jr's imprisonment in Birmingham Jail, Alabama as an example of a previous backlash against free expression.But the comparison drew criticism from the late civil rights campaigner's daughter, who said that disinformation spread by politicians had helped lead to her father's murder.The speech was delivered at Georgetown University in Washington DC, after which the audience was invited to ask questions. However the question-and-answer section was not broadcast on a livestream provided to the public.During his talk, Mr Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to make a dig at Chinese rival TikTok, which he said was censoring news of political protests.And he suggested that his thwarted attempts to bring Facebook and Instagram to mainland China had worked out for the best.""I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought maybe we can help create a more open society,"" he explained.""But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there there, and they never let us in.""And now, we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.""The event came three days after it emerged that since July, the Facebook chief executive had hosted private dinners at several of his homes to which he had invited conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican politician. These social events followed claims that the firm had shown bias against the right.Facebook has also recently been attacked on the left, by two of the leading candidates in the contest to be the Democratic Party's candidate for the 2020 presidential election.Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren paid to run an intentionally misleading advert on its platform that claimed Mark Zuckerberg had personally endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.She said she had done so in protest against the firm's decision to allow politicians to run ads containing"" known lies"".""When profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit,"" she claimed.A spokesman for Joe Biden had previously criticised the firm for refusing to remove a video posted by Donald Trump's re-election campaign which promoted an unproven conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and his son.""It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform,"" Mr Biden's press secretary said.Mr Zuckerberg has also faced recent criticism from some of his Silicon Valley peers.On Wednesday, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff described Facebook as being the ""new cigarettes - it's addictive, bad for us, and our kids are being drawn in"".He also said that the company should be broken up to prevent it gathering so much data on the public.""Why they can't say that trust is our highest value is beyond me,"" he added.Apple's Tim Cook has also criticised Facebook in the past. He has claimed it lets people's personal data be patched together and used against them, and suggested that its cryptocurrency plans go beyond the bounds of where private companies should operate.However, he has done so without mentioning the social media's firm by name.I think Mark Zuckerberg may have prepared by watching Barack Obama's speeches.The Facebook chief gave emphasis to his key points by delivering them in short bursts.""At least we can... disagree!""""That's what freedom of expression...is!""I could almost hear the 44th president's accent.There was a time, of course, when we thought Mr Zuckerberg fancied himself as a future president. But if it's no longer likely he'll lead the US, he perhaps sees a chance to lead on a defining issue: the changing nature of free expression.Progressive regimes in history, he noted, have allowed more speech, not less. And, in what will play well in the corridors of western power, he repeated his view that restricting what people say on the internet - he meant Facebook - could cede power of the internet to China's tech giants rather than Silicon Valley's.I often flip between thinking Mr Zuckerberg is right to say Facebook should take a light-touch approach to limiting what people can post, and seeing a chief executive who is reneging on a responsibility to fix his creation.Ultimately, I believe, a big part of the problem isn't that people use Facebook to express themselves, but that it then tends to amplify the most outrageous, divisive content.Even so, Mark Zuckerberg has achieved some important things today. First, he's clearly and openly asked for help.And second, he's elevated the current debate on online speech into one of historical importance, a ""crossroads"" in line with the American civil rights struggle.A hero of that movement, Congressman Elijah Cummings, died on Thursday - and Mr Zuckerberg paid tribute.Cummings was a legendary advocate of free speech - but also a man who called loudly for Mr Zuckerberg to get his house in order."
technology	Facebook puts on brave face with Libra	Another drop-outSearch on for CEO	After five major payments providers pulled out last week, Facebook’s Libra currency project looked to be on the rocks.But the remaining members have insisted it’s full steam ahead.The 21 founding companies in the Libra Association - down from 28 when the project was first announced - met for the first time in Geneva on Monday.A spokesman told the BBC he believed the currency was still on track to launch next year.But, he added, it would only do so if suitable regulatory approval had been granted.It comes after a stern warning from the G7 group of nations that Libra risked disrupting the global financial order.That concern followed a letter to payments providers from US senators Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown, sent on 8 October, that threatened “a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities”.Libra Association spokesman Dante Disparte criticised the senators, telling the BBC the letter “stifles private market innovation”.“At some level it confounds the regulatory process and the law-making process of free market economies,” Mr Disparte said in a phone call on Monday.The interference created a “problematic precedent for the state of private sector innovation”, he added.Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay, PayPal and Mercado Pago were the six firms that dropped out ahead of Monday’s meeting. On Monday morning, it was revealed that Booking Holdings - the firm behind Booking.com - had also pulled out.The remaining 21 members all confirmed their commitment to the project at the Geneva meeting. Among them are rideshare firms Uber and Lyft, prominent venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, music streaming service Spotify, and the sales and services arm of telecoms company Vodafone.Netherlands-based PayU is the only remaining member operating in the online payments processing sector.“We believe that the design of the Libra ecosystem has the potential to address a number of societal needs,” a PayU spokesperson said, in a statement sent out by the Libra Association.Of the 21 companies, representatives from five of the firms were elected to form the Libra Association’s board, with Facebook’s David Marcus among them. Bertrand Perez, a former senior director at PayPal, was appointed chief operating officer and interim managing director.The board would soon set up a search committee to appoint a permanent chief executive, Mr Disparte said.He added that many more firms were interested in joining the association.“More than 1,500 organisations have expressed an interest in joining this effort,” Mr Disparte said.“Even though aspects of that have been difficult in the last few months.”In response to mounting concerns, Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been called to appear before a congressional panel on 23 October to discuss Libra, and likely other issues involving his firm._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Payments giants abandon Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency		"Mastercard, Visa, eBay and payments firm Stripe have pulled out of Facebook’s embattled cryptocurrency project, Libra.Their move, first reported in the Financial Times, follows the withdrawal of PayPal, announced last week.It represents a huge blow to the social network’s plans to launch what it envisions as a global currency.The project has drawn heavy scrutiny from regulators and politicians, particularly in the US.Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will appear before the House Committee on Financial Services on 23 October to discuss Libra and its planned roll-out.Regulators have raised multiple concerns over Libra, including the risk it may be used for money laundering.Mercado Pago, a payments firm serving mostly Latin America, also pulled out. It means of the six payments-related firms first involved in Libra, just one, PayU, remains. Netherlands-based PayU did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Friday.In a statement released on Friday, eBay said it “respected” the Libra project.“However, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay’s managed payments experience for our customers.”A spokesperson for Stripe said the firm supported the aim of making global payments easier.""Libra has this potential. We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.”A spokesperson for Visa said: ""We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.""The Libra Association, set up by Facebook to manage the project, said of the departing companies: ""We appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project.""Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.""We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.”Facebook's executive in charge of its Libra effort wrote on Twitter that losing the firms was ""liberating"".""I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,"" wrote David Marcus, who before joining Facebook was PayPal's president.""Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up.""Last week, PayPal said it would no longer be part of the Libra Association, but did not rule out working on the project in future - prompting a strong reaction from the Association.""Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else,"" it said in a statement.

technology	Facebook will not fact-check politicians		"Facebook says it will treat all posts by politicians as ""newsworthy content"" that should ""be seen and heard"".The company said politicians would be exempt from its fact-checking scheme which is designed to reduce the spread of fake news and misinformation.It said it did not want to be the ""referee"" in political debates or prevent politicians' posts from reaching their intended audience.However, it did not define who it counted as a politician.On Tuesday, Facebook's vice president of communications - the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg - gave a speech in Washington DC.He said the company had ""made mistakes in 2016"" and said Russia had tried to use Facebook to interfere with the US presidential election.He insisted the company had taken steps to prevent it happening again.Facebook uses independent third-party fact-checking organisations to help identity fake news, misleading claims and misinformation.However, it said posts made by politicians would not be fact-checked.Sir Nick also said Facebook would let politicians post content that breaks its rules on topics such as hate speech, as long as they did not pose a significant ""risk of harm"".But advertisements on Facebook must still abide by the rules.Sir Nick said Facebook's role was to ""make sure there is a level playing field, not to be a political participant ourselves"".The BBC asked Facebook company who it would consider to be a ""politician"".The social network said it did not put ""strict parameters"" on its definition of a politician because of global differences.However, it told the BBC that the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson would remain banned, even though he stood as a candidate in the European elections in May.It said he had been banned under the site's ""dangerous organisations and individuals"" policy, and that the ban would remain in place.In the same speech given by Sir Nick on Tuesday, he urged politicians not to break up Facebook into smaller companies."
technology	Facebook can be ordered to remove posts worldwide	What was the case about?What does this mean in practice?	"Facebook and similar apps and websites can be ordered to take down illegal posts worldwide after a landmark ruling from the EU's highest court.Platforms may also have to seek out similar examples of the illegal content and remove them, instead of waiting for each to be reported.One expert said it was a significant ruling with global implications.Facebook said the judgement raised ""critical questions around freedom of expression"".The case stemmed from an insulting comment posted on Facebook about Austrian politician Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, which the country's courts said damaged her reputation.Under EU law, Facebook and other platforms are not held responsible for illegal content posted by users, until they have been made aware of it - at which point, they must remove it quickly.But it was unclear whether an EU directive, saying platforms cannot be made to monitor all posts or actively seek out illegal activity, could be overridden by a court order.Austria's Supreme Court asked Europe's highest court to clarify this.Thursday's ruling says three things:Facebook is unable to appeal against this ruling.""If there's a court order to say that someone's been defamed, then Facebook has to also search for different variations of it,"" Prof Steve Peers, from the University of Essex, told BBC News.Privacy campaigner Max Schrems added that the ruling could have implications for Facebook's closed groups.In the past, the social network had required users to identify each instance of a post they wanted to be taken down before the firm would tackle them. But since some of its pages are members-only, the victim might not be able to access them all.Now, the onus would be on Facebook to find them, Mr Schrems suggested.Facebook has said countries would have to ""set out very clear definitions on what 'identical' and 'equivalent' means in practice"".It said the ruling ""undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country"".However, platforms can be compelled to take down posts worldwide within the framework of relevant international laws only.""There's no harmonised defamation law internationally,"" said Prof Peers.""Facebook might say we can't do this to the United States, because even though it infringes Austrian law, it doesn't infringe US law."""
technology	Facebook to create VR world called Horizon	Stopping support	"Facebook is creating an immersive environment called Horizon to tempt people into spending more time in virtual reality.The VR app will be a mix of social places where users can mingle and chat, and other areas where they can play games against each other.People will inhabit and explore the virtual spaces via a cartoon avatar.The app will be made available and tested in early 2020, by a small group of Facebook users.Details about Horizon and early footage of the virtual space were shown off at Facebook's Oculus Connect 6 developer conference this week.Facebook said anyone using Horizon would be able to call on human ""guides"" to help them navigate and become more familiar with the virtual environment.The guides will not be ""moderators"" who will police behaviour, said Facebook. It added that it would include tools that let people manage how they interact with other users.It will also have options that let people shape and build their own part of the environment. They will also be able to design their own avatars.The entire space has been given a cartoon-like feel as it is intended to be used on Facebook's Oculus Quest headset, which does not have the high resolution graphics of PC-linked headsets.Sam Machkovech, a reporter for Ars Technica, who has tried Horizon, said Facebook had put ""a ton of work"" into the version he saw, to make it as welcoming as possible.But he noted that Horizon was ""yet another"" combination of apps, chat and avatars which Facebook had produced in just a few years. He suggested that it was still searching for a good combination that proved properly tempting to users.""We're still waiting for Facebook to inspire confidence that it will launch a social-VR app and stick with it for more than two years,"" he wrote.Anyone interested in joining Horizon can sign up to be an early tester.The creation of Horizon means Facebook will shut down its current VR hang-outs - Facebook Spaces and Oculus Rooms. Both will close on 25 October.Facebook's expansion of VR comes as Samsung cuts some support for the tech.Samsung said it was dropping support for its Gear VR technology in its Galaxy Note 10 smartphones. Neither the Note 10 nor the Note 10 Plus will be compatible with the Gear VR system.Samsung's phone-based VR uses a headset into which a smartphone slots, to produce the immersive experience. Industry experts suggest that interest in phone-based VR systems such as Gear VR will decline as standalone devices, like the Oculus Quest, become more widely available.In a statement given to tech news site the Verge, Samsung said it was ""committed to innovating"" in both VR and augmented reality systems. It said it would continue to maintain the software for Gear VR."
technology	Facebook device plugs into your TV	'A conversation we didn't foresee'Unknown performance'Eyeballs'	"Facebook has updated its ""Portal"" range of video chat devices, including a new version that plugs directly into a TV.Portal TV, available in the US from November, sits on top of - or at the bottom of - the screen and, like other Portal devices, features tracking technology to follow people around the room.But the company also revealed it had resumed the use of human contractors to review and transcribe audio clips gathered through its Portal devices.Data collection and storage was suspended last month following controversy over the practice, which some argued was not properly disclosed to users.But as of Wednesday, clips gathered through the use of Portal's voice assistant would again be heard and analysed by humans, unless users choose to opt out. Human review of audio captured by Facebook's Messenger mobile app was still ""paused"", the firm said.""The new settings begin to roll out tomorrow on existing Portal devices,"" a spokeswoman said.""Everyone will get a notification that explains how your 'Hey Portal' voice interactions are used and directs you to settings if you want to turn off storage.""The audio does not include the content of calls made on the device, Facebook added.Facebook, as well as Apple, Google and Amazon, was found to have been using hundreds of human contractors to listen to and transcribe audio. All four companies said it was necessary to improve the quality of voice-controlled devices.In an interview with the BBC, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's head of hardware, acknowledged that the firm has misjudged public perception of the use of human contractors.""We're learning a lot about how comfortable people feel with data use,"" he said.""This was a conversation that we obviously didn't foresee, or we would have been more proactive about it. But upon being exposed to it, we're happy to take the action we've taken to give people that control that they wanted over how the content is used, and how it's reviewed.""Facebook first launched its Portal range in November 2018. While technology reviewers generally approved of the products' design and usability, most acknowledged that the firm's reputational difficulties would perhaps turn consumers off.Facebook has yet to share how many Portal devices it has sold. Facebook's financial disclosures do not provide specific figures on Portal, but its most recent filings show that earnings from ""payments and other fees"" - which includes Portal, Facebook's virtual reality products and all other non-advertising related income - was up 36% on the same period last year.However, despite the jump, ""payments and other fees"" accounted for less than 2% of Facebook's $17bn revenue in the last quarter.For 2019, Facebook is revamping the range, with a new device, an 8-inch Portal Mini, styled to look like a picture frame and a redesigned version of the original 10-inch Portal.Most significant is the introduction of the Portal TV, which plugs into the HDMI slot of a typical modern TV set, but is placed either on top of - or at the bottom of - the TV screen. Using a remote control or voice commands, users can navigate to watch content on Facebook Watch - the firm's on-demand service - or Amazon Prime Video.Facebook would not comment on whether any other deals with other streaming firms, such as Netflix, were on the way.At $149 (£120), the TV device is priced ""aggressively"", according to analysts.""It's a way to get eyeballs,"" commented Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies.""Once Facebook is in your home, it's going to be much easier to build something from that and experiment with what they have. If they're not even in your home they don't have a chance.""Portal TV competes with rival devices from Google, Amazon and Apple, all of which offer a much wider array of entertainment.But Mr Bosworth said Portal TV's video call function will set it apart. Calls can be made to other Portal users, or anyone using Facebook's Messenger or Whatsapp apps.""We are offering something that none of those other services can offer, which is the ability to connect emotionally with other people."""
technology	Facebook encryption: Should governments be given keys to access our messages?	What is end-to-end encryption?Why has this become an issue now?Is there evidence encryption has hampered police enquiries?Would it be easy for Facebook to give police a backdoor?	"Governments in the UK, US and Australia have asked Facebook, in an open letter, to roll back plans to bring end-to-end encryption to all of its platforms.Facebook, rocked by privacy scandals, responds that everyone has the right to a private conversation.It is the latest in an age-old battle between privacy and safety, which has played out between governments and tech firms ever since digital communication became mass market.As the name suggests, this is a secure way of sending information so that only the intended receiver can read it.The information is encrypted while it is still on the sender's device and is only decrypted when it reaches the person intended. Nobody, not even the platform owner, has the keys to unlock it.It was introduced partly as a response to National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations that the intelligence services in the UK and US had many ways to intercept communication and were doing so on a mass scale.The UK and the US have just signed an historic agreement to give each other a much faster way of getting hold of private conversations - cutting down the process time from months or years, to weeks or days.But that agreement could potentially be rendered a bit useless, if they cannot read the scrambled messages.When the BBC asked the Home Office to provide examples, it could not do so.The real issue is the fact that Facebook will no longer be able to police its own content, it said.It pointed to the fact that last year Facebook sent 12 million reports of child exploitation or abuse to the US's National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and it would no longer be able to do this if it had encryption on all its platforms.It is something that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg addressed directly in a Q&A with staff about the issue.""When we decided to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this is one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said.""There is more stuff on basically being able to identify patterns of activity, especially around sharing child pornography, and things like this that are just terrible, that I think you can probably find through patterns of activity and that we are going to ramp up investment of,"" he added.He was keen to point out that the fact there was so much child abuse imagery reported via Facebook did not indicate that Messenger, the name of Facebook's direct messaging service, was the preferred platform for it, more that Facebook had become very good at finding it and sending it on.""A backdoor is rather like leaving a key under the mat - once someone knows it is there anyone can walk in,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey and a consultant to Europol.His words were echoed by human rights pressure group Amnesty International in its response.""Proposals for a 'backdoor' have repeatedly been shown to be unworkable. There is no middle ground: if law enforcement is allowed to circumvent encryption, then anybody can,"" it said.Governments could also ask the social network to change the technical architecture of its platforms so messages could be decrypted when they reached the server. But that would signal a return to days of mass surveillance, thinks Prof Woodward.""It's exactly what we had before Snowden's revelations and the reaction of the service providers was to introduce end-to-end encryption such that they could not disclose either the key or the decrypted message even if compelled to by law. The laws of mathematics currently trump the law of the land.""And, of course, there is good old-fashioned policing - if the police request data from WhatsApp, they do get IP addresses, phone numbers and contact lists which could be useful in piecing together evidence, even without the full messages"
technology	On the Record: Andrew 'Boz' Bosworth, Facebook's hardware boss	Interview transcript (edited for clarity)	"Recently Facebook found itself in yet another privacy storm - this time over its undisclosed use of human contractors to listen to and review audio clips captured through Facebook Messenger and - as we learned this week - the firm's Portal video chat devices.Facebook ""paused"" the practice.But now the team behind Portal - led by Andrew Bosworth - has launched a new range, including one that attaches to your TV. As part of that announcement, we learned that human contractors would be unpaused, and would be used once again to transcribe and analyse a small number of audio clips captured by the device.I’m going to make an admission here: I think the Portal is an absolutely excellent product with some genuinely innovative features. But with Facebook’s reputation in the dirt, does it matter?I put that to Bosworth - known as ""Boz"" - during a brief sit-down I had with him earlier this week.I also asked him about plans for Facebook’s so-called Supreme Court of content moderation, and why he thinks virtual reality hasn’t hit the big time, despite billions of dollars of investment from Facebook.To start, though, I thought I'd give ""Boz"" a chance discuss his new devices.End of Soundcloud post by daveleebbcDave Lee, BBC: Talk me through the new hardware.Andrew Bosworth, Facebook: So we've got a 10-inch display, and now an eight-inch display, we call the Portal Mini, which is an HD display. They're both designed just to look like picture frames. And so they fit into any house really easily. They don't look like consumer electronics devices at all, they really just look like something that you bring home. But they're still able to deliver that same great video-calling experience that people came to love. And we've also found that people really love having big immersive video calling experiences. Even our Portal+ the 15.6-inch display, people want an even bigger experience. So we're launching Portal TV, which uses the biggest screen in your home, the TV, and turns it into a great video calling experience.Of course, every time Facebook brings out hardware, you face that debate of why would I have a Facebook product in my house, particularly one with a camera? One that can, by design, follow you around the room? How do you respond to people who are saying, I just don't want your company in my front room.You know, video calling is the essence of what Facebook is about. It's connecting people face-to-face and giving them that rich experience. And for us, being able to do that... the phone has some limitations. It's pretty great for a lot of things. But having a really big immersive video calling experience isn't one of them. And so we saw the opportunity to move beyond the phone and give people that experience, which is exactly what I think Facebook kind of has come to deliver for people with that experience of connecting with people they care about.But you need to move beyond the company's reputation as well, right? So how do you get that to consumers?At every point in our product development, we have to think about what is going to give users the comfort, the confidence that they can use this product. And, you know, for Facebook as a company, and for each product that we build, we've got to earn people's trust, and that never stops. That's every single decision we make. That's every single product release. So for Portal, it's about robust privacy controls, being able to control when the camera and microphone are on and active. And then when those things are on and active, giving people that great experience they want of connecting to a loved one.How much of a hindrance are the problems around Facebook, when it comes to reputation, to the success of your division, your unit? You're in charge of hardware, you don't have to work about election security and all that kind of stuff. It's holding you back, isn't it? It's holding your division back.We launched Portal a year ago in October. And we've been really delighted with the response. And not only in terms of people buying the product, but also how much people are using and engaging with the product. I mean, so much so that obviously we're coming up with another generation now. So I think to some degree, we underestimate how much people really want to connect with loved ones in these rich, immersive ways. And when the tool comes up, that's the right tool for that job, they're going to take that opportunity.So you think Facebook's reputation over data, over privacy, doesn't affect sales? I find it hard to believe that it wouldn't.We certainly found a reception that's been really warm for the product. You know, it's hard for me to say what the reception could have been in a different universe. But for us, yeah, we take that seriously, we try to focus on making sure this product addresses all the concerns someone might have from a data privacy perspective, while not sacrificing on the value it creates.So within this product, the key features: video calling, and you'll be able to watch things like Facebook Watch. When it comes to serving entertainment through it, you've got a tonne of big competitors out there that are already in people's homes. And they're offering services that Portal, at least at the beginning, won't offer. So how can you convince people to use Portal instead?I think people have today a lot of great services that they're using, whether it be [voice] assistants or Netflix, and they've got access to those pieces. Right now what's actually the hard thing to do is to do great video calling, you know, you can do it on your phone, but it's kind of awkward, and it's hard to fit more than one person into the call. And so we're offering something that none of these other services can offer, which is the ability to connect immersively with other people. And even with Facebook Watch the focus there is our ability to watch together, watch with somebody else. And so, you know, I think it's great that we're able to provide some of those pieces that people really want for their home. Amazon Prime Video, for example. In general, our focus is definitely on providing that experience that really only Facebook can provide.So does that mean the watching element of original content is secondary as a priority? Because you've got companies like Apple saying it will spend $5bn a year on content. You don't hear Facebook saying that kind of thing.We feel pretty good about the content we have with Amazon Prime Video and Facebook Watch, which represents a good catalogue. But you're right, there's a huge amount of content out there. And you can go on and on and on with lots of different players in the space. I think people who want to get access to that content have ways to do that. What I think is actually the more rare thing is the ability to connect with somebody immersively.We've never had a sense really of how successful the first round of Portal projects was. Are you going to be open about this now? Are you going to tell us how many Portals have been sold, people really want to know...We're not sharing specific or even vague numbers about it. But I will say the proof is kind of in the pudding, isn't it? We're coming here with our second generation of devices now, which I think is a very strong indicator that we feel really positive about the reception we got to the first generation.And the price point, particularly for the TV device seems pretty low given it's a camera and various other things. Facebook, I assume, is making a loss on this...?For us, the most important thing is giving people access to the tools. You know, Facebook itself is a free service. And so for us, reducing the price was a really important thing to increase the access people had to what we think is a great experience that's going to connect them to ones they love. So for Portal at $179, Portal TV at $149 and Portal Mini at $129. We believe we've built the most price competitive products in the marketplace.And the margin is... favourable to Facebook? Or you're making a loss on each of those devices?We're not as focused on the business model of the margin. We don't share specific numbers. We are very focused on getting this tool into people's homes and hands so that they can use and experience it and so that we can learn what works and doesn't work for them. This whole category is new, we're pretty confident that as it grows, we'll find opportunities monetise. But that's not our focus right now.With the original Portals, there was a lot of back-and-forth when it came to what data was being captured, what was going to be used for ads, what wasn't. You guys had a couple of conflicting statements. So what's the state of play now? When I use one of these new Portals, and I'm doing a video call, what data is Facebook gathering, and to what end is it used for advertising?Just like the first generation of Portal, you can think of this as Messenger running on your phone. And so it uses the same common infrastructure that Messenger uses. And as a consequence, some of that data may be used to inform advertising, for example, that this is a person who does video calls. However that's not really the point of it at the volumes that we're seeing - not just with Portal, but the entire category - it's not really material to an advertising business. So that's just kind of an incidental fact that we're using Messenger and using other Facebook services.And one of the aspects of this when it comes the voice is human review, contractors that are going to be listening to even a small number of voice recordings gathered through this. Explain clearly what the policy is there.Yeah, we've had a really important conversation about how voice data is used. So for us....Facebook was highly criticised for not being clear on this. It's more than a conversation. It's a fight back from your consumers......when we launched Portal a year ago, people had control over the voice interactions, they could see what voice interactions were stored, and they could delete those. We've now added the ability to disable storage entirely. So if people aren't comfortable, they can disable storage, and then the recordings or the transcripts aren't stored or viewed. And they can do that either on the device itself, or in Facebook activity log at any time.How are you going to make that option clear to people? How prominent is the button that says you can clear all your history?When you're going through the out-of-the-box experience, when you first get the device and you set it up, one of the options will be to turn off the storage setting. And it's also something that people will be able to see at any time in the settings and also on their Facebook app,Does the wording recommend that people don't turn off storage?We really believe that the default experience of improving voice services overall is the right one. You know, we want to provide the best experience just like anybody else in this space. And people love having assistants, and they're very, very popular. And making those assistants work inclusively for everybody who might have a different accent or have different word choices is actually a good thing. And we believe it gives people the best experience over time, at a very low risk from a privacy or safety standpoint. But again, it is important to give people control over the data, which is why we've added the ability for those who aren't comfortable with that to opt out of storage entirely.When those stories surfaced about people being upset about human review, did that surprise you? Because I get the sense that people in the industry, they feel like well, this is just part and parcel of how these services work. But for most normal people who don't know how these systems work, they seemed very upset about that. Do you regret how that has been communicated up until now?We're learning a lot about how people will feel comfortable about data use. And I think people are learning a lot about themselves and how they feel about their data use, and that's been evolving over time. So for us, this was a conversation that we obviously didn't foresee, or we would have been more proactive about it. But upon being exposed to it, you know, we're happy to take the action we've taken to give people that control that they wanted, over how the content is used and how it's reviewed.Another thing Facebook is embarking on is the idea of this moderation ""Supreme Court"", and having an independent board that can look at what Facebook does, and make decisions on his behalf. Is that going to affect hardware as well as posts on Facebook? Do you come under their purview?You know, that's such an important and emerging area of work. I'm not the expert on it and I don't want to talk out of turn. But I will say we benefit in the hardware division a great deal from all the work that Facebook is doing around content moderation around privacy, because we get to take advantage of all that work for what are really new platforms. So whether it be virtual reality, or augmented reality, we get to benefit from all the robust systems that Facebook is building up right now.When it comes to concerns about competition, it seems Facebook is determined to power ahead, bringing out new products and expanding into new areas. Are you concerned that the pace at which you're releasing products could hinder your ability to convince regulators that you're not too powerful?You know, we follow a pretty clear mission - to connect people - that we really believe in. And when we see opportunities to do that, you know, we like to try to put those products in the marketplace. Ultimately, it is the marketplace that decides whether what we're building has value or not, and how much to engage with it or not. And so for us, being able to put products into the marketplace and learn is part of how we create value for the world.So you don't hold back? You don't think ""we could do this, but we won't, because we're worried that the people that are going to clamp down on Facebook's power might not be too happy about that""?We always are making sure that we're doing everything from a privacy, safety and security standpoint that we can and those are our top priorities across the entire company, more so now than ever before. And so those are our top priorities - very focused on consumers and what they expect and what they're going to be comfortable with. And that's where we really focus our concerns and our energy. Beyond that it's what value can we create. You know, I really have confidence that over time with these systems that we're developing, we're going to win the trust of consumers and continue to be able to connect people, which is what we came here to do in the first place.One of the talking points around competition is the idea that Facebook might be broken up into smaller pieces. It seems like hardware might be an easy way to do that - the hardware part of Facebook becomes a separate company. Is that something that you're thinking about? What might be the implications?You know, it's not something I really spend my time thinking about. I mean...Not even a little? It's looming, right? The company must be considering the implications of these anti-trust investigations?If you think about the work we're doing in AR and VR, we're talking about augmented reality, we're talking about virtual reality. Technologies that, in the case of augmented reality, are maybe several years away from being fulfilled in the vision we imagine. Virtual reality, which is now just coming to the place that we had hoped it would get to. Devices for the home, for which we're exploring entirely new use cases. That is what occupies my time and energy. And it's enough.Your big Oculus developer event is next week. Every single time I go to that event, I'm told, ""This is it. VR is here, we're ready, this is going to be a year where sales go through the roof"" - though you won't tell us how many Oculus devices you sell either. Where are we with VR? And how much runway do you have from Mark Zuckerberg to get this right? Because it hasn't taken hold yet. You've made progress, but it hasn't taken hold yet.Oculus Quest, I think is the form factor that we've been waiting for, for a long time, a standalone device that can deliver the full six degrees of freedom and hands that people expect when they're in virtual reality. And that is, I feel like the culmination of all the work that the industry is kind of driving towards for the last several years. Now, of course, it's going to take time for that form factor to build up the content and the audience. But we really think we've hit a turning point here with that form factor. And we have a lot of plans, obviously, to continue to improve it and double down. So we're feeling very strong about where we are positioned with virtual reality. It's taken a long time to get to that form factor that we thought really, every consumer could pretty easily enjoy. But I think we've gotten there now. And so the question is, yeah, how quickly does it get adopted? And this is a pretty novel technology, you know, this is a little harder than just a phone. This is something that you've got to put on your face and really experience to understand it.Was it harder than you thought? I remember seeing Oculus years ago before it was a Facebook product, and thinking, wow, this is really close. We could do this. Almost 10 years on, it doesn't feel like it's had the impact that many thought it would. What did you think was going to happen?You know, there's an old saying in technology that you know, a lot more gets done in 10 years than you think will and a lot less gets done in one year. And I think that's been true for virtual reality. If you look at where we really were 10 years ago, it's amazing the progress we've made. It's staggering. A product like Oculus Quest was unthinkable at that point from not just a hardware perspective, but from a software perspective. The machine vision required to deliver on that experience just didn't exist. Even three years ago, people thought it was maybe impossible. And now we're shipping it. And so I do think we've made tremendous progress in the last decade. But every year you realise that, maybe the summit is a little further than you'd previously thought._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Facebook suspends tens of thousands of apps	Why is Facebook suspending apps?What do we know about the apps?	"Facebook says it has suspended tens of thousands of apps as part of an investigation it launched in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal.The suspended apps were associated with about 400 developers, it said.Facebook said not all the apps posed a threat to users.The company came under huge pressure in 2018 after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had accessed many users' data without permission.The political consultancy firm is alleged to have used this data - harvested by a personality quiz - to target political advertising.Facebook was fined $5bn in July by the US Federal Trade Commission, in what was believed to have been the biggest ever fine imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy.The Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the data of tens of millions of people, was hugely damaging for Facebook and the company has since faced lawsuits and international criticism.It is now seeking to improve its privacy safeguards and its image.As part of that, in March last year Facebook launched an investigation into apps on its platform, involving hundreds of lawyers, data scientists and engineers.""Our review helps us to better understand patterns of abuse in order to root out bad actors among developers,"" the company's vice-president for product partnerships, Ime Archibong, said in a statement on Friday.Facebook has released little specific information on the tens of thousands of apps or hundreds of developers in question.The statement said that the suspension of the apps was not necessarily an indication that they posed a threat to people.""Many were not live but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them,"" Mr Archibong said.In some cases developers were subjected to in-depth questioning after being flagged.Some apps were banned completely for reasons including inappropriately sharing data obtained from Facebook or making data publicly available without protecting people's identity.One banned app called myPersonality was found to be sharing information with researchers and companies with only limited protections in place, and then refused to take part in an audit, according to Facebook.The app review is ongoing."
technology	Facebook unveils its plan for oversight board	How would the process work?Why is Facebook doing this?	"Facebook has unveiled its plan to create an independent ""oversight"" board to make decisions over how the network is moderated.The firm insisted the panel, which will hear its first ""cases"" in 2020, will have power to override decisions it makes over contentious material and influence new policy.The idea, dubbed the Facebook supreme court, will eventually comprise 40 people around the world, but will be smaller at first.Experts have questioned the board's independence, as well as the motivation behind the move.""Facebook does not have a court,"" said Bernie Hogan, senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""The only vote that really counts is the majority shareholder, Mark Zuckerberg.""He added: ""Facebook's 'supreme court' invokes all the pomp and circumstance of actual judicial practice without any of the responsibility to citizens.""The board will launch with no fewer than 11 part-time members, Facebook said, and the names of those appointed will be made public - as will the results of their deliberations. The board will be paid via a trust set up and funded by Facebook upfront.""We are responsible for enforcing our policies every day and we make millions of content decisions every week,"" wrote Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. ""But ultimately I don't believe private companies like ours should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own.""Facebook outlined how the board would operate in a charter published on Tuesday. The goals of the panel, as stated by Facebook, are to:Major disagreements will be escalated to the panel once all of Facebook's existing moderation layers had been exhausted. Facebook controls which cases are submitted to the board, although panel members will decide which of those cases to take on.Facebook anticipated that the board would only consider ""dozens"" of cases a year, focusing on those where a clear decision would be in ""the greatest public benefit"".Users affected will be allowed to state their case in a written statement, but Facebook said it anticipated some board members may wish to speak to users ""face-to-face"".""The board's decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""The board will use our values to inform its decisions and explain its reasoning openly and in a way that protects people's privacy.""One caveat, according to the firm's charter, is when recommendations are not technically feasible.Facebook said the trust would be opened up for other networks to join - and fund - in future.Facebook's primary concern is that it doesn't want the power it currently wields - or at least, it doesn't want the scrutiny that power attracts. Its ability to decide what goes on its platform, the biggest network of people ever created, brings it nothing but trouble, particularly in its home country.One recent example demonstrates the conflict Facebook faces. An anti-abortion video, deemed to contain inaccuracies by an independent fact-checking group contracted by Facebook, was removed - only to be reinstated after four Republican senators complained to Mr Zuckerberg personally, accusing the site of having a bias against conservative views.In future, this kind of decision could be taken out of Facebook's direct control and handed to the oversight board, which has the power to override the site's policies - although experts predict Facebook will still bear the brunt of criticism.""This panel is seen as an attempt to do something, but it appears to be just short of having enough teeth to make a difference,"" argued Mr Hogan. ""It is a way to tell critics 'lay off, we are doing all it can'. Such a panel, while admirable is no match for some well organised trolls or broad systemic issues."""
technology	Facebook hints at hiding 'likes'		"An engineer has discovered prototype code in Facebook's Android app which suggests it might test hiding the number of likes a post receives.Jane Manchun Wong found the code, which has not been activated.Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, is conducting a similar test in seven countries including Canada and Brazil, where only the account holder in the trial can see the number of likes they attract.Facebook declined to comment.Some studies have suggested the pressures of social media popularity can affect mental health, particularly in young people.Ms Wong wrote a blog post about her discovery, in which she emphasised that she does not work for the tech giant.""It takes time to develop, observe, research and release experimental features like this,"" she said.""Experimental features could come and go. But I am certain hiding the public like counts will be beneficial to the digital wellbeing of a large chunk of users.""Venture capitalist Ellen Pao tweeted that the change - if it happens - is overdue.""Social platforms have known as early as 2014 that social media impacts mental health and only now is Facebook starting to hide like counts,"" she said.Instagram said it was not yet ready to share the results of its experiment.""We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love,"" Mia Garlick, Facebook Australia and New Zealand director of policy, said in a statement when the Instagram trial was announced."
technology	Facebook faces fresh anti-trust investigation		"Facebook is under investigation in the US to determine whether it has ""stifled competition and put users at risk"".The new action was announced by New York state Attorney General Letitia James on behalf of a coalition of representatives from several states.""Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,"" said Ms James.Facebook said people had ""multiple choices"" when it came to using online services.""We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the United States but around the globe,"" said Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy.State officials from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee are part of the investigation, as well as the district of Columbia.""We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising,"" said Ms James.Facebook already faces a separate anti-trust investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission.And in July, the US Justice Department opened a broad investigation of major technology firms, focusing on potentially anti-competitive practices.Facebook has previously claimed it is not a monopoly and said consumers can choose how to connect with friends online."
technology	Sex lives of app users 'shared with Facebook'		"Intimate data, including when people have had sex, is being shared with Facebook, a study from Privacy International has suggested.PI studied a range of period-tracking apps to see exactly what information was shared with the social network.It included details such as what contraception was used, when periods were due and the type of symptoms experienced.Since the investigation, one app said it was changing its privacy policies.Menstruation apps collect some of the most intimate data imaginable - from general health, to information about sex, moods, what the user eats, drinks and even what sanitary products she uses.In exchange for this, the app will offer the user the dates of the month she is most fertile or when to expect her next period.Sharing to Facebook happens via the social network's software development kit (SDK), tools that can be used by apps to help them make money by reaching advertisers who, in turn, provide users with personalised ads.PI found the most popular apps in this category - Period Tracker, Period Track Flo and Clue Period Tracker did not share data with Facebook.But others - such as Maya by Plackal Tech (which has 5 million downloads on Google Play), MIA by Mobapp Development Limited (1 million downloads) and My Period Tracker by Linchpin Health (more than 1 million downloads) - did.PI said: ""The wide reach of the apps that our research has looked at might mean that intimate details of the private lives of millions of users across the world are shared with Facebook and other third parties without those users' free unambiguous and informed or explicit consent, in the case of sensitive personal data, such as data relating to a user's health or sex life.""On being shown the study, Maya told PI that it had ""removed both the Facebook core SDK and Analytics SDK from Maya"" with the changes coming into effect almost immediately.It said it would continue to use Facebook Ad SDK for those who had agreed to its terms and conditions and privacy policy, but added that no ""personally identifiable data or medical data"" is shared.In a statement to the BBC it added: ""All data accessed by Maya are essential to the proper functioning of the product. Predicting information pertaining to menstrual cycles is complex and dependent on thousands of variables.""Our users are made aware of our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy prior to signing up on Maya.

technology	Facebook confirms millions of phone numbers exposed		"Facebook has confirmed about 200 million phone numbers from members have been exposed in an online database.The company said it was investigating who had compiled the database and left it online unprotected.It includes telephone numbers for about 18 million Facebook members in the UK.The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had referred the matter to its Irish equivalent - the IDPC - which is the supervisory authority for Facebook in the EU.The database of telephone numbers and Facebook IDs was discovered on an unprotected web server and was not password protected.It is not believed to have been compiled or put there by Facebook.The database was taken offline after the news site TechCrunch reported the issue to the web hosting company.In April 2018, Facebook switched off a feature that let people search for other users by typing in their phone number.The company said ""malicious actors"" had abused the feature by typing in millions of phone numbers to find out who owned them.It said they had been harvesting profiles and phone numbers for years by abusing the search tool and that anybody who had not changed their privacy settings after adding their phone number should assume their information had been harvested.And it is thought the database reported by TechCrunch may have been compiled by using this tool."
technology	Russia complains about Facebook and Google election ads		"Russia has complained to both Facebook and Google, claiming adverts they circulated ""interfered"" with elections in the country.The adverts were seen on social media and the web while local elections were under way in Russia this weekend.Facebook said Russia should talk to advertisers, who were responsible for complying with local laws.Google said it supported ""responsible"" political advertising that complied with Russian laws.Russia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said Google and Facebook had flouted its demand to ban political advertising while voting was under way across the country.""Such actions can be seen as interference in Russia's sovereign affairs and hindering the conduct of democratic elections in the Russian Federation,"" it said in a statement.Russian laws put strict limits on when political adverts can be run and demands they are not seen while elections are ongoing.In response, Facebook said it was up to advertisers to make sure their messages were sent out at appropriate times.In a statement given to Reuters, Google said any adverts had to ""comply with local legislative demands including the laws on elections and voting rights and mandatory 'election silence' for any geographical areas where such advertising is oriented"".The Roskomnadzor complaint comes soon after Russia rebuked Google for letting YouTube users share information about protests in the country.Regulators called on Google to remove the videos or face punishment."
technology	Election ads: Energy group attacks Labour nationalisation plans	Nationalisation plans'Happy to register'Seen any political ads? Send them to us	"An energy industry lobby group has been buying adverts on Facebook attacking Labour's nationalisation policies ahead of the general election.The Energy Networks Association has so far spent £3,215 on 130 ads on the social media site.The lobby group has registered with Facebook as a political advertiser and says it is in discussions with the Electoral Commission about whether it needs to register as a non-party campaigner.The trade group, whose members include National Grid and Scottish and Southern Energy, has bought adverts for a campaign called Securing A Green Future.The ads include messages such as ""What matters more to you and your family? NHS spending or nationalisation of the energy networks?""A Facebook user who had seen one of the adverts sent it to the BBC. The man said the ad ""seeks to cast a negative light on the Labour pledge to nationalise industries"".Some have warned these plans would cost too much. But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that the party's proposals would be cost-neutral as the companies' profits would cover the cost of borrowing needed to finance it.The user who sent in the ad told the BBC it ""seems like a targeted effort from energy suppliers who stand to lose assets + profits with nationalisation, but who's to say"".When he clicked on a ""why am I seeing this ad"" message, it appeared to be targeted at people aged 65 and over living in London.A spokesman for the Energy Networks Association said the Securing Our Green Future campaign was ""a new long-term project that aims to raise awareness of the vital role energy networks have to play in helping the UK reach its goals"".But he conceded that references to the nationalisation of energy networks were about Labour Party policies.Commenting on the ad, a Labour spokesperson told the BBC: ""Instead of investing profits into upgrading the grid to tackle the climate emergency and lowering people's energy bills, these private energy companies have been siphoning off money to shareholders and wasting bill payers' money on targeted ads.""These companies are afraid of real change with Labour and we welcome their opposition.""The Electoral Commission says non-party organisations such as the Energy Networks Association have to register with it if they plan to spend more than £20,000 in England or £10,000 in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland during the course of a campaign.A spokesperson said ""we advised them earlier this year that if an election is called and they think that their spending is likely to reach these values, it would be necessary to register"".The Energy Networks Association says it is very happy to register with the Electoral Commission. A spokesman said the net zero carbon target was an important issue and it was committed to having a debate in the most transparent way possible.A number of non-party groups have been buying Facebook ads, from anti-Labour groups such as the Campaign against Corbynism to the pro-remain Best for Britain.But the Energy Networks Association appears to be the first mainstream trade association to launch Facebook adverts during the election campaign.Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social media platform, send a screenshot of it and the Why Am I Seeing This Ad message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk."
technology	Facebook tightens rules amid 2020 US election fears		"Facebook has unveiled new political advertising rules ahead of next year's US presidential election amid fears the platform will be exploited.Political advertisers will now have to verify their identity before being given a ""confirmed organisation"" label.It marks the latest in a series of attempts to address incidents where users placed misleading or inaccurate ads to influence voters.The rules will also apply to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.Paid-for Facebook ads have become a popular tool for political campaigns and other organisations to target voters.The platform previously revealed that the 2016 Trump campaign had spent in the region of $70m (£57.3m) on ads over the election period.Facebook has been rolling out transparency tools on a country-by-country basis ever since reports claimed that Russia-based agents had uploaded content to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election.Facebook has required political advertisers in the US to put a ""paid for"" disclaimer on their ads since 2018, but the changes have not completely stamped out improper use.The company recently banned the Falun Gong-linked Epoch News outlet after a report from NBC News claimed it had used falsely labelled pages to push pro-Trump adverts.Previously journalists at Vice News managed to place ads on the site purporting to be on behalf of US Vice President Mike Pence.Sarah Schiff, product manager at Facebook, said the new rules were in direct response to such loopholes being exploited.""In 2018 we did see evidence of misuse in these disclaimers and so this is our effort to strengthen the process,"" she told the Newcastle Herald.Aaron Reike, managing director at digital justice organisation Upturn, told the BBC he was ""surprised"" it had taken the platform so long to implement such rules.Facebook's former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, has suggested it would be tough for the company to implement the new rules across all its platforms.""Instagram has some of the same problems Twitter has in that you can have a pseudo-anonymous identity,"" he told The Verge. ""So, 'Is Instagram ready?' is actually a big question."""
technology	Facebook puts $10m into effort to spot deep fake videos		"A $10m (£8.1m) fund has been set up to find better ways to detect so-called deep fake videos.Facebook, Microsoft and several UK and US universities are putting up the cash for the wide-ranging research project.Deep fake clips use AI software to make people - often politicians or celebrities - say or do things they never did or said.Many fear such videos will be used to sow distrust or manipulate opinion.The cash will help create detection systems as well as a ""data set"" of fakes that the tools can be tested against.""The goal of the challenge is to produce technology that everyone can use to better detect when AI has been used to alter a video in order to mislead the viewer,"" wrote Mike Schroepfer, chief technical officer at Facebook, in a blog outlining the project.One of the key elements will be to create the data set used to calibrate and rate the different fake-spotting systems.Mr Schroepfer said data sets for other AI-based systems including those that can identify images or spoken language, had fuelled a ""renaissance"" in those technologies and prompted wide innovation.The data set will be generated using paid actors to perform scenes which can then be used to create deep fake videos that the different detection systems will attempt to spot.No Facebook data will be used to generate this freely available bank of images, audio clips and videos, said Mr Schroepfer.He added that the database of deep fakes will be made available in December.The cash will also be used to fund work at many universities, including Cornell, Oxford and UC Berkeley,The technology to create convincing fakes has spread widely since it first appeared in early 2018. Now it has become much easier and quicker to create the videos, with many worrying the convincing clips will feature in propaganda campaigns.One commentator said the tools to spot the fakes may not solve all the problems the technology presents.""It's a cat-and-mouse game,"" Siddharth Garg, an assistant professor of computer engineering at New York University told Reuters.""If I design a detection for deep fakes, I'm giving the attacker a new discriminator to test against."""
technology	Facebook workers listened to Messenger conversations		"Hundreds of workers were paid to transcribe voice recordings of Facebook users, it has emerged.Facebook is the latest company to confirm it has used third-party workers to do such work, following Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.The practice had been halted ""more than a week ago"", Facebook said.Workers were given audio of people's conversations but were not told how it was obtained, according to Bloomberg, which was first to report the news.Facebook said the recordings were being transcribed manually so that artificial intelligence systems used to automatically transcribe conversations could be improved.It added this had been done only when users had opted in to transcription services and given permission for microphone access.""Much like Apple and Google, we paused human review of audio more than a week ago,"" a spokeswoman said.Facebook's lead supervisory authority on data protection within the EU is Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner.""We are now seeking detailed information from Facebook on the processing in question and how Facebook believes that such processing of data is compliant with their GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] obligations,"" a spokeswoman told BBC News.Earlier this month, Apple and Google said they had paused the practice of getting workers to listen to voice recordings of users so they could be transcribed.Microsoft also confirmed voice recordings of users of Skype's automatic translation service were also analysed by humans.The data regulator in Luxembourg is also currently in discussions with Amazon about its similar use of workers to check some Alexa voice recordings."

technology	Facebook faces legal fight over facial recognition	Unique harm	"A US court has thrown out an attempt by Facebook to stop legal action over the way it collected images of people's faces.The case centres around images people uploaded to Facebook that were later used to help identify them in other pictures.This led Facebook users in Illinois to allege that the service had not got permission to use images in this way.The decision means their class action lawsuit can now go ahead.The social network had sought to defuse the legal claims by trying to convince the court that each user's claim was unique and required its own lawsuit.The San Francisco court unanimously rejected this and said those suing Facebook had suffered ""sufficient privacy injuries"" to allow them to sue as a group.The lawsuit alleges that Facebook did not do enough to warn people it would be collecting detailed images of their faces and that it did not get their explicit consent to do so.""This biometric data is so sensitive that if it is compromised, there is simply no recourse,"" said lawyer Shawn Williams who is acting for the group. ""It's not like a Social Security card or credit card number where you can change the number. You can't change your face.""The class action has also won support from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which has taken a strong stance against the growing use of facial recognition data.The ACLU said such recognition systems had the potential to do ""unique privacy harms"".""This decision is a strong recognition of the dangers of unfettered use of face surveillance technology,"" ACLU staff attorney Nathan Wessler said in a statement.The legal action began in 2015 with a claim Facebook had broken Illinois laws limiting the collection of biometric data.If the class action court case succeeds, Facebook could end up paying substantial damages. The Illinois law levies fees of $1,000 (£826) for each ""negligent violation"" of its biometrics laws and $5,000 for each ""reckless"" violation.Millions of users could be included in the class action, said Reuters, potentially leading to a massive payout.Facebook said it planned to appeal against the decision.It added: ""We have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time.""Facial recognition technology is coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators and governments. In the UK, MPs have said it should stop being used and the Information Commissioner said it raised ""significant"" privacy issues."
technology	Facebook: Did social network mislead MPs?	'Data misuse'	"British MPs are taking Facebook to task over evidence appearing to contradict testimony the US tech company gave about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Facebook bosses told MPs they had learned users' data had been misused via a December 2015 Guardian report.But a US watchdog has now said Facebook workers flagged the problem three months earlier.MPs want answers by mid-August. The social network has said it will respond ""in due course"".Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Facebook $100m (£82.6m) for misleading disclosures about the handling of user data.According to the regulator's document, Facebook's advertising team had described Cambridge Analytica as a ""sketchy (to say the least) data modelling company that has penetrated our market deeply"".It said the employees had asked their bosses in September 2015 to investigate ""possible scraping... of Facebook user data"" by the consultancy.Now, MPs want the company to explain why senior Facebook executives insisted to MPs they had not heard about Cambridge Analytica's suspected misuse of data until December 2015.That was when a Guardian newspaper article revealed the company had been working for US senator Ted Cruz, using data harvested from millions of Facebook accounts.The MPs also want to know why no action was taken until 2018.Damian Collins, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee, has written to Facebook demanding an explanation as to how the ""discrepancies in evidence occurred"".""We request a response on whether the SEC complaint is accurate that employees did raise concerns about Cambridge Analytica before December 2015,"" his letter says.""We also ask for clarity regarding the timeline of Facebook employees' awareness of both Cambridge Analytica and GSR [Global Science Research]'s activity and data misuse,"" reads the letter to Facebook's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg.Mr Collins hashtagged The Great Hack in a tweet about his intervention.This refers to a documentary released by Netflix last week. It raises questions about Cambridge Analytica's role in President Trump's election, its ties to former White House strategist Steve Bannon, and what advice the business gave to pro-Brexit group Leave.EU.The committee also wants to know why ""red flags"" raised by Facebook employees were not dealt with by senior management.Mr Collins has repeatedly called on Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to travel to the UK in person to explain his role the scandal.And the DCMS committee has called on the UK government to overhaul the way political campaigning is conducted online.Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of millions of Facebook users via an online personality quiz designed by a Cambridge University academic, Aleksander Kogan, including information about the ""Facebook friends"" of those who had taken part.Facebook has agreed to pay a record $5bn to the US Federal Trade Commission to settle privacy concerns."
technology	Hong Kong protests: Twitter and Facebook remove Chinese accounts	What are the protests about?	"Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to block what they described as a state-backed Chinese misinformation campaign.Twitter said it removed 936 accounts it said were being used to “sow political discord in Hong Kong”.The network said the accounts originated in mainland China and were part of a coordinated attempt to undermine the “legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement”.Facebook said it had, after being tipped off by Twitter, removed ""seven Pages, three Groups and five Facebook accounts.”""They frequently posted about local political news and issues including topics like the ongoing protests in Hong Kong,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber-security policy.""Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.""In addition to the 936 specific accounts, Twitter said as many as 200,000 other accounts, designed to amplify the misinformation, were “proactively” suspended before becoming ""substantially active”.""Based on our intensive investigations,” the firm said in a statement, “we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation.""Specifically, we identified large clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify messages related to the Hong Kong protests.”It added: ""We will continue to be vigilant, learning from this network and proactively enforcing our policies to serve the public conversation.”The move came after Twitter was intensely criticised at the weekend for allowing China’s Xinhua news agency to buy sponsored posts on the network. Twitter said on Monday it would no longer allow such ads.""Going forward, we will not accept advertising from state-controlled news media entities,” the company said. ""Any affected accounts will be free to continue to use Twitter to engage in public conversation, just not our advertising products.”Twitter said the new policy did not, however, apply to ""to taxpayer-funded entities, including independent public broadcasters”.Researchers have begun investigating the flagged Twitter accounts.They have noted that some were created as far back as 2007 and had switched activities over the period, while others were less than a year old.""A number of these accounts move through numerous tools and many languages, switching after long breaks,"" wrote Renee DiResta, a Mozilla fellow in media, misinformation, and trust.""[It] suggests at least some of the old/high-follower ones were purchased, or potentially rented.""But to contrast with the 'Russia playbook', these weren't carefully-aged, well-developed persona accounts that worked narratives or built relationships with influencers.""For its part, Facebook has said that about 15,500 accounts had followed one or more of the pages suspected of being ""inauthentic"" on its platform, and about 2,200 accounts had joined at least one of the flagged Groups.Some have now called on Google to take action of its own to restrict state-backed propaganda uploaded to YouTube.The company told the Reuters news agency in June that state-owned media companies had the same rights as other users to run ads on its platform.The BBC has asked the firm to comment.Many thousands of Hong Kongers have been protesting since March against a proposed government bill that would have allowed extradition from the territory to the Chinese mainland.Critics of the bill argued that it would undermine the Hong Kong's judicial independence and could be used to target those who speak out against the Chinese government.The bill was suspended in June after a series of large demonstrations. But protests continued and have now morphed into a broader movement demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality during demonstrations.Last week, thousands of protesters flooded Hong Kong Airport's terminal buildings, leading to clashes with police and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.Organisers say 1.7 million people turned out at the latest mass-rally on Sunday. But police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned protest.The Chinese government has hardened its rhetoric following the airport unrest, condemning it as ""behaviour that is close to terrorism"".Understanding the Hong Kong protestsAdditional reporting by Leo Kelion"

technology	Facebook letter fails to satisfy DCMS chair Damian Collins	Scrape data	"Facebook's denials that it had given ""inconsistent evidence"" about the Cambridge Analytica affair have failed to convince a senior MP.The US company had been accused of contradicting itself in testimony to US and British officials.It defended itself by drawing a distinction between two incidents that had raised internal red flags about the political consultancy.But Damian Collins said the explanation was ""typically disingenuous"".Mr Collins chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, which investigated the social network as part of an inquiry into disinformation and ""fake news"".He subsequently wrote to Facebook's communications chief, Sir Nick Clegg, at the start of this month, to seek ""clarity"" about why documents published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to be in conflict with evidence previously given to Westminster.In particular, Mr Collins drew attention to the SEC's statement that Facebook employees had first requested an investigation into Cambridge Analytica in September 2015.He noted that Facebook's chief technical officer had told MPs that Facebook had first learned about the London company's misuse of data from a Guardian newspaper report in December 2015.The US company responded by saying its representatives had been ""entirely consistent"" in their accounts - since the two dates referred to ""two different things"".The earlier date, it said, had referred to the point in time its staff had heard of rumours that Cambridge Analytica had been promoting its ability to scrape data from public Facebook pages.The second date, it said, was when it had first heard of allegations that Cambridge Analytica had illicitly obtained private user data from a university researcher - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - who had gathered the information via a personality app.It also addressed concerns raised by Mr Collins about how long it had taken to bring the matter to the attention of Facebook's chief executive.The US technology company had previously said Mark Zuckerberg had not been notified until March 2018 about claims Cambridge Analytica had kept hold of Dr Kogan's data despite having being told to delete it.In its latest response, Facebook's UK public policy chief said this had been because its staff had been assured the records had been wiped.""Cambridge Analytica further certified that it had never used the data for commercial purposes,"" wrote Rebecca Stimson.""Facebook employees therefore believed as early as January 2016 that the situation had been resolved.""Mr Collins, however, has tweeted that he is still dissatisfied with this account.""They didn't previously disclose to us concerns about Cambridge Analytica prior to December 2015 or say what they did about it and haven't shared results of investigations into other apps,"" he wrote.Cambridge Analytica itself collapsed last year after saying it had been ""vilified"" for legal activities.However, questions continue to be asked about its links to Leave.EU's Brexit campaign.Mr Collins's committee published leaked emails related to the political consultancy's involvement in the referendum as recently as a fortnight ago."
technology	Facebook to stop stalking you off-site - but only if asked	Shared interests	"Facebook is drawing back the veil to show what data it collects on users.Many may not like what they see.A feature in settings called Off-Facebook Activity will show all the apps and websites that send information about you to Facebook, which is then used to target ads more effectively.You will also be able to clear your history and prevent your future off-app behaviour being tapped. But one expert said the move was unlikely to have a big impact on the firm's profits.For now, it is rolling out very slowly, with only Ireland, South Korea and Spain getting access. But the goal is to eventually offer it globally.The initiative comes at a time when Apple and Mozilla have already taken steps to prevent Facebook and other services from tracking users from one online platform to another via their browsers.In addition, Germany's competition regulator had told the firm it needed to substantially restrict the way it collected and combined data about its members unless it sought more explicit consent than it had done.Facebook collects data from beyond its platform either because you have opted to use the social media site to log in to an app or, more likely, because a website uses something called Facebook Pixel to track your activities.This is why when you browse a website for new shoes, you find an ad popping up in your Facebook Newsfeed half-an-hour later telling you about that nifty pair of boots you've just been looking at.The Off-Facebook Activity setting will let you drill down into exactly what data various apps or sites are sharing about you - Facebook says the average smartphone user has 80 apps and uses 40 of them every month, so the list could be long.You will then be able to disconnect the data from your Facebook profile - either the whole lot or singling out individual sources. If you take advantage of this, it should mean that those shoe ads stop following you across the internet in quite such a persistent fashion.It is important to stress that Facebook will still collect the data, but it will be anonymised - they may know that lots of people have been looking at those boots but they won't know that they include you.Off-Facebook Activity has been more than a year in the making and fulfils a pledge made by Mark Zuckerberg at last year's F8 developer conference to give users greater control over how their data is used.But how will users react to this feature - and what will it mean for Facebook's advertising business? I suspect that those people who do use it will be pretty horrified. It is one thing to know that in principle you are being tracked, quite another to see it in black and white.""This is how much of the internet works,"" says Facebook rather defensively in a blog about the new tool.And in a briefing Stephanie Max, the product manager behind it, made the unlikely claim that the reason it collected the data was to help users ""discover businesses they care about.""If millions of users do investigate this new setting and then decide to disconnect the data, then that in theory could prove damaging to advertisers and to Facebook's bottom line. How much impact would there be, we asked Stephanie Max, if say 20% of users shut down the link between this stream of data and their Facebook profiles?""We didn't do any modelling of that,"" she replied, going on to say that there was a lot of evidence that users valued having a personalised experience and that was intertwined with the way Facebook works currently.It would seem bizarre that Facebook would not have worked out in advance what impact this new transparency might have on its revenues, but the company may be right to be pretty relaxed.For one thing, it looks likely that finding and then acting on the Off-Facebook tool will be a very niche activity. For another, an expert on Facebook's advertising business says it is changing in ways that make the precise targeting of users less important.Mat Morrison, planning director at marketing agency Digital Whiskey, says advertisers are gradually waking up to the idea that targeting 23 year old men in High Wycombe who like mountain-biking and sushi is not that useful.""Agencies are trying to tell clients to calm down about nano-targeting,"" he explained.""When we began using Facebook data we could easily create nano-target audiences - only 20 people. Of course, this turns out to be a waste of everyone's time and money.""The story a few years ago was that the hugely expensive ad break in ITV's Coronation Street, which delivered a broad if poorly-defined audience, was being superseded by the precise targeting offered by social media ads.Now, says Morrison, the pendulum is swinging again and Facebook advertising is being valued for delivering a wide swathe of the population. ""Creating a broad consensus in the audience is what advertising has always been about,"" he says.So even if some of the Facebook population revolts against the constant tracking of their wider online activities - and remember the social media site will still have lots of data about them - it is unlikely that advertisers will desert what has become the prime destination for their messages.It is worth noting that two of the countries where the new setting is making its debut are in the European Union. The tech giant can show EU regulators that it is giving users more control over their data, without doing any damage to its ad revenues. Job done..."
technology	Facebook scam-busting service goes live	Taking advantage of loss'Negligent behaviour'	"Scammers are being targeted by a new tool for UK Facebook users that allows the reporting of fake adverts.The feature came about after Martin Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, sued over his name and photo being used on fake Facebook adverts.In return for dropping the legal action, Facebook agreed to donate £3m to set up an anti-scam programme.That money has been handed over to Citizens Advice to build a new service to help victims of online fraudsters.The charity has set up a telephone helpline for any type of online scam - not just ones involving fake ads. Face-to-face consultations will even be offered to serious cases - where someone falls into debt or mortgage arrears, for example.Citizens Advice says it expects to help 20,000 people in the first year of the new service, and warned anyone can be scammed.There is no typical profile of victims, the charity said, and scams are becoming more and more sophisticated. Some common red flags include:Inside Facebook, a specially-trained team has been set up to investigate adverts reported through the new tool.From Tuesday, Facebook users in the UK should be able to click the three dots in the top corner of every advert to see more options. On top of the usual ones, there will now be the option to ""send a detailed scam report"" after choosing to ""report ad"" and selecting ""misleading or scam ad"" as the reason.""Scam ads are an industry-wide problem caused by criminals and have no place on Facebook,"" said the company's vice-president for Northern Europe, Steve Hatch.A few years after her husband of 30 years died, Amanda - not her real name - joined an online dating site at the urging of a friend.After a while, she started exchanging emails with someone who seemed interesting. A few weeks later, ""he asked if I could send him some money"", she said.""He had not been paid and needed to travel back home from Ireland. I never thought much of it and transferred him the money.""The pair continued to build up ""a nice friendship over the months"" - and he asked for some money on a few other occasions.But something did not feel right - and Amanda decided not to message him any more.A few weeks later she got a new message from the dating site – with the same picture, but a different name and location.""That's when I realised that the person I had been speaking to was probably not the one on the picture,"" Amanda said.Over the course of a few months, she had transferred around £2,500 to whoever was really on the other end of those emails.""I think that maybe some of the men join the site knowing that there will be women like me who genuinely want a friendship and use that and take advantage of our loss,"" she said.The tool - and the dedicated team to examine the reports - are unique to the UK as a result of the lawsuit taken by Mr Lewis.The journalist and TV presenter took the legal action against Facebook after a series of ads ran with his face and name, claiming he backed questionable investment schemes.His website recommends what it believes are the best-value financial products for different purposes. Mr Lewis claimed the fake adverts on Facebook damaged his reputation.His defamation case, he said, was ""bizarrely the only law I could find to try to make big tech firms understand the damage their negligent behaviour has caused"".""Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don't. So now, I'd ask all who recognise them to use the new Facebook reporting tool, to help protect those who don't,"" he said.If you or someone you know has been scammed, Citizens Advice recommends you:"
technology	Facebook uses AI to map Thailand's roads		"Facebook has used artificial intelligence (AI) to map 300,000 miles of previously unmapped roads in Thailand and made the results available to the public.The project had been completed in 18 months, less than half the time it would have taken 100 mapping experts to do it manually, Facebook said.The maps could be used for disaster response and urban planning.Many parts of the world remain unmapped.The tool used for the project, Map With AI, is now being made available to all and includes access to AI-generated maps of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.Facebook plans to add more countries over time.The AI system uses satellite images with a resolution of two sq ft per pixel to distinguish roads from walkways or rivers.As part of the Thailand road-mapping project, human experts reviewed and corrected the road networks identified by the AI system.Facebook's desire to map the world is linked with its ambitions to expand rural internet access and add more users to its social network.The project is a collaboration with OpenStreetMap (OSM), built by a community of mappers who maintain data about roads, railways stations and other services around the world.Talking about the new AI tool, Martijn van Exel, a long time contributor to OSM, said: ""This is definitely going to be a key part of the future of OSM.""We can never map the world, and keep it mapped, without assistance from machines.""The trick is to find the sweet spot.""OSM is a people project and the map is a reflection of mappers' interests, skills, biases, et cetera.""That core tenet can never be lost but it can and must travel along with new horizons in mapping."""
technology	Flurry of Boris Johnson adverts tested on Facebook		"Hundreds of subtly different adverts featuring Boris Johnson have been run on Facebook since he became the UK's new prime minister.Facebook's advert library shows that the Conservatives have been testing a variety of subtly different messages.The practice is not unusual, but has become much easier to spot using Facebook's transparency tools.Other political parties, including the Labour Party, have also run similar tests in the past.""It is extremely common now, particularly among people who sell things online,"" said Rob Blackie, a digital strategist who works with non-profit organisations and political parties.""It's a good idea to do this. Typically, in every test you do, you find something that makes it 1% or 2% more efficient.""Accumulatively over time that can add up to an ad that is 40% or 50% more efficient.""The adverts for Mr Johnson were highlighted by Sky News correspondent Rowland Manthorpe, who suggested the party may be ""gathering data for an election"".Posting several slightly different adverts can help political parties learn which messages are resonating with voters, before spending more money promoting the most successful adverts.However, on Thursday, Mr Johnson denied he would call a general election, saying there had been ""enough elections"".The Conservatives are far from the first political party to test their advertising messages in this way.The Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed how Vote Leave had micro-targeted political adverts at Facebook users during the 2016 referendum.""Until very recently, you couldn't see what people were doing,"" said Mr Blackie.""But Facebook now allows you to see what ads people are putting up.""It has become more prominent with political parties, most campaigns have started to do this - although to do it well at scale can be quite time-consuming.""Specialised software can automatically create different combinations and pick out the winners, and shut down things that aren't working."""
technology	Facebook kids app flaw let strangers into chats		"A flaw with Facebook’s app for under-13s meant children came into contact with unapproved strangers, the company has confirmed.Messenger Kids, launched in 2017, was pegged as a safe space for children who were too young to use the “grown-up” version of the social network.The app was meant to only allow children to chat with friends who were approved by a parent.But a design flaw, first reported by The Verge, made it possible for unauthorised users - who may have been adults - to be part of group chats.""We recently notified some parents of Messenger Kids account users about a technical error that we detected affecting a small number of group chats,” the company confirmed on Monday.""We turned off the affected chats and provided parents with additional resources on Messenger Kids and online safety.”The Verge reported that “thousands” of parents had been sent the message warning them of the issue. The company would not provide a more specific estimate when asked by the BBC.Group chatsChildren using Messenger Kids can only talk to each other when a parent (or guardian) for each child approves the friendship. However, in a group chat, it was possible for a child to come into contact with a third person who, while approved by one child’s parent, was not approved by the other.Messenger Kids makes it possible for approved adults (usually a parent or other family member) to talk to children through the app, meaning it is possible that the unknown third person in a group chat could be an adult.A spokesperson for Facebook told the BBC the flaw was fixed immediately once discovered by Facebook, and the firm had not received any complaints about the problem from parents, or seen any evidence of inappropriate behaviour.However, the spokesman could not say how long the flaw had been active in the app, nor when Facebook became aware of it.Privacy fine incomingCommon Sense Media, a US non-profit which campaigns for children's safety online, said the flaw confirmed the fears it had about the app when it first launched.""Facebook Messenger Kids is just the latest example of a Facebook product that poses unknown privacy risks to parents and users,"" said James Steyer, founder and chief executive of Common Sense.""These ever-present privacy concerns, combined with many developmental experts' serious reservations about the impacts of social media on teens, raises the question of why we need a product designed to attract and engage young kids in the first place.""News of the flaw comes as Facebook awaits the final approval of a $5bn fine over recent privacy violations. The penalty, from the US Federal Trade Commission, is expected to be announced this week, and may include additional privacy oversight for the firm._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Pluribus: Facebook heralds its 'superhuman' poker-playing AI		"Facebook’s artificial intelligence team has made what it describes as a “superhuman” poker champion, a bot with the ability to beat world-leading human pros.Facebook is heralding the AI bot, named Pluribus, as a major breakthrough: the first capable of beating as many as six players, in a game that involves “hidden” information - the cards that are yet to be revealed.The team’s research also makes humbling reading for any poker players proud of their ability to spot a “tell”.“We think of bluffing as this very human trait,” explained Noam Brown, the lead researcher from Facebook’s AI team, speaking to BBC News.“But what we see is that bluffing is actually mathematical behaviour. When the bot ‘bluffs’, it doesn’t view it as deceptive or dishonest, it’s just the way to make the most money.”Mr Brown said neither he nor Facebook had any plans to use the AI in real poker games. Indeed, the firm has said it is not publicly disclosing much of the code for fear of having a negative impact on the poker community. It would, a spokesman said, provide examples of techniques to other researchers working on AI. A research paper has been published in the journal Science.Beyond poker, Mr Brown would not be drawn on what practical use Facebook might have in mind for the technology.“My research is focused on advancing the fundamentals,” he said.“Everything from cyber-security, to fraud-detection, to navigating traffic with self-driving cars - this research could be fundamental.”Cheaper techniqueFacebook created a model in which the AI would play hands against itself “trillions” of times once being programmed with the game’s rules, a technique referred to as “reinforcement learning”. In other words, practice makes (almost) perfect.One notable achievement, Mr Brown said, was the comparatively low amount of computing power needed to train and run Pluribus.The AI needed just $150-worth of cloud computing resources to work. Similar efforts, from Google’s AI research shop Deepmind, have relied on supercomputers consisting of more than 5,000 specialist processors, at a reported cost of millions of dollars. Reducing the computing power necessary for AI experiments is seen as a key hurdle to the technology’s development, with the computing power needed currently exceeding the rate at which processors are getting more efficient.Mr Brown said just 20 hours of learning was needed to programme the AI up to the ability of a world-beating poker professional. On average, the bot was making $1,000 per hour when playing against five humans. As part of its Facebook’s announcement for the new technology, Facebook quoted several human poker champions who had been invited to play against the AI.“Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,” said Chris Ferguson, a World Series of Poker champion.""It’s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand.”The work will likely make the team popular among the AI researchers that have been trying to create a poker-playing AI for more than a decade, but Mr Brown said he was unclear how such advancements might go down in the casino business.“I was in Las Vegas just last week,” he joked. “But they didn’t know about these results. I’ll have to go back.""_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Facebook may be 'pivoting' to something worse	Hidden from view	"Over the past few months, Mark Zuckerberg has spoken at length about his grand plan for fixing Facebook.In short, it involves “pivoting” - as they say - to a more private social network. One which focuses on closed spaces, like groups or messaging, rather than the public News Feed.He unveiled this plan in March, a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit.At the time, I noted that critics were concerned that the shift would mean Facebook was abdicating some of its responsibilities. Making Facebook more private would arguably not remove the problems of abuse - though it would make it harder for outsiders to find instances of Facebook’s failures.Recent stories have demonstrated that concern was perhaps justified.On Monday, ProPublica revealed the existence of a private Facebook group which contained disturbing jokes allegedly posted by US Border Patrol agents.The investigative site said comments included mockery of migrants that had died in custody, as well as aggressive, sexist remarks about prominent female politicians. The group has existed for more three years and has almost 10,000 members.A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. Our community standards apply across Facebook, including in secret groups. We're co-operating with federal authorities in their investigation.""Separately, a report last month from California-based investigative group Reveal exposed groups where police officers, from more than 50 different departments across the country, shared racist memes, islamophobia and conspiracy theories.And the Washington Post detailed a flurry of groups offering bogus cancer treatment “advice”, such as to ""use baking soda or frankincense” instead of chemotherapy. These groups are able and allowed to flourish - the Post reported at least two with more than 100,000 members.Facebook said it provides related news stories to posts that might contain misinformation, but we don’t have any statistics on how effective this measure is.(Facebook has, however, banned some women who had shared mastectomy scars as an act of solidarity and encouragement with others facing their own battle with cancer.)What makes these examples of abuse more significant than what we’ve seen in the past? They show how Facebook’s strategy has the ability to push its problems into the shadows.ProPublica was only able to observe the Border Patrol group thanks to someone sending them screenshots - otherwise it was entirely hidden from view.Reveal had to use specially-written software code that cross-referenced members of hate groups against users who were signed up to legitimate pages about police work.The Washington Post reporter was able to access some groups, but was swiftly banned and blocked when it became clear who she was.Even Facebook finds it more difficult to find itself accountable when it comes to groups.The site has said its ability to use algorithms and AI to detect hate speech and misinformation still falls short, and therefore it still relies heavily on users reporting inappropriate content.In groups, this of course becomes far less likely: the inappropriate content is the reason people joined the group in the first place. And Facebook has shown limited willingness to proactively look for these kind of abuses itself.Groups have, of course, been a feature on Facebook since the early days. But never before have they had such prominence.Facebook, as directed by its leader, is aggressively pushing users to use groups more often. There’s an advertising campaign - which includes hand-painted murals - and a new button placed front and centre in its mobile app. Private is the new public.“This vision could backfire terribly,” warned French journalism professor, Frederick Pilloux, in 2018. “An increase in the weight of 'groups' means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features -  cognitive bubbles -  where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism.”Make no mistake: few, if any, of the problems Facebook is “working hard” on at the moment would have come to light were it not for external pressure from journalists, lawmakers, academics and civil rights groups.The examples I’ve raised here pose a question: is Facebook fixing itself, or merely making it harder for us to see it's broken?_______Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Sir Tim Berners-Lee attacks Tories over misinformation	Better futureOptimism	"The inventor of the World Wide Web has accused the Conservatives of spreading misinformation during the general election campaign.Sir Tim Berners-Lee described the renaming of a Tory Twitter account as a fact checking body as ""impersonation"".""That was really brazen,"" he told the BBC. ""It was unbelievable they would do that.""During a live TV leaders' debate on Tuesday the Tory press office account @CCHQ was rebranded ""factcheckuk"".The renaming remained for the duration of the hour-long debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The Conservatives have said ""no one will have been fooled"" by the move.But Sir Tim said the renaming ""was impersonation. Don't do that. Don't trust people who do that.""He went on to compare what happened with someone impersonating a friend for the purpose of defrauding them. ""What the Conservative Party has done is obviously a no no. That's amazingly blatant,"" Sir Tim said.The Conservative Party has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment on Sir Tim's criticism, but has previously insisted that it was clear at all times that the Twitter account belonged to the party.The web's creator also called on Facebook to stop allowing targeted political adverts. He issued a personal appeal to the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to ban them before the election.Sir Tim said: ""It's not fair to risk democracy by allowing all these very subtle manipulations with targeted ads which promote completely false ideas. They do it just before the election, and then disappear.""He was speaking as he unveiled Contract For The Web, an attempt to bring governments, companies and individuals together to shape a better future for the online world.The contract sets out nine principles to halt the misuse of the web and protect it as a force for good. They include making the internet freely available and affordable, and respecting consumers' privacy and their data.A handful of countries have been involved in drawing up the contract, along with companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. .Sir Tim admitted that countries such as China and Russia were unlikely to sign up to the project. He also conceded that the US might not be too keen on a document which stresses the importance of net neutrality, the principle that internet providers should treat all net traffic equally.The Trump administration has sought to overturn net neutrality rules brought in under President Obama.""The current administration hasn't shown any interest in signing up to those kinds of principles,"" he said. But he pointed out that elections were coming up in the UK and the US and urged people to talk to candidates about the Contract for the Web.Thirty years after he created the World Wide Web at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva, Sir Tim admits that he is concerned about the way it has developed in recent years.As for any optimism about what comes next, he is uncertain: ""If optimism is seeing a place where it could be, which is very empowering to individuals and to humanity. Yes. I am very optimistic. If optimism is being very confident that we will get there - I'm not.""The Web Foundation, which has spent the last year drawing up the detailed clauses behind the Contract for the Web, will now work to get more governments and companies to sign up to it."
technology	Facebook to identify French hate speech suspects		"Facebook has agreed to give the names of French users who are suspected of using hate speech on its platform to the courts when requested.The deal is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.In the past, the tech giant has revealed IP addresses and other forms of identification to French judges - but only in cases relating to terrorism and violent acts.Cedric O, French minister for digital affairs, called the deal ""huge news"".Illegal hate speech is defined by the European Commission as public conduct that incites violence or hatred to groups of people defined by characteristics such as race, religion, and ethnic origin.Mr O said the deal was the result of conversations between Facebook and the French government.""This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,"" Mr O told the news website Reuters. ""It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.""According to Reuters, Facebook had not identified people suspected of hate speech in the past because it was not required to do so under US-French law - and because it was worried some countries could abuse requests for data.The French parliament is currently debating laws which could see tech companies fined up to 4% of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their platforms.Germany implemented a similar law in January 2018 under which large social networks have 24 hours to remove ""obviously illegal"" material after they are notified about it - or face fines of up to £44m."
technology	Facebook quizzed in court on EU-US data transfers		"Facebook's method of transferring data from the EU to the US for business purposes is being challenged again in court.The Irish data protection commissioner is arguing that the legal mechanism for these transfers does not sufficiently protect EU citizens' right to privacy.The concern is such transfers could be subject to mass surveillance by US intelligence agencies.Facebook said data protection safeguards were in place.The challenge was prompted by privacy activist Max Schrems, who had previously taken Facebook to court over the so-called Safe Harbor data-transfer agreement.He has been tweeting from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Luxembourg, revealing that he thinks it could take until ""the end of the year"" for the case to be resolved.A ruling against Facebook could potentially undermine the basis on which many businesses send data across the Atlantic - particularly technology giants that rely on cloud computing and communications technology.Currently, the social network transfers vast amounts of personal data about EU users to servers in the US - everything from people's names to information about their activity online.In 2013, documents published by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden suggested Facebook was a target of ""Prism"", a US National Security Agency's mass surveillance programme.The alternative legal framework Facebook has used since is called ""standard contractual clauses"" (SCCs).But the Irish data protection commissioner has suggested that SCCs are not fit for purpose given the possibility of intelligence agency surveillance.Should the CJEU decide that SCCs are indeed problematic, the ruling would have huge ramifications for Facebook and other businesses, said legal expert Orla Lynskey, at the London School of Economics.""That would have a very significant impact for companies,"" she told BBC News.""The big question is, when assessing whether or not data can go to third countries [outside the EU], should we be taking into consideration potential access by intelligence or law enforcement agencies?""Jack Gilbert, associate general counsel for Facebook, said the social network was ""grateful"" for the consideration of the CJEU.""Standard contractual clauses provide important safeguards to ensure that Europeans' data are protected once transferred overseas,"" he said.""SCCs have been designed and endorsed by the European Commission and enable thousands of Europeans to do business worldwide."""
technology	Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg 'survives' leadership vote	'Too much power'	"An attempt to make Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg step down as the company's chairman has failed.At the company's annual general meeting on Thursday, shareholders had the opportunity to vote on Mr Zuckerberg's leadership.Mr Zuckerberg is both Facebook's chief executive and the chairman of its board of directors.He controls about 60% of the voting power and would only have lost if he voted against himself.Some investors have called for him to step down as chairman as they believe this would help him focus on running the company.One of those investors is Trillium Asset Management, which owns Facebook shares worth about $7m (£5.5m).""If he can focus on being the CEO, and let somebody else focus on being independent board chair, that would be a much better situation,"" Jonas Kron, senior vice-president at Trillium, told the BBC ahead of the vote.He said Mr Zuckerberg could take inspiration from Google's Larry Page and Microsoft's Bill Gates, who are company founders but not chairman of the board.Despite more than a year of privacy and data protection scandals, Facebook has exceeded estimates for revenue growth and continues to add new members.At the annual general meeting, Mr Zuckerberg declined to answer a shareholder question about why he would not appoint an independent chairman of the board.He repeated his view that regulators should set the rules around privacy and content for Facebook to follow.A small number of demonstrators appeared outside the AGM, arguing that Facebook did not protect its users, particularly people from minority groups. Counter-demonstrators argued that Facebook ""censored conservative voices"".According to the Reuters news agency, some shareholders at the AGM said Facebook was a ""hostile work environment"" for people with conservative views. Some have asked the company to produce a diversity report reflecting its public policy positions.Facebook's former security chief Alex Stamos has also called for Mr Zuckerberg to step down as chief executive.""There's a legit[imate] argument that he has too much power,"" Mr Stamos told the Collision Conference in Canada in May.Mr Zuckerberg previously defended his leadership of Facebook.In April, he said: ""When you're building something like Facebook, which is unprecedented in the world, there are things that you're going to mess up.""What I think people should hold us accountable for is if we are learning from our mistakes."""

""Please sign up for my mailing list before this account disappears.""A spokesperson at Facebook said the ban will apply to all types of representation of the individuals on both Facebook and Instagram.The firm said it would remove pages, groups and accounts set up to represent them, and would not allow the promotion of events when it knows the banned individual is participating.In an email, Facebook explained its rationale for banning the users:_______Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Apple bans Hong Kong protest location app	'Sucking up'	"Apple has rejected a crowd-sourced app that tracks the location of protesters and police in Hong Kong.For some, the app was seen as a way for protesters to stay safe, while others saw it as a way to evade the police.Apple told app creators it ""facilitates, enables, or encourages an activity that is not legal"" - but it is still available on Google's app store.Apple has not said whether the decision to ban it was in response to a request from the Chinese authorities.The matter was brought to the wider public's attention by the Register news site.Tensions in Hong Kong have risen in recent weeks, with one protester shot by local police this week in his chest.The 18-year-old was taken to hospital with what the police said was an injury ""near his left shoulder"".Police chief Stephen Lo said that firing the bullet was ""lawful and reasonable"".HKmap Live gathers reports from chat app Telegram to show users the locations of spots where the police are patrolling and areas where tear gas has been deployed.Explaining its rejection, Apple said it ""allowed users to evade law enforcement"".But the app is still currently available on Google's app store and on the web.In a tweet in response to the decision, the app's developers said they believed it was a bureaucratic error rather than censorship.""Everything can be used for illegal purpose on the wrong hand. Our app is for info, and we do not encourage illegal activity,"" they said.But not everyone had such a benevolent view.Techno-sociologist Prof Zeynep Tufekci, said that many other mapping apps could be used for the same purpose,""It reports locations and does nothing else. Maybe this really is Apple sucking up to China,"" she tweeted.In the discussion below her tweet, someone else pointed out that families with children used the app to avoid areas where tear gas was being used.Chinese owned video-sharing platform TikTok has also been accused of censoring content about the protests in Hong Kong.Correction 7 October 2019: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Apple had removed the app from its store, when in fact it had not been published to the platform."
technology	Few convinced by Apple's case for Hong Kong app removal	‘Innocent passers-by’Censored South ParkExerting power	"As if piling up sandbags before a flood, Apple was well prepared to face a backlash over its decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters.But the firm’s carefully-worded statement offering its reasoning has left China watchers, politicians - and some famed Apple supporters - wholly unconvinced.“Apple’s decision to cave to Communist China’s demands is unacceptable,” tweeted Rick Scott, a Republican senator for Florida.“Putting profits above the human rights and dignity of the people of Hong Kong is wrong. No ifs, ands or buts about it.”Late on Wednesday, the firm started briefing journalists on the move, pushing its view that the HKmap.live was being “used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents”.On Thursday morning, Apple chief executive Tim Cook posted an internal memo.“It’s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision,” he wrote.“Over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.“Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.”Long-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cook’s email: “I can’t recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny.”Apple has yet to provide any additional information about those claimed incidents. Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator who represents the IT industry in the territory, posted a letter to Mr Cook on Twitter.“There are numerous cases of innocent passers-by in the neighbourhood injured by the Kong Kong Police Force’s excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,” he wrote.“The user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.”Mr Mok went on to argue that users on major social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also share information about police activity - but were not being held to the same standard.“We Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.”Apple has not responded to the letter.Apple’s decision comes against a backdrop of major American firms being seen as bowing to political pressure from Beijing.In just the past week, the NBA grovelled its way around a tweet from a team executive supporting the protests, while video games published Activision Blizzard banned e-sports competitor Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung for showing his support for the movement.And Google removed a role-playing game called “Revolution of Our Times” from its app store after deeming it violated its policies on depicting “sensitive events” (the player plays the role of a Hong Kong protester). According to the Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong authorities had contacted Google with concerns about that app - though the company has said it decided to take action before any communication took place.One bucking of the trend, however, came via Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the firm behind online multiplayer game Fortnite.“Epic supports everyone’s right to speak freely,” he wrote on Twitter, in response to a question about gamers voicing support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns 40% of the firm.“China players of Fortnite are free to criticize the US or criticize Epic just as equally as all others,” Mr Sweeney said.In characteristically astute timing, an episode of Comedy Central’s South Park earlier this month led Chinese censors to “delete virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages”, according to the Hollywood Reporter.The episode featured four of the show’s main characters working on a film script that gets constantly altered so that it could be distributed in China.“Well you know what they say,” the film’s director in the show says, “You gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.”In Apple’s case that means revenues that are on course to exceed $40bn this year - almost a fifth of the firm’s total global sales. Apple’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing means the relationship goes far deeper than just local sales. The firm has 10,000 direct employees in the firm; the economy around Apple’s presence in China is responsible for around 5m jobs.What happens next depends on the extent to which China feels its hardline stance is working - and there are indications officials are becoming wary. According to reporting in the New York Times, Beijing is concerned its actions are drawing more attention to the protests and harming the country’s standing on the global stage, adding yet more tension to relations with the US as trade talks restart in Washington.The rows have also bolstered concerns that China has few qualms when it comes to making demands of companies both based in the Communist state, as well as those who merely want to do business there.“What would Huawei do if they were the dominant 5G provider for a country, and that country’s leaders said the wrong thing?” speculated Elliott Zaagman, who covers Chinese business and investment,_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Apple responds to iPhone factory criticism	Analysis: Kerry Allen, Chinese media analyst, BBC News	"Apple has responded to a report by a campaign group which criticised working conditions at a factory where iPhones are made.According to the report, Foxconn workers were not getting bonuses, were being made to do overtime and too many temporary workers were being hired.Under Chinese law, only 10% of a workforce can be temporary.Apple admitted the number of temporary staff ""exceeded [its] standards"" but denied the other claims.The campaign group, China Labor Watch, said its investigators had spent time working in the factory in Zhengzhou, and one person on the team had been there for more than four years.It claimed that 50% of the staff in the factory were temporary, some of them students, and were not receiving promised bonuses.""We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labour,"" Apple said in a statement.Last month, Amazon said it would investigate after similar claims were made by China Labor Watch about the number of teenage interns working long hours to manufacture Echo devices, also in Foxconn factories.Foxconn said it had reviewed its operations and had found ""some workforce compliance issues"" that it was addressing.""At no time did we find any evidence of forced labour and we can confirm that this facility currently has no interns working overtime,"" it said in a statement given to AFP.Foxconn manufactures the iPhone, as well as other electronic devices for other brands.Thousands in China took to social media platform Weibo to share their thoughts about the report.Many believed Apple rather than Foxconn was at fault, while others were critical of Chinese labour laws.There were discussions about the controversial ""996"" working hour system in China - the idea that workers, predominantly in tech, work 09:00 - 21:00, 6 days a week.Many users asked why the authorities had not done enough to prevent labour infringements, and described existing labour law as ""a joke"".Others said that such hours had simply become the reality. They added that high levels of temporary workers in August were perhaps to be expected, given that it's the summer holiday, and students (many of whom don't work during their studies) are squeezing in some work experience.Coming in the middle of a huge media campaign to promote buying locally, rather than relying on US products, others said they would rather buy a Huawei phone anyway."
technology	Apple's iPhone 11 Pro 'triggering' fear of holes		"People with a fear of small holes have claimed the design of Apple's iPhone 11 Pro is triggering their phobia.At its unveiling on Tuesday, many found their attention drawn to its ""ultra-wide"" rear camera, with three high-powered lenses packed closely together.The lenses sit alongside the handset's torch and ""audio zoom"" microphone.And hundreds of smartphone users now claim the new design has triggered their ""trypophobia"", an aversion to the sight of clusters of small holes.The term ""trypophobia"" was first coined in 2005 in online forum Reddit and it has since become widely talked about on social media.American Horror Story actress Sarah Paulson and model Kendall Jenner are among those who say they have the condition.Vision scientist Dr Geoff Cole, at the University of Essex, was part of the first full scientific study of trypophobia, working with his colleague, Prof Arnold Wilkins.""We have all got it, it's just a matter of degree,"" Dr Cole told BBC News earlier this year.The response to seeing small holes can be very extreme, their study suggests.Dr Cole and Prof Wilkins reported testimonies from some people who vomited and others who said they could not go to work for several days.""It can be quite disabling,"" Prof Wilkins added."
technology	Trump’s tariffs puts Apple’s golden goose at risk	Waiting gameFragility	The iPhone launch is the most important date in Apple’s calendar. At least it would be, in a normal year. In 2019, it’s 15 December that matters most for America’s richest company.That’s when Donald Trump has threatened to impose a sweeping new round of trade tariffs against imports from China. According to analysis by Reuters, it would mean 92% of hardware sold by Apple would face levies.Apple is of course desperate to not let this happen, and has been lobbying hard to be granted exemptions. That effort has been somewhat successful, and it is the reason why the company has been relatively unscathed until now: only this month did tariffs have an impact on “major” Apple products, the Apple Watch and AirPods.Those products are important, but not the golden goose - wearable devices make up less than 9% of Apple’s total sales. The iPhone, however, represents 55.6% of Apple’s business. While the importance of the iPhone has been declining due to a drop in smartphone sales (in general) around the world, it’s still by far the most important device Apple makes.Two years ago Apple made a bold (and ridiculed, at first) decision to fatten its goose. It increased the price of the iPhone, breaking the $1,000 barrier for the first time. Consumers went for it, and Apple was able to offset declining sales of the device by instead making considerably more on each one.And that’s what the tariffs put at risk - those healthy profit margins. If the tariffs are indeed imposed in December, it could mean several outcomes - none of which Apple will be particularly keen on, explained Alberto Cavallo, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.“Most people assume that we will see the tariffs reflected in consumer prices,” he said.“That’s not necessarily the case. Companies facing higher costs can choose to absorb those costs.”And that’s what most financial analysts expect Apple to do, keeping this year’s crop of iPhones set at the same prices as last year ($749, $999 and $1,099). Should the tariffs arrived as threatened, Apple will just have to suck it up.Then it becomes a waiting game: how long will this trade war and its tariffs last? Could the tariffs get worse?Apple, it was reported earlier this year, is investigating ways it can move production out of China, avoiding the tariffs altogether. It already makes devices in places such as India and Brazil, but that’s typically to handle local demand in those countries - not making devices to send overseas. Ramping up these operations will take a long time, Prof Cavallo said.“I think it’s important for consumers to understand it’s not an automatic thing. It’s not exactly like flicking a switch.”President Trump would tell you the way to handle this would be to move manufacturing back to the USA - “America First”, and all that. But the costs of doing that could dwarf the impact of the tariffs in the first place. It’s not just a case of building a factory, but training a brand new workforce of talented fingers, fingers that will require higher wages and better conditions.The manufacturing of Apple products directly and indirectly accounts for around 3 million jobs in China. For that reason, Prof Cavallo said, one other possible scenario might be that Apple’s suppliers might offer a discount at their end in order to keep hold of that business.Apple will also continue to develop the side of its business that won’t be affected by import tariffs. That’s basically anything that’s not hardware, referred to by Apple as its Services Division. Services will be a big focus for Apple on Tuesday and beyond - the most significant move being the launch of its on-demand TV service, Apple TV+.“We believe $10 per month will be the initial launch service fee offered to Apple customers,” said Dan Ives, a financial analyst, adding that Apple would probably offer bundle deals for TV and other services, such as Music.“If Apple executes with minimal speed bumps and aggressively acquires content given the company’s massive installed base and unmatched brand loyalty we believe reaching the 100 million subscriber number in the medium term (three to five years) is a realistic goal that could translate into a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time for Apple.”Yet, as if to underline the fragility of Big Tech right now, even this seemingly more straightforward side of Apple’s business faces uncertainty, as regulators and the US and EU intensify their investigations into alleged anti-competitive behaviour. The specific accusation against Apple is that it uses its dominance in hardware to push its own apps and services over that of its competitors. For example, ranking Apple Music higher on the App Store than rival streaming service Spotify. Any changes to what Apple is able to do with and on its own devices could make its Services division less valuable.And so, for the company that craves control, the immediate future could be an uncomfortable period. And if it lasts too long, a transformative one.Or, and this is a scenario that can never be discounted, President Trump could suddenly change his mind and we can just forget all this ever happened._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Apple's iPhone 11 Pro and 'always-on' Watch unveiled	Camera featuresSlowing demandGlobal smartphone shipmentsSubscription servicesHow phone cameras evolved:	"Apple has unveiled its iPhone 11 range of handsets, which feature more cameras than before and a processor that has been updated to be faster while consuming less power.The company said the two Pro models would last between four to five hours longer than their XS predecessors.But it did not launch a 5G model, and some rumoured features were missing.Apple also revealed a new version of its smartwatch, which features an ""always on"" display for the first time.The Series 5 Watch adjusts how often it refreshes the screen to as little as one frame per second as well as dimming the image to promise the same 18-hour battery life as the previous version.It also introduces a compass as well as the option of a titanium case. Its new operating system will alert owners to when nearby noise rises to risky levels, and adds menstrual cycle-tracking.""I love strategically where Apple is going with its health and safety capabilities, but was disappointed to not see a sleep study or feature mentioned,"" commented analyst Patrick Moorhead.The company added that it will keep its Series 3 model on the market, which will cost $199 - or £199 in the UK - marking a new entry price point for the wearable.Apple currently accounts for 49% of the global smartwatch market, according to research firm IDC.It is also the UK's top-selling smartphone brand by a wide margin.The new iPhones are notable for introducing an ""ultrawide"" rear camera, offering 2x optical zoom-out.The Pro models retain the telephoto and normal lenses found in the last generation's XS and XS Max, while the basic iPhone 11 only has an ultrawide and standard lens.Apple made a virtue of a new Night Mode, which automatically brightens the image when required while taking steps to minimise the digital noise produced as a result.Google, Samsung and Huawei had already introduced a similar feature to their handsets.A new facility called Deep Fusion was also teased. It takes nine snaps with a variety of exposures and then picks through them ""pixel by pixel"" to combine the best parts from each to create a superior image.This will not, however, be available at launch but should be added via a software update before the year's end.Other enhancements include the ability to shoot slow-motion videos with the front camera.The handsets' processor - the A13 Bionic - has also been upgraded.Apple claims its CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) are more powerful than those featured in any Android phone.In addition, the chip's ""neural engine"" has been optimised to better handle matrix calculations - a type of algebra used by neural networks - and is said to be 20% faster than the A12.However, the new models are not compatible with Apple's Pencil stylus, as had been expected by many. That feature was already offered by its lowest-end iPad.Nor can they wirelessly recharge other devices, unlike Samsung and Huawei's premium phones.The handsets also stick with having lightning ports rather than making the shift to USB-C, as has happened with the iPad Pro - which could have made faster data transfers possible.The iPhone 11 is slightly cheaper than its XR forerunner in the UK, ranging between £729 and £879 depending on the amount of storage.But the Pro models are more expensive than the XS ones, costing between £1,049 and £1,499.They go on sale in 10 days time.Apple experienced a bigger drop in demand for new handsets than many of its rivals over the past year.But the firm recently reported that its active install base - the number of iPhones in use - was at an ""all time high"".""Several forces play here,"" commented Marta Pinto from IDC.""Apple designs devices that last longer than an average Android device, and it's been very good at rolling out new versions of its operating system.""There's also a very good second-hand trade in iPhones, and the overall smartphone market is slowing down.""But Apple doesn't mind because its focus is now turning to services, and its wearables are also doing well.""The new iPhone line-up does not feature a 5G model, in part because Intel struggled to develop the required modem.At a time when consumers are holding onto their handsets for longer before upgrading, that could place a further constraint on sales - especially in countries where 5G networks have already launched, such as the UK.""Given people's loyalty to iPhone, if they really want 5G they'll probably just wait,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.""That said, don't be surprised to see rivals, particularly Samsung, positioning 5G devices as 'future-proof' options.""I'm sure they will be arguing that buying a premium priced 4G smartphone right now would be like buying a TV a few years ago that was not HD-Ready.""Earlier at the event, chief executive Tim Cook revealed that Apple's two forthcoming subscription services would each cost $4.99 - or £4.99 in the UK - per month.Apple Arcade - a video games deal offering exclusive access to games that do not feature in-app fees - will become available on 19 September.It will be followed by Apple TV+ - a television programme and movie-streaming platform with content not available elsewhere - which will make its first shows available on 1 November.The latter will be cheaper than rival services from Disney and Netflix, but appears to promise less material at this stage.""I applaud web access to Apple TV+, but would have preferred an Android and Windows app,"" commented Mr Moorhead.There was no mention of Apple bundling the new services with its existing cloud storage, news and music offerings for a discount, as had been speculated.But it will offer one year's Apple TV+ membership to consumers buying one of its computers or set-top boxes.In addition, the company unveiled a new iPad.The seventh generation model has a 10.2in (25.9cm) screen - making it bigger than before - and will go on sale at the end of the month.It will start at £349, a £30 increase on the earlier model.It has now been nearly 13 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone.Apple has since become one of the world's most valuable companies, in part because of investors' hopes that it can pull off a similar trick.""Everyone wants Apple to have a new 'wow' product and its got a pretty good track record,"" commented Mr Wood.""But the next big hit is proving elusive right now. My money is still on smart glasses but I think it could still be years before we see anything.""These updates are less about bringing in new features, but enhancing the things we're already familiar with.The iPhone Pro's camera setup is being aimed at - as you might guess - professionals. I think Apple sees big potential in indie filmmakers and documentary-makers. The battery-life bump should also help.Apple TV+ is cheap compared to its competitors. But is it good value?Disney+, Netflix, HBO et al have huge back catalogues of loved TV shows and movies. Apple doesn't, or at least it's not clear what it will have, even one year from now.All Apple really has is a boatload of cash to fill up Apple TV+ with content it hopes people will like. We've seen no evidence, yet, that it's capable of fulfilling that goal.Giving one year's access away with new devices is a way of making sure those new shows have wide exposure - but it needs to convince the entertainment industry that it's worth making a show for Apple+ instead of its rivals.Kyocera VP-210 VisualPhone (1999)Although there is some dispute over which mobile first featured a built-in colour camera, many credit this handset as having the honour. It featured a 0.11 megapixel (MP) sensor and could only store 20 selfies, but was able to transmit a jerky video feed in real-time at about two frames per second.Sharp J-SH04 (2000)Sharp's first photo-snapping mobile placed its sensor on the rear of its handset to encourage its use as an alternative to standard cameras. Its 0.11MP snaps could then be sent to friends via email.Sony Ericsson T68i (2002)The handset's optional CommuniCam MCA-20 accessory snapped on to the bottom of the handset, helping keep down the phone's size when not in use. It was limited to taking VGA (0.3MP) resolution shots, but the images could be texted to others via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) if they had compatible phones.Samsung D500 (2004)This was one of the first handsets to offer more than one megapixel of image quality. What's more it had a flash. Meanwhile the software made it possible to add graphical frames around photos and turn images sepia or apply a ""negative"" effect.Nokia N90 (2005)Nokia's N90 had a somewhat clunky swivel design, but a two megapixel sensor and a lens developed in collaboration with the famed German optics firm Carl Zeiss pitched it firmly at camera enthusiasts.Samsung G800 (2007)The megapixel wars were well under way by the time Samsung unveiled the G800. It took 5MP shots, had a 3x optical zoom and even featured a lens-cover slider, meaning that from the rear it could be easily mistaken for a dedicated camera.iPhone 4 (2010)Apple's fourth-generation iPhone is widely credited with helping kickstart the selfie craze, despite being far from the first to have a front camera. But at its launch, Steve Jobs was keener to show off how the feature could be used for Facetime, the firm's video chat app.LG Optimus 3D (2011)Smartphones with two rear cameras were still a rarity when LG's Android phone went on sale. It used them to create 3D images that could be viewed without special glasses on its display. But 3D phones proved to be as unpopular as 3D TVs, marking an evolutionary dead end for the industry.HTC One (2013)HTC's 2013 flagship sought to shift the battle to low-light photography. To do this it made the pixels larger than normal to gather more light, and dubbed them ""ultrapixels"". The trade-off was that its photos were limited to 4MP.Nokia Lumia 1020 (2014)This Windows Phone featured an industry-leading 41MP sensor attached to an optical image stabilisation system. It allowed users to zoom in and crop without worrying about images becoming blurred, or to combine the data to make 5MP photos with less visual noise than would otherwise be the case.Lenovo Phab2Pro (2016)This was the first handset to build in Google's doomed Project Tango depth and motion-sensing cameras. They made augmented reality features possible, such as superimposing graphical images of furniture into views of a room. Tango was short-lived, but AR has lived on by other means.Samsung Note 8 (2017)This was one of the first phones to feature ""live focus"" - a facility that allowed users to adjust background blur in their photos before or after taking them. It achieved this by comparing the view from each of its two rear cameras to create a depth map of the scene.iPhone X (2017)Apple's tenth anniversary handset introduced its Face ID camera system, which used tens of thousands of infrared dots to map the user's features. As a consequence, the display had to make space for a ""notch"", which was widely copied by rivals even if they didn't feature such an elaborate facial recognition system.Pixel 2 (2017)Google found a way to let users blur the background of their photos using a single camera in its second-generation Pixel. This made it possible to offer the effect from both its front-facing selfie camera as well as the rear sensor.Huawei P20 Pro (2018)The Chinese firm's phone was one of the first to feature three cameras on its back. But the standout feature was its ability to produce quality snaps in near-dark conditions by taking long-exposure snaps and then using machine learning software to keep the details crisp.Oppo Reno 10x Zoom (2019)This had two unusual camera features. Firstly, one of the rear cameras has a periscope design that directs light sideways into the device's body, making it possible to let users zoom into a shot more than usual without sacrificing detail. Secondly, the selfie camera pops up from the top, making more space for the display."
technology	Apple, angry at Google, hits back at hack claims		"Last week Google disclosed a large-scale hacking effort that it said targeted users of Apple devices. It was a bombshell story.But now Apple has gone on the attack - angry in public, and absolutely incensed in private at what is being seen as something of a stitch up. Google is standing by its research.In a statement posted on Friday, Apple took issue with Google’s characterisation that this was a broad attack on all iPhone users.""Google’s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of 'mass exploitation' to 'monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,' stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised,” it reads.""This was never the case.”Apple’s bone of contention isn’t so much about what Google’s Project Zero team included in its report. Rather, Apple is upset about what was left out. The view from Cupertino is that Google’s business interests in China led it to pull back on describing the attack as being targeted at the persecuted Uighur community.""The sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones 'en masse' as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community.”Android affectedThis perspective is backed up by independent research from Volexity, a cyber-security firm based in Washington DC. It published a report earlier this month looking into the same threat, and stated unequivocally that Uighurs were the target - detailing 11 websites that had been used to carry out the attack.Most notably, the Volexity report states that as well as Apple’s iOS, Google’s own mobile operating system, Android, was also targeted - a detail that was missing from Google’s research.Google insists it didn’t know Android was affected - but it’s well aware how it looks.Tim Willis, a researcher on the Project Zero team, wrote in a tweet that Google’s Threat Analysis Group ""only saw iOS exploitation on these sites when TAG found them back in Jan 2019 (and yes, they looked for everything else as well)”.The independent researchers I’ve spoken to are mostly giving Project Zero the benefit of the doubt on that point. It’s a highly respected group in the cyber-security space, and hasn’t been seen as some kind of weapon against Google’s rivals. Besides, this isn’t exactly the first time it’s found something involving Apple - the group has reported over 200 vulnerabilities to the company to date, most without this kind of fanfare or controversy.""Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies,” a spokesperson said.""We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.”Skin in the gameBut there are big questions about how Google is handling the dreaded “C” word: China. There’s no mention of the country in Project Zero’s research, and a spokesman on Friday wouldn’t tell me if Google had known the Uighurs were being targeted. But given the researchers said they’d identified various web addresses affected, it seems very unlikely that two-and-two were not put together. One of the URLs, to give you an example, was quite clearly a news site aimed at Uighur readers, or at least those interested in their plight.Google has form in this area. You may remember a story last month regarding China-backed misinformation efforts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, designed to sow discord in troubled Hong Kong. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which stated clearly they felt Beijing was behind the efforts - Google stopped short, saying only that it had removed material related to protests in Hong Kong.There are also questions for Apple, however. If, as claimed in its statement, Apple knew about the iOS flaw before Google informed them, why did they not properly inform their users? Why, if it knew there were several booby-trapped websites scooping up data on the Uighurs, did it not warn them?And Apple, like Google, won’t say if they think Beijing is directly responsible.

technology	Apple 'sorry' that workers listened to Siri voice recordings		"Apple has apologised following revelations that it paid third-party workers to listen to voice recordings of Siri users.The practice known as ""grading"" has been used by several tech firms as a way of improving the quality of speech recognition.However, Apple, Google and Microsoft all halted such work recently, following public outcry.Apple said it plans to resume grading - but only for Siri users who opt in.The firm added that in the future only its own employees will be able to access recordings, not third-party workers at contracted firms.Earlier this month, the company said it had halted grading following reports that workers had heard recordings containing intimate remarks made by Siri users.Such recordings can be made accidentally, for example when the Siri app interprets another word or noise as the utterance ""Hey Siri"", which is used to launch voice recognition.Now, Apple says it has completed a review of such work.""As a result of our review, we realise we haven't been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologise,"" the firm said in a statement.Up until grading was halted, 0.2% of Siri audio recordings was reviewed by human workers, Apple added.The company said that three main changes would take place before human grading of Siri recordings was resumed. It said:The turnaround was an unusual move from Apple, said Adam Wright, a tech analyst at market research firm IDC.""I think they've been caught off-guard a little bit,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think they've been completely forthcoming or transparent in their use of data.""Part of the controversy over using humans to grade voice recordings was that Siri users may not always have been aware that their conversations could be listened to in this way.The Irish data protection authority, Apple's lead data privacy regulator in Europe, had previously said it was looking into the matter of grading.A spokeswoman for the commission said it had noted Apple's latest statement."
technology	Apple Card can be damaged by wallets and jeans		"Apple has advised owners of its new credit card to keep it away from leather and denim.Keeping the card in a leather wallet or in the pocket of a pair of jeans could cause ""permanent discolouration"".The Apple Card is a relatively plain matt white credit card made of titanium, which was designed to stand out against other credit cards.But people have poked fun at the company after reading that the card could be so easily damaged.Apple has published a guide advising customers how to ""safely store and carry"" their Apple Card.The guide warns that storing the card with other credit cards can scratch and damage it.""I can say from two months of having the card in my leather wallet, it no longer looks pretty,"" said one Apple employee on Twitter.Apple staff were able to sign up for the service before the general public.It is currently available to Apple customers in the US. A launch date for UK customers has not been announced.Apple has previously been criticised for making products that are aesthetically pleasing but easily damaged in everyday use.""When not in use, Apple Card should be returned to a uniformly lit white cube,"" joked Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer.The Apple Card was created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard.It was announced in March as part of Apple's push into services. The company also announced a new television streaming platform, gaming portal and enhanced news app."
technology	Google offers $1.5m 'prize' for spotting Pixel phone bugs	Black market	"Google is raising its ""reward"" for uncovering security flaws in some of its Android smartphones from $200,000 to a maximum of $1.5m.The new top ""prize"" is payable to those who spot bugs in the Titan M security chip in Google's Pixel smartphones, as well as meeting specific criteria.Google said it had paid out more than $4m to security researchers since 2015.But security experts have doubts about whether the reward will deter people from making money from criminals.Other firms, including Apple, Buzzfeed, Facebook and Samsung, also offer rewards for reporting security flaws.Companies run so-called bug bounty schemes to encourage people to report flaws, so that they can be fixed, rather than selling the exploits to criminals.The Titan M security chip in Pixel smartphones is designed to protect the integrity of their operating system and to store biometric data, which is used to unlock the phone.To claim the $1.5m reward, a researcher would have to find a way to compromise that chip on a device running specific developer preview editions of Android.However, one expert suggested the increased bounty was unlikely to change behaviour.""Just like when Apple raised their bug bounty to $1m, Google's move won't compete with the 'black market' [of selling to criminals], which can raise prices any time,"" said Katie Moussouris, chief executive of Luta Security.""This price for external research raises questions for retention and recruitment of internal talent meant to prevent flaws.""The BBC also offers a ""bug bounty"" to security researchers who report problems so that they can be fixed.However, due to the way the broadcaster is funded by the public it offers a ""unique BBC reward"" rather than a cash prize."
technology	Apple Watch bug allowed iPhone eavesdropping	Webcam exposed	"Apple has disabled the Walkie-Talkie app on the Apple Watch, because of a flaw that let users eavesdrop on other people's iPhones.The Walkie-Talkie app let two people who had accepted an invitation send and receive short audio messages.But Apple said it had been ""made aware"" of a flaw that ""could allow somebody to listen through another customer's iPhone without consent"".It has disabled the feature and apologised for the inconvenience.However, Apple said it was not aware of the Walkie-Talkie bug being exploited by anybody in the real world.It said ""specific conditions and sequences of events"" would be required to exploit the bug.Apple found a similar ""eavesdropping"" flaw in its FaceTime video-calling app back in January.In some cases, callers could activate the microphone on a target iPhone even if the recipient did not answer their call.It issued a software update to fix the flaw.In a separate issue, video-conferencing platform Zoom has addressed a flaw that let attackers access webcams without permission.Researcher Jonathan Leitschuh found a bug that let attackers initiate video calls and access a target's webcam.Zoom initially described the issue as low priority.But on Tuesday, it issued an update to address the problem.""We appreciate the hard work of the security researcher in identifying security concerns on our platform,"" it said in a statement."
technology	Apple and Google stop workers playing back voice recordings		"Apple and Google are temporarily stopping workers listening to voice recordings captured by smart speakers and virtual assistants.It follows a Guardian report that third-party contractors used by Apple had heard people having sex and discussing private medical information.Siri and other services can activate in error after wrongly picking up sounds they mishear as their ""wake"" words.Apple said the move would affect users worldwide.Google suspended the practice across the EU on 10 July but has only just confirmed the fact in public.Amazon - which also uses staff to transcribe some recordings - is continuing to do so.Technology companies use staff to ""grade"" voice recordings to improve their virtual assistants' accuracy rates in handling requests - and take steps to anonymise the source.Google, for example, distorts the recording before it is listened to in order to disguise the user's voice.However, many members of the public were unaware of the practice until theBloomberg news agency reported the fact earlier this year.""We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy,” Apple said in a statement.“While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally.""The company added in the future users' voice recordings would not be included in the grading process unless they had chosen to opt in.Germany's data protection commissioner in Hamburg has also launched an investigation into Google over the practice, with which the search company is cooperating.Speech-recognising assistants were ""highly risky"" from a privacy point of view, the regulator said in a press release.""The use of speech assistance systems must be transparent so that informed consent can be obtained from users,"" added the commissioner, Johannes Caspar.Google said it had already stopped transcribing voice recordings and would continue to do so for at least three months.A spokeswoman for the company said Google was ""in touch"" with the Hamburg data protection commissioner.""We don’t associate audio clips with user accounts during the review process, and only perform reviews for around 0.2% of all clips,"" she added.BBC News also asked Amazon whether it plans to suspend speech monitoring.In June, Dave Limp - the executive in charge of Alexa - said only a ""tiny fraction of 1%"" of voice recordings were ever listened to by humans.But he conceded the company's terms and conditions could have been clearer about the matter.The firm has also released a fresh statement.""We already offer customers the ability to opt-out of having their voice recordings used to help develop new Alexa features,"" it said.""The voice recordings from customers who use this opt-out are also excluded from our supervised learning workflows that involve manual review of an extremely small sample of Alexa requests.""We'll also be updating information we provide to customers to make our practices more clear."""
technology	Google reveals fistful of flaws in Apple's iMessage app	Urgent update	"A team of bug-hunters at Google have shared details of five flaws in Apple's iMessage software that could make its devices vulnerable to attack.In one case, the researchers said the vulnerability was so severe that the only way to rescue a targeted iPhone would be to delete all the data off it.Another example, they said, could be used to copy files off a device without requiring the owner to do anything to aid the hack.Apple released fixes last week.But the researchers said they had also flagged a sixth problem to Apple, which had not been rectified in the update to its mobile operating system.""That's quite unusual,"" commented Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at the University of Surrey.""The reputation of the Google Zero team is such that it is worth taking notice of.""The Project Zero team was established in July 2014 to uncover previously undocumented cyber-vulnerabilities. It has previously alerted Microsoft, Facebook and Samsung, among others, to problems with their code.Apple's own notes about iOS 12.4 indicate that the unfixed flaw could give hackers a means to crash an app or execute commands of their own on recent iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches if they were able to discover it.Apple has not commented on this specific issue, but has urged users to install the new version of iOS, which addresses Google's other discoveries as well as a further range of glitches and threats.""Keeping your software up to date is one of the most important things you can do to maintain your Apple product's security,"" it said in a statement.News site ZDnet - which was first to report the matter - noted that the level of detail shared by Google about the other bugs could be enough to let bad actors craft exploits to take advantage of them. Users should download iOS 12.4 ""with no further delay,"" it added.One of the two Google researchers involved - Natalie Silvanovich - intends to share more details of her findings at a presentation at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas next month.The synopsis of her talk also promises it will cover potential vulnerabilities in Apple's Visual Voicemail service - which allows users to select specific recordings - and its Mail app.One of Apple's own security chiefs will also be attending the conference to give a separate presentation, which promises to go ""behind the scenes of iOS and Mac security""."
technology	A brief history of Apple's iTunes	Age of piracyWhat went wrong?The rise of streaming	"Apple has announced iTunes will be absorbed into its three new entertainment apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.It launched a number of new services at a star-studded event in March, signalling a change of direction for the 42-year-old hardware company.ITunes will not be disappearing completely - downloads will still be available in the sidebar of Apple Music, the app will remain and the platform will be unchanged on Windows.""Rumours of iTunes' demise have been over-exaggerated,"" said analyst Ben Wood, from CCS Insight.However, there's little doubt the once iconic music service has had its heyday.""The world has moved on as ubiquitous connectivity, cloud storage, and streaming media became the norm,"" said Jon Porter, at tech news site The Verge.The music store launched in 2003 but iTunes started life in 2001, when the first generation iPod MP3 player - which stored 1,000 tunes - transformed the world of digital music.It wasn't the first on the market but industry experts considered it the most user-friendly and sales soared.Digital music had until then existed in a culture in which pirate sites loomed large and illegal downloading was rife.The file-sharing platform Napster, launched 20 years ago, had opened up an enormous, if illegal, network through which people could freely share music.There was no longer any need to surreptitiously record off the radio on to a cassette - now, millions of tech-savvy music lovers had access to a vast library of tracks, straight from each other's hard drives.But Napster was quickly sued by both music bodies and artists, including Metallica and Dr Dre, who suffered considerable revenue loss.By April 2004, when the iTunes store arrived in the UK, Apple was able to report about 85 million songs had been legally acquired.So confident was the tech giant about the success of its new service that in 2005 it launched the iTunes phone - although it was nowhere near as successful as the iPhone, which followed in 2007.As mobile and broadband capability improved, video, podcasts and e-books became more accessible and iTunes expanded to become much more than a music store.However, it was criticised for growing overly bloated as a result.Dismantling the one-stop-shop into three distinct market stalls could give Apple more of a competitive advantage, said Mark Mulligan, music industry analyst at Midia Research.""Its role as a music app has already diminished... what Apple is doing is saying that to succeed in this world it has to specialise in everything - it can't be a generalist,"" he said.""It's still number two to Spotify - if it's going to be the leading player, which is what it wants to be, it's got to unbundle all of these things and make each one a leader in its space.""The year 2017 was a bumper year for music streaming revenue, with global streaming generating $7.1bn (£5bn) for the music industry - more than CD and vinyl sales.In 2018, 90 billion songs were streamed in the UK alone, according to figures released by music body the BPI - a 33.5% increase from 2017.The public move towards streaming chimes with a broader cultural shift away from ownership and towards subscriptions, rentals and access on-demand.The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) valued the music industry at $17.3bn (£12.4bn) in 2017, marking its third year of growth after years of decline dogged by struggles with piracy and declining physical sales.But even a revamped offering from Apple, with its huge global fan base of loyal customers, is unlikely to boost it back to its glory days, according to Mark Mulligan.""Realistically, music is never going to get back to that place again,"" he said.""There are so many things competing for people's spend and attention.""Now, streaming video and games matters just as much. Music isn't as essential anymore."""
technology	Apple dissolves iTunes into new apps	PrivacyiOS 13Apple WatchMac Pro	"Apple has announced that iTunes is to be replaced by Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.There had been speculation that the tech giant was planning to shutter the music service it launched in 2001.The firm also revealed a number of new privacy measures at its annual developer conference in San Jose.A new sign-in will be an alternative to logging into apps using social media accounts, hiding the user's email address and data.iTunes will remain unchanged on Windows platforms, and downloads will still be available in a sidebar on the Apple Music app for Macs.The announcements were made at the WWDC conference, where the tech giant outlines its software plans for the months ahead.Apple announced several new privacy measures, building on last year's event where it pledged to jam Facebook's tracking tools.""Privacy is a fundamental human right,"" said Apple's software chief Craig Federighi.He said that there will be an option for apps which request location information to have to ask every time they require it, and they will be blocked from using other markers, such as identifying Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals.Apple is also launching a sign-in-with-Apple login, as an alternative to logging in to a service using a social media account.Using this login, users can choose to hide their email address, with Apple creating a random alternative address which will forward to the real mailbox.""The unveiling of 'Sign-in With Apple' will concern rivals, particularly the web giants,"" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight.""Existing sign-in services provide a simple means for single sign-in across the web. Privacy is the differentiator that will be heavily emphasised versus Facebook and Google, and represents a great marketing tool for Apple's broader privacy stance.""The next iteration of the iPhone's operating system - iOS 13 - includes a range of changes to its interface, as well as new functions.The new Dark Mode enables iPhone apps to be viewed with a black background, while the Apple Maps app will come with a virtual tour experience similar to Google's Street View.Other key features include the option to silence unknown callers and block senders within the Mail app, improved search in messages, and optimised battery charging.Apple has also made improvements to its language keyboards, including the introduction of new bilingual keyboards and typing predictions for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Cantonese, Vietnamese and the 22 official Indian languages.What a MAJOR moment! So honored to be chosen to work with @apple to showcase the new iOS 13 MEMOJI updates for #WWDC key note!

technology	Google and Apple criticise GCHQ eavesdropping idea	Silent copy	"A ""hypothetical"" proposal by UK security agency GCHQ to eavesdrop on encrypted messages has been criticised by tech firms and rights groups.Google and Apple were among 47 firms to sign an open letter, saying it was a ""serious threat"" to trust and security.The GCHQ plan would mean, in some circumstances, security services got copies of encrypted messages.The technique resembled the way that GCHQ currently used wiretaps to listen to unencrypted chat, said the agency.The plan for a so-called ""ghost protocol"" was first floated by the UK National Cyber Security Centre's technical director Ian Levy and GCHQ's chief codebreaker Crispin Robinson in November 2018.The proposal was intended to add to the debate about strongly encrypted messaging systems that security services have struggled to break.Instead of asking for encryption systems to be weakened so they can be cracked, the plan would instead copy messages and send the duplicate on to a third recipient.That other recipient would be able to read the message because they possessed a key corresponding to the one with which it was encrypted.The ghosting system would only be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" to gather information about suspects, said the discussion paper about the technology.In their letter, rights groups, industry bodies and tech firms said the idea would ""violate"" important human rights principles.Signatories include Google, Apple, WhatsApp and Microsoft as well as Big Brother Watch, Privacy International and the Center for Democracy and Technology.The letter said that implementing GCHQ's idea would require changes that ""undermine user security and trust"" and potentially introduce vulnerabilities into messaging systems.""The overwhelming majority of users rely on their confidence in reputable providers to perform authentication functions and verify that the participants in a conversation are the people they think they are, and only those people,"" said the letter.""GCHQ's ghost proposal completely undermines this trust relationship and the authentication process,"" it added.It would also threaten privacy and free speech, wrote the signatories.In response, Mr Levy said its idea was ""hypothetical"" and intended as a ""starting point for discussion"".He added: ""We will continue to engage with interested parties and look forward to having an open discussion to reach the best solutions possible."""
technology	Apple faces customer lawsuit over app store		"A group of US consumers has been given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court to sue Apple over app prices.The iPhone users argued that there is no alternative place to buy an iPhone app, but that Apple takes a 30% commission on every sale, so therefore they are being overcharged.They claim that this puts Apple in breach of anti-trust laws.Apple said that it was an agent for app developers and that it neither owned nor sold the apps itself.However, while app developers set their own prices, Apple collects the payments.One of the judges who ruled against Apple was President Donald Trump's controversial appointment, Brett Kavanaugh.""Leaving consumers at the mercy of monopolistic retailers, simply because upstream suppliers could also sue the retailers, would directly contradict the long-standing goal of effective private enforcement in anti-trust cases,"" he said.The suit, filed by leading plaintiff Robert Pepper, dates back to 2011.According to statistics portal Statista, US customers spent $46.6bn (£36bn) on a combination of in-app purchases, subscription and premium apps in 2018."
technology	Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon face US anti-trust probe	Investigations	"The US government is to take a fresh look at how the four tech giants Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon wield their power.It comes in the wake of criticism about privacy breaches, disinformation and anti-competitive practices.It could lead to more formal investigations from the Federal Trade Commission, among others.Shares in all four fell on the news but none has yet commented.At a news conference, Democratic congressman David Cicilline, who is chairman of the House Judiciary's sub-committee, said it plans a number of hearings and will take testimony from executives of leading technology firms.There could also be requests for politicians to view internal documents.He said the investigation would not target one specific company but rather focus on the belief that ""the internet is broken"".US President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of Google and social media firms, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices. He has also criticised Amazon for taking advantage of the US Postal Service.The FTC is already investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal with the social network bracing itself for fines of up to $5bn (£3.9bn).Google has also been scrutinised by the FTC and was fined 1.5bn euros (£1.3bn) in March for abusing its dominant position in online search advertising.Apple is also the subject of an EU investigation following a complaint from streaming music provider Spotify that it abuses its power over app downloads."
technology	Apple defends removing parental control apps		"Apple has defended its decision to remove a number of parental control apps from the App Store, citing security concerns.Several app-makers complained to the New York Times that Apple had taken their products off sale when it launched its own similar tools.But Apple said the apps were removed because they ""put users' privacy and security at risk"".It said the apps had been given time to make changes to meet Apple's rules.The latest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system added Screen Time tools, which let people see how much time they spend using their favourite apps.The tools also let parents control how much time their children can spend on apps and websites.Some app-makers claimed Apple had removed their products from the App Store after Screen Time was launched, and said it was trying to limit competition.However, in a blog post, Apple said it had taken action against apps that were using ""risky"" Mobile Device Management (MDM) to control children's smartphones.Many corporations and organisations use MDM to control what employees do on their phones. It lets businesses keep an eye on what staff are doing, and even wipe their phones remotely.Apple said it was not appropriate for family-focused time management tools to use MDM.""MDM gives a third party control and access over a device and its most sensitive information, including user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions, and browsing history,"" Apple said in a blog.""It is incredibly risky - and a clear violation of App Store policies - for a private, consumer-focused app business to install MDM control over a customer's device.""Contrary to what The New York Times reported over the weekend, this isn't a matter of competition. It's a matter of security.""The company said it had given a number of affected apps 30 days to submit updated software that did not break its rules. It said many of the companies did make changes and were not removed."
technology	Apple to warn iPhone users about update impact		"Apple has pledged to warn iPhone owners if an update is likely to significantly slow a device or affect battery life.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK had expressed concerns in 2017 that people had not realised an operating system update could affect the performance of the phone.It feared that iPhone owners had been repairing their devices or replacing the batteries unnecessarily.It can now take court action if Apple does not comply.The CMA added that by signing up to this commitment to greater transparency, Apple was bound by it.""To ensure compliance with consumer law, Apple has formally agreed to improve the information it provides to people about the battery health of their phones and the impact performance management software may have on their phones,"" the CMA says on its website.Apple believes that changes to the way it allows users to monitor their battery's performance among other improvements it has made mean that it is already in accordance with the CMA's wishes.A spokesman declined to provide further comment."
technology	Instagram 'stalker' app Ghosty drops off Google Play Store		"The maker of Ghosty, an app which gives users access to private profiles, has removed it from Google's Play Store.The move came after Instagram said it planned to send a cease and desist letter to Ghosty's developer.The service required each user to give it access to their own profile, as well as to invite their friends - at least one of whom also had to join.It then gives access to data in those accounts as well as any other profiles which those users follow.If a member has access to a private profile, when they join it also becomes available to the rest of Ghosty's users. This would include otherwise inaccessible videos and photos.The app, which charged a subscription fee, had been downloaded more than 500,000 times since its launch in April, according to analytics firm App Brain.Android Police, which reported on the controversy last week, had described it as creating ""a stalker paradise"".Instagram's terms of use state that users cannot transfer ""any aspect"" of their account to others.'Yes, this app violates our terms,"" a spokeswoman for the Facebook-owned platform told the BBC.""This functionality has never been available through our API [application programming interface].""We will be sending a cease and desist letter to Ghosty ordering them to immediately stop their activities on Instagram, among other requests. We are investigating and planning further enforcement relating to this developer.""Ghosty's developer did not reply to the BBC's request for comment.Its deletion comes a week after Apple removed Like Patrol from its own online store - another app that Instagram had objected to scraping its data."
technology	Apple abandons AirPower wireless charging product		"In a highly unusual step for the firm, Apple has given up on a product because it could not make it work adequately.AirPower, announced in 2017, was a mat meant to charge multiple devices without needing to plug them in.But it is understood the firm’s engineers were perhaps unable to stop the mat from getting too hot.""After much effort, we’ve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project,"" the firm said.The company did not elaborate further.However, rumours of issues with the product had been circulating since its announcement in September 2017. At the time, Apple said it would be released to the public some time in 2018, promising a ""world-class wireless charging solution"".But late last year, with the product absent from the most recent iPhone launch, noted Apple insider Jon Gruber wrote: ""There are engineers who looked at AirPower’s design and said it could never work, thermally, and now those same engineers have that 'told you so' smug look on their faces.""In a statement emailed to the BBC, Dan Riccio, Apple’s head of hardware engineering, said: ""We apologise to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.""The cancelled product could affect sales of the company’s wireless headphones - AirPods - which were promoted and sold with the promise they would be charged using AirPower in future. Packaging for the AirPods contained a diagram of how AirPower would work.Apple’s rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Apple and Qualcomm square off in US court	Courting costs	"Apple and Qualcomm will face off in court as a billion-dollar legal battle over smartphone chips gets under way.The trial is the culmination of a long-running battle between the two over the cost of the processors that phones use to connect to mobile networks.Apple claims Qualcomm is charging too much and that its control of the technology stifles innovation.Qualcomm disagrees, saying that because it invented the chips it should be rewarded appropriately.The row between the pair began in 2017 when Apple first filed a legal complaint. It believes that Qualcomm's dominance in phone technology lets it get away with charging high fees.Foxconn and Pegatron, which assemble phones for Apple, have signed up to back the legal action.Qualcomm has an extensive patent portfolio covering many of the technologies used in smartphones and derives a significant amount of its annual revenue through licence payments from phone makers.It argues that its technology covers more than just these basic chips, called modems, and that is why it asks electronics firms to pay the fees.Qualcomm has also accused Apple of using the legal system as a way to pay less for its technologies.The trial is expected to last five weeks. Its opening sessions will select the jury to oversee the trial and let lawyers representing each side give opening arguments. Apple boss Tim Cook and senior Qualcomm staff are expected to testify.Billions of dollars are at stake in the trial. Apple wants to claw back billions it claims it has overpaid. Qualcomm wants damages to punish Apple for breaching the contract it signed with the chip inventor.If Qualcomm loses, the decision could have a significant impact on the way it operates, because other phone makers are likely to challenge the fees they pay.The legal action between the two has kicked off investigations in many other regions and nations.This has led to Qualcomm paying fines in China ($975m, £744m), South Korea ($853m) and Taiwan ($93m).In early 2018. the European Commission levied a fine of €997m (£860m) against Qualcomm for allegedly breaking anti-trust laws. Qualcomm has appealed against the fine saying the case against it was ""flawed"".Apple has also been hit by the fall out from the legal battle. Temporary injunctions halting the sale of iPhone 7 and 8 models were granted in Germany and China.In March this year, a US court ruled that Apple had infringed on three Qualcomm patents covering ways to improve battery life."
technology	Apple recalls plugs in UK, Hong Kong and Singapore		"Apple has asked customers to stop using certain plug adapters because of a risk of electric shock.It has issued a recall of two types of plug; the AC wall plug adapter shipped with Macs and some iOS devices between 2003 and 2010, and a three-pronged plug included in the World Travel Adapter kit.The affected plugs were shipped in the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong.Six incidents have been reported, Apple said.In a statement, the firm said: ""In very rare cases, affected Apple three-prong wall plug adapters designed primarily for use in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong may break and create a risk of electrical shock if exposed metal parts are touched.""Customer safety is always Apple's top priority and we have voluntarily decided to exchange affected wall plug adapters with a new adapter, free of charge.""It did not clarify how many people had received electric shocks.Affected plugs are white, with no letters on the inside slot, unlike newer versions which are white with grey on the inside and have a dimple on the side to make them easier to unplug.Apple USB power adapters are not affected.The iPhone maker is in the middle of another plug recall, which affected two-pronged adapters for use in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Argentina and Brazil. These plugs had the same issue."
technology	Apple AI accused of leading to man's wrongful arrest		"A student is suing Apple Inc for $1bn (£0.77bn), claiming that its in-store AI led to his mistaken arrest.Ousmane Bah, 18, said he was accused of stealing from Apple Stores in four US states, and arrested at his home in New York last autumn.He believes Apple's algorithms linked video footage of the thief with his name, leading to the charges.Apple has told the BBC that it does not use facial recognition technology in its stores.Mr Bah claims that a detective reviewed security footage from the time of one of the crimes and found the thief looked ""nothing like"" him.Mr Bah had previously lost his provisional driving licence, which he believes may have been used by the thief during the robberies. The licence is not meant to be used for identification purposes, and does not include a photograph.Mr Bah believes that Apple's algorithms are now trained to connect his name to images of the thief.A detective with the New York Police Department allegedly told Mr Bah that the thief probably used Mr Bah's driving licence as identification during one of the robberies. The detective reportedly said that this may have caused Mr Bah to be charged with thefts committed at Apple Stores in New York, Delaware, New Jersey and Massachusetts, according to court papers.Mr Bah said one of the charges was for the theft of Apple pencils from a store in Boston - a city he had never visited. On the date of the robbery, he says he was attending his senior prom in New York.Mr Bah claims that travelling to different states to respond to charges filed against him has affected his college attendance, and his grades have suffered as a result.Apple's Face ID technology caused a stir when it was launched on the iPhone X in 2017, with commentators concerned that users' biometric data could be hacked if they used the feature. As far as is known, this is the first case against Apple that claims its facial recognition technology has been used to identify customers who have visited its stores."
technology	Slave markets found on Instagram and other apps	Slave marketHuman rights violatedSponsor's permission'Real hell'Hashtag removed	"Drive around the streets of Kuwait and you won't see these women. They are behind closed doors, deprived of their basic rights, unable to leave and at risk of being sold to the highest bidder.But pick up a smartphone and you can scroll through thousands of their pictures, categorised by race, and available to buy for a few thousand dollars.An undercover investigation by BBC News Arabic has found that domestic workers are being illegally bought and sold online in a booming black market.Some of the trade has been carried out on Facebook-owned Instagram, where posts have been promoted via algorithm-boosted hashtags, and sales negotiated via private messages.Other listings have been promoted in apps approved and provided by Google Play and Apple's App Store, as well as the e-commerce platforms' own websites.""What they are doing is promoting an online slave market,"" said Urmila Bhoola, the UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery.""If Google, Apple, Facebook or any other companies are hosting apps like these, they have to be held accountable.""After being alerted to the issue, Facebook said it had banned one of the hashtags involved.Google and Apple said they were working with app developers to prevent illegal activity.The illegal sales are a clear breach of the US tech firms' rules for app developers and users.However, the BBC has found there are many related listings still active on Instagram, and other apps available via Apple and Google.Nine out of 10 Kuwaiti homes have a domestic worker - they come from some of the poorest parts of the world to the Gulf, aiming to make enough money to support their family at home.Posing as a couple newly arrived in Kuwait, the BBC Arabic undercover team spoke to 57 app users and visited more than a dozen people who were trying to sell them their domestic worker via a popular commodity app called 4Sale.The sellers almost all advocated confiscating the women's passports, confining them to the house, denying them any time off and giving them little or no access to a phone.The 4Sale app allowed you to filter by race, with different price brackets clearly on offer, according to category.""African worker, clean and smiley,"" said one listing. Another: ""Nepalese who dares to ask for a day off.""When speaking to the sellers, the undercover team frequently heard racist language. ""Indians are the dirtiest,"" said one, describing a woman being advertised.The team were urged by app users, who acted as if they were the ""owners"" of these women, to deny them other basic human rights, such as giving them a ""day or a minute or a second"" off.One man, a policeman, looking to offload his worker said: ""Trust me she's very nice, she laughs and has a smiley face. Even if you keep her up till 5am she won't complain.""He told the BBC team how domestic workers were used as a commodity.""You will find someone buying a maid for 600 KD ($2,000), and selling her on for 1,000 KD ($3,300),"" he said.He suggested how the BBC team should treat her: ""The passport, don't give it to her. You're her sponsor. Why would you give her her passport?""In one case, the BBC team was offered a 16-year-old girl. It has called her Fatou to protect her real name.Fatou had been trafficked from Guinea in West Africa and had been employed as a domestic worker in Kuwait for six months, when the BBC discovered her. Kuwait's laws say that domestic workers must be over 21.Her seller's sales pitch included the facts that she had given Fatou no time off, her passport and phone had been taken away, and she had not allowed her to leave the house alone - all of which are illegal in Kuwait.""This is the quintessential example of modern slavery,"" said Ms Bhoola. ""Here we see a child being sold and traded like chattel, like a piece of property.""In most places in the Gulf, domestic workers are brought into the country by agencies and then officially registered with the government.Potential employers pay the agencies a fee and become the official sponsor of the domestic worker.Under what is known as the Kafala system, a domestic worker cannot change or quit her job, nor leave the country without her sponsor's permission.In 2015, Kuwait introduced some of the most wide-ranging laws to help protect domestic workers. But the law was not popular with everyone.Apps including 4Sale and Instagram enable employers to sell the sponsorship of their domestic workers to other employers, for a profit. This bypasses the agencies, and creates an unregulated black market which leaves women more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.This online slave market is not just happening in Kuwait.In Saudi Arabia, the investigation found hundreds of women being sold on Haraj, another popular commodity app. There were hundreds more on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.The BBC team travelled to Guinea to try to contact the family of Fatou, the child they had discovered being offered for sale in Kuwait.Every year hundreds of women are trafficked from here to the Gulf as domestic workers.""Kuwait is really a hell,"" said one former maid, who recalled being made to sleep in the same place as cows by the woman who employed her. ""Kuwaiti houses are very bad,"" said another. ""No sleep, no food, nothing.""Fatou was found by the Kuwaiti authorities and taken to the government-run shelter for domestic workers. Two days later she was deported back to Guinea for being a minor.She told the BBC about her experience working in three households during her nine months in Kuwait: ""They used to shout at me and call me an animal. It hurt, it made me sad, but there was nothing I could do.""Now she is back at school in Conakry, where the BBC visited her.""I am so happy,"" she said.""Even now, talking about it, I'm still happy. My life is better now. I feel like I'm coming back from slavery.""The Kuwaiti government says it is ""at war with this kind of behaviour"" and insisted the apps would be ""heavily scrutinised"".To date, no significant action has been taken against the platforms. And there has not been any legal action against the woman who tried to sell Fatou. The seller has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.Since the BBC team contacted the apps and tech companies about their findings, 4Sale has removed the domestic worker section of its platform.Facebook said it had banned the Arabic hashtag ""خادمات للتنازل#"" - which translates as ""#maidsfortransfer"".""We will continue to work with law enforcement, expert organisations and industry to prevent this behaviour on our platforms,"" added a Facebook spokesman.There was no comment from the Saudi commodity app, Haraj.Google said it was ""deeply troubled by the allegations"".""We have asked BBC to share additional details so we can conduct a more in-depth investigation,"" it added. ""We are working to ensure that the app developers put in place the necessary safeguards to prevent individuals from conducting this activity on their online marketplaces.""Apple said it ""strictly prohibited"" the promotion of human trafficking and child exploitation in apps made available on its marketplace.""App developers are responsible for policing the user-generated content on their platforms,"" it said.""We work with developers to take immediate corrective actions whenever we find any issues and, in extreme cases, we will remove the app from the Store.""We also work with developers to report any illegalities to local law enforcement authorities.""The firms continue to distribute the 4Sale and Haraj apps, however, on the basis that their primary purpose is to sell legitimate goods and services.4Sale may have tackled the problem, but at the time of publication, hundreds of domestic workers were still being traded on Haraj, Instagram and other apps which the BBC has seen."
technology	Apple to investigate Saudi app		"A Saudi Arabian app that can be used to track women and prevent them from travelling will be investigated by Apple, its chief executive has said.In an interview with NPR, Tim Cook said he wasn't aware of the Absher app but would look into it.The app, which offers access to government services, has been criticised by human rights groups.Democratic senator Ron Wyden has called for Apple and Google to remove it from their stores.Women in Saudi Arabia need to get permission to leave the country from a male guardian, usually a father or husband.The Absher app, which is designed for a range of government services, such as renewing driving licences, makes the process of allowing or prohibiting travel a lot easier, and it can be done via a smartphone.Originally designed for the Ministry of Interior, the app has been in use for several years and downloaded more than a million times.An investigation from website Insider exposed how it was being used by male guardians to register wives, sisters and daughters to either restrict or permit international travel.The man receives a notification if a dependent woman attempts to leave the country.Human Rights Watch told the publication: ""Apps like this one can facilitate human rights abuses, including discrimination against women.""In an open letter to both companies, in response to the report, Mr Wyden wrote: ""It is hardly news that the Saudi monarchy seeks to restrict and repress Saudi women but American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government's patriarchy.""The app has also been used by some women to secretly change the settings on their male guardian's phone so that it allows them to travel, the Insider reports.Google has not responded to requests from the BBC for comment."

technology	Apple unveils TV streaming platform and credit card	Apple TVApple CardNews standGaming	"Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California.Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant.The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO.Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app.The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices.It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company.There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix.The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn.Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said.Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street.The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku.The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle.""The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?"" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York.The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer.There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase.The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey.It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard.The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone.The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said.It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so.Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (£7.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year.Unlike TV+, the news platform will only be available on Apple devices.A new games platform, Apple Arcade, will offer over 100 exclusive games from the app store which will all be playable offline, in contrast with Google's recently announced streaming platform Stadia.It will be rolled out across 150 countries in the autumn but no subscription prices were given.in 2018 analyst firm IHS Markit valued the global gaming market on iOS, Apple's operating system, at $33.5bn.There is space within that market for a platform like Apple Arcade which is not financed by in-app purchases or advertising, said IHS director of games research Piers Harding-Rolls.""Apple's decision to move up the games value chain with a new, curated subscription service and to support the development of exclusive games for its Arcade platform is a significant escalation of the company's commitment to the games market,"" he said.""Apple joins the other technology companies Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and others in investing directly in games content and services.""Apple is making an aggressive push into several markets in which, thanks to sheer scale alone, it immediately becomes a massive player.Its TV service has been long in the making, and Apple has amassed a roster of big stars, as expected.A bigger test will be how creative those ideas will be - a lot of Netflix's success has been about finding new talent, not throwing money at already famous names.I also have reservations about how many boundaries Apple will be prepared to push with its creative endeavours: if it's as controlling with its television as it is with its brand, it will create a catalogue bereft of risk-taking.But TV is just a small part of what Apple is going for here. It wants (and needs) to turn its devices into the portal through which you do everything else - TV/film, gaming, reading the news... and you'd presume other things in the very near future.The announcement of a credit card shows how far Apple is prepared to go to make sure life is experienced through your iPhone.As Oprah put it on stage: ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all."""
technology	Game of Thrones: Now TV glitch hits Apple TV owners		"Sky has apologised to Game of Thrones fans after it had problems streaming the show via its Now TV app on Apple TV set-top boxes.The issue coincided with the highly anticipated premiere of season eight of the fantasy series on the firm's UK internet service.Some users were unable to log in at all while others were shown poor quality video with smeared colours and green digital artefacts spoiling the image.Other overseas apps also had glitches.A spokesman for Sky said that only a minority of its overall Now TV user-base had been affected over the course of Monday evening but was unable to provide a detailed explanation for the fault.""We know how big an event Game of Thrones is and we're sorry some fans had problems watching it on Apple TV,"" he added.""We fixed it as quickly as possible and have put in place extra measures to make sure it doesn't happen again.""The programme had been available for most of Monday daytime after going live on the service at 03:00 BST.While the problem was ongoing, Now TV's social media team had suggested that users try streaming the show via a different device such as a PlayStation, Xbox or native Smart TV app.But annoyed viewers pointed out that since they had purchased their Now TV subscription via their Apple TV's iTunes account, they were blocked from streaming it to their television by other means.However, Sky does in fact offer a way to extend accounts to other products via an online registration process.While Sky's problems were limited to Apple's platform, there were reports of problems elsewhere.HBO - the US network that makes Game of Thrones - acknowledged in a tweet that some Latin America-based members of its Go service were having problems. Some had seen the service fail mid-episode.Users who had purchased access to HBO via the US-based Hulu app were also mistakenly shown messages saying that the programme was ""currently unavailable"" or that their subscription did not include the series.In both cases, the issues appear to have been solved.Members of another US-based service, AT&T's DirectTV Now, had a more pleasant surprise when the streaming platform briefly made the episode available several hours before it was supposed to go live.""When we became aware of the error, we immediately fixed it,"" said the firm in a statement.Despite the variety of legal ways to watch Game of Thrones, many people have turned to pirated copies of the show.According to the news site Torrentfreak, more than 120,000 people were actively sharing three torrented copies sourced from an Amazon download on Monday shortly after it had become available."
technology	Apple responds to Spotify complaints over App store	Store rules	"Apple has replied to claims by Spotify that App store policies gave it an ""unfair advantage"".Spotify made its comments as it filed an official anti-trust complaint against Apple in Europe saying it ""limited"" consumer choice.Apple took the unusual step of replying via a public statement clarifying how the App store worked and the fees it charged.""Spotify wants all the benefits of a free app without being free,"" it said.In a blog Daniel Ek, co-founder of the music-streaming service, said it had decided to file its anti-trust complaint because Apple had changed App store policies to ""purposely limit choice and stifle innovation"".In addition, the fees Apple charged for making purchases via the App store were, in effect, a ""tax"", said Mr Ek. He added that Spotify would have to raise the price of a premium membership for its streaming service if it paid these fees.However, said Mr Ek, firms that did not pay the fees were subject to ""technical"" limits that could stop them talking to customers.Mr Ek said it had tried to talk to Apple about these issues but the negotiations had come to nothing.Apple hit back saying the App store let innovation thrive because all developers know that ""everyone is playing by the same set of rules"".It also said it had not hampered Spotify's ability to update its app unless the music service sought to ""sidestep"" the rules other apps follow.Spotify's claims about fees also got a rebuttal from Apple. It said that 84% of apps in the store pay nothing to Apple when they were downloaded or used.There were also many situations, such as with free apps or ad-driven apps, that meant developers gave no cash to Apple, it said.The fees Spotify criticised were levied when programs used Apple's own in-app secure purchasing system, it said. Fees halved after 12 months, it added.Apple said Spotify wanted all the benefits bestowed by its presence in the App store without sharing some of the money it made from that exposure.""We think that's wrong,"" it said.Writing on the Verge news site, Sam Byford said Apple had only addressed some of Spotify's criticisms. Questions remained about when fees were levied and on what types of goods, he said.""This week's PR blitz from both Spotify and Apple has been unprecedented, and it's unlikely that today's statement will settle the matter,"" he said."

""To be clear, this didn't have an impact on our consumer-facing services.""Apple allows companies the ability to exert special control over employee devices in order to add additional security and control.Many firms use this to distribute apps that might contain private information to employees but not the wider public.EscalationSome firms also distribute test or beta versions of apps the firm is working on such as, in Google’s case, Maps, Hangouts and Gmail.Both firms use internal iOS apps to help employees access services such as travel.However, Apple explicitly prohibits firms from using this access on regular consumers.On Monday it was revealed that Facebook had used its enterprise access to distribute a market research app to the public, including teenagers.On Tuesday it became known that Google was doing something similar with its own app, Screenwise.Apple appears to have stood firm on its position that ""any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked”.While Google has its own operating system, Android, a large number of the company’s almost 100,000 employees use iPhones for their work, and the firm releases much of its software on both Android and Apple’s iOS.The row has been seen as a major escalation between Apple and its major rivals over protecting user data.________Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

It said it had removed further content across Facebook and Instagram, and would prevent the creation of new accounts designed to be used for the online slave market.Many of the most widely used accounts for buying and selling domestic workers appear to have stopped their activity.Dr Mubarak Al-Azimi, head of Kuwait's Public Authority for Manpower, said it was investigating the woman featured in the BBC report who sold a 16-year-old girl from Guinea - whom we are calling ""Fatou"" - via an app.A police officer who also featured in the report is under investigation by the authorities.He said arrests and compensation for the victims were possible outcomes of the action.Kimberley Motley, an American international lawyer who has taken on Fatou's case, said: ""I believe the app developers should definitely provide compensation for Fatou. As well as possibly Apple and Google.""On Apple Store they proclaim that they are responsible for everything that's put on their store. And so our question is, what does that responsibility mean?""Ms Motley also called for criminal charges against those involved in trafficking Fatou to Kuwait.Google and Apple said they were working with app developers to prevent illegal activity on their platforms.On Thursday, BBC News Arabic published its undercover investigation which found domestic workers were being illegally bought and sold online in a booming black market."

It was also found to hit Mac users who were called from an iPhone.The flaw meant the microphone on a recipient's smartphone was activated, even if the call to them was not accepted.New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued a warning about the flaw and urged people to disable FaceTime until it was fixed.The New York authorities are now looking into whether Apple did enough to warn people about the problem."
technology	Apple rushes to fix FaceTime 'eavesdropping' bug	'National Privacy Day'	"Apple has acknowledged a flaw in its FaceTime software that allowed for brief eavesdropping - even if the recipient did not pick up.In some cases the target iPhone could send video without the receiver's knowledge.The company said it had developed a fix and an update would be rolled out this week.In the meantime, Apple's status page shows it has disabled the ability for users to make group calls on FaceTime.The flaw, first revealed by the 9to5Mac blog, appears to occur when both users are running version 12.1 of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, or newer. It also affects Mac users when they are called from an iPhone.The technique involves using the software's group chat function, apparently confusing the software into activating the target's microphone, even if the call has not been accepted.The eavesdropping ends when the call is cut after too many rings.In addition to audio, 9to5Mac reported that pressing buttons to block the call or turn off the device would result in video being sent to the call-maker, without the recipient's knowledge.In a statement, Apple told journalists: “We’re aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.”On social media, concerned users - including Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey - suggested disabling the FaceTime function altogether, which can be done via the device's settings menu.Discovery of the flaw coincided with National Privacy Day in the US, a day heralded by Apple boss Tim Cook.“On this #DataPrivacyDay let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections,” he wrote on Twitter.“The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.”New York governor Andrew Cuomo advised his state's residents ""to disable their FaceTime app until a fix is made available"",He said: ""The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk.""In New York, we take consumer rights very seriously and I am deeply concerned by this irresponsible bug that can be exploited for unscrupulous purposes.""Apple also recently made a big play of its privacy credentials at the recent CES tech expo in Las Vegas.The company did not attend but placed a billboard near the event, reading: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.""The timing of the revelations about the bug is awkward for Apple, which is due to announce its latest earning report on Tuesday.

technology	Amazon, Apple and Google face data complaints	What's the problem?What did they find?Complaints filed	"Entertainment streaming giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify have been accused of breaking the EU's data regulations.General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules say EU customers have the right to access a copy of the personal data companies hold about them.However, privacy group noyb said it found that most of the big streaming companies did not fully comply.It has filed formal complaints, which if upheld could result in large fines.GDPR took effect in May 2018 and gives EU customers the right to demand a copy of their personal data from companies. That data must be easy to understand and should also be presented in a machine-readable format, so that a customer could transfer all their data to a competitor, for example.When GDPR took effect, many of the biggest names in tech including Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify made changes, to let customers download a copy of their data.But the privacy campaign group noyb, whose slogan is ""My Privacy is none of your Business"", said it found many of the biggest services did not do enough to comply with the law.Individuals working with noyb requested a copy of their data from several movie and music streaming services.They found Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Google's YouTube all let people download a copy of their personal information quickly. But noyb said that only some of the data was ""intelligible"", with some parts supplied in a format that could not be understood by people.The GDPR requires the data to be both machine-readable and easily understood by customers.All four streaming giants also failed to supply additional information to which people are entitled, such as a list of other companies with whom their data was shared.Netflix supplied the requested data in a format that was easy to understand, but did not supply all the additional information and took about 30 days to reply.Soundcloud and UK-based streaming service Dazn did not reply to the information requests at all.Privacy activist Max Schrems, diector of noyb, said: ""In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data was shared with.""This leads to structural violations of users' rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information.""Noyb said it had filed 10 complaints with Austria's data protection regulator.The maximum penalty for a breach of the GDPR is 20 million euros (£17.7m) or 4% of a company's global turnover.In theory, Apple could be fined £7bn if the regulatory authority rules that it has broken the law.The BBC has contacted the named companies for comment.Spotify said in a statement: ""Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant."""
technology	Apple to pay teenager who found FaceTime bug	Cash callNo details	"A US teenager who discovered a security flaw in Apple's FaceTime video-calling system has been given a bug bounty.Apple has not revealed the exact amount it is giving 14-year-old Grant Thompson but it is believed to include money to help pay for his education.The teenager found a bug that meant he could briefly eavesdrop on recipients to a group FaceTime call.The reward comes as one security researcher refused to tell Apple about a bug because no bounty was on offer.Information about the bug first emerged in late January and revealed that some Apple users could secretly listen to people they called via FaceTime even if the recipient did not accept the call.Apple deemed it so serious that it disabled the group FaceTime feature while it investigated and produced a fix.News reports about the problem initially said it was just being discussed on social media and did not credit any individual with its discovery.Later, it emerged that Apple had been warned about it earlier in January by Grant and his mother. The teenager uncovered the problem when using FaceTime to talk about strategies for the Fortnite game with friends.Mrs Thompson sent several emails and other messages to Apple warning about the vulnerability but initially got no response.Now, Apple has credited Grant, who's from Catalina, in Arizona, with finding the flaw. News about his reward came on the day that Apple issued a software update that fixed the bug.Apple's bug bounty policy has led one security researcher to withhold details on a password-stealing vulnerability in the MacOS operating system.German bug hunter Linus Henze said he would not release details of the problem to Apple until it included MacOS in its bounty programme. Currently Apple only pays for bugs found in the iOS operating system for phones. In addition, security experts have to be invited to take part in the programme that pays up to $200,000 (£154,300) for the most serious bugs.""My motivation is to get Apple to create a bug bounty program. I think that this is the best for both Apple and researchers,"" he told tech news site the Register."
technology	Huawei launches foldable Mate X in China	Accidental damage?	"Huawei's foldable smartphone, the Mate X, has, briefly, gone on sale in China.The handset went on sale for a price of 16,999 yuan (£1,900) via Huawei's online store and reportedly sold out out ""within minutes"".Phone fans who did not manage to buy a Mate X on Friday will get another chance on 22 November when a second batch will go on sale.Anyone buying one of the folding devices also gets 50% off screen-related repairs and replacements.The 5G Mate X is available in one model featuring an 8in (20.3cm) screen when unfolded. When closed it has two screens - one 6.8in and the smaller one 6.6in.Huawei said the phone was available in ""limited quantities"" for the first sale but did not give a precise number on how many were sold.Growing numbers of phone-makers are starting to offer foldable devices. Samsung, Xiaomi and Motorola have both made flexible devices alongside smaller players such as Royole. Other phone-makers, including Apple and Google, are known to be experimenting with their own designs.The Huawei device was initially due to go on sale in June but the launch was delayed following the imposition of sanctions by the US.The phone is currently available only in China but Huawei has said it will be available in other countries at some point.Ben Wood, from analyst CCS Insight, said he was ""increasingly sceptical"" about Huawei's folding phone after using the Samsung Galaxy Fold for a few weeks and spending some time with the just-released Motorola Razr.Huawei's decision to put the screen on the outside of the phone made it ""incredibly vulnerable"" to accidental damage, he said.""That risk, the eye-watering price and the decision to only ship it in China makes me wonder whether it is a super niche device that was more about Huawei demonstrating 'the art of the possible' rather than having a credible commercial product,"" he told the BBC."
technology	Apple FaceTime car crash lawsuit dismissed	"Severe damageNo ""duty of care"""	"A lawsuit blaming Apple for a child's death in a car crash, has been dismissed by a US appeals court in California.Garrett Wilhelm told police he was using FaceTime on the iPhone 6 when he crashed into the back of a family car.Five-year-old Moriah Modisette died from the injuries she sustained in the 2014 Christmas Eve accident in Texas.Her family held Apple responsible for not enabling ""lockout"" technology on the phone.The car was so badly damaged that Moriah and her father James had to be extracted from it, both in a critical condition.Moriah later died of her injuries in a local children's hospital.Police found Mr Wilhelm's intact phone still running the FaceTime application after the accident.The Modisette family alleged Apple was responsible for the accident as it had considered utilising technology to detect motion on its phones and disable certain functions when driving.Apple had patented this technology but it was not included on the iPhone 6.The lawsuit states Apple's iPhone 6 was ""defective"" and shouldn't have been shipped without the lock-out feature.It said Apple should pay damages for its ""wrongful failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design for which it sought a patent in December 2008"".Apple was granted the patent in April 2014 by the US patent office.In May, a court had dismissed the case, leading to the appeal.The appeals court agreed with the earlier decision, concluding Apple ""did not owe the Modisettes a duty of care"".It said it was not up to the tech giant to take responsibility for actions of individuals using its applications.The ruling determined the Modisettes ""cannot establish that Apple's design of the iPhone constituted a proximate cause of the injuries they suffered""."
technology	Just how bad is it for Apple?		I've been reflecting on Apple's news on Wednesday, that it was dramatically cutting its revenue forecasts for the first time in 16 years.Commentary on this seems to range from minor blip to complete disaster. But here’s how I see it.A few years ago, I could have told you the very day my phone was due for an upgrade, and I’d stride into a shop eager to get hold of the technology that had emerged in the year or so since I got my current handset.No longer. Fact is, the quality of phones now means we're not desperately counting down to getting a new one. That, and iPhones cost $1,000 now, which doesn’t help (but isn’t in itself the reason for Wednesday’s news, despite what everyone on Twitter keeps yelling at me).A better battery, a lack of big new features, terrific software that updates for free anyway… these are all factors that keep you happy with your device.This isn’t a surprise to anyone, not least Apple, which has been preparing for the iPhone’s downturn for a while now by a) putting in place plans to entice you, such as the Upgrade Program and, b) starting to aggressively move into new areas.Services, health and fitness, entertainment. It's done a simply spectacular job of building serious cash beyond selling hardware. The Services part of Apple makes almost as much money as Facebook's entire business. Apple is not a company in trouble.China’s economy, on the other hand, is - and it’s meant the iPhone's decline has happened much more quickly than Apple - or anyone - had bargained for. And for that you suspect, privately, Mr Cook holds the current US administration partly responsible. The trade war is trickling down and affecting consumer confidence, Mr Cook told shareholders.That's basically it. Now, what this might mean is a slow year (or more) while other parts of Apple grow to plug the gap. That process has started.Apple could take a more drastic step and get its chequebook out and snap up a Netflix or a Disney, as some have suggested. Apple can certainly afford it, and it will keep investors more than happy while the other stuff is ironed out.Or (or maybe, “and”) China's economy could improve, the trade war could be resolved, and Chinese Apple fans will no doubt go out en masse and shovel money into Tim Cook's pockets once again, making everything investors are worried about today seem like a brief, distant nightmare.________Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple	Blocked salesA mild protestMutually beneficial	"You don't need to look hard to see how the Global Times - the state-backed Chinese newspaper - is interpreting the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.""Washington's move to stifle Huawei will undermine itself,"" reads a headline. ""Banning Chinese companies like Huawei will isolate US from digital economy of the future,"" reads another.It's that second headline, the threat of isolation, that should give US technology companies considerable pause as we head into Ms Meng’s 12th day of detention in a Canadian jail.The fallout from her arrest will surely mean, at the very least, an even more difficult relationship for the handful of US tech giants that have found great fortune in China.In particular, Apple, the poster child for US tech success, and a company that relied on China for 20% of its revenues this past year.The Global Times said: ""Some Western countries are resorting to political means to resist Huawei's attempts to enter into their markets.""Failure to provide reciprocal opening-up means their companies won't get any benefits from China's digital economy.”“Look,” said analyst Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush, “the Huawei CFO situation... it’s the straw that could break the camel’s back.”China has long felt that the US is unfair to its big tech firms - in particular Huawei, which is the closest thing the country has to a true Apple competitor. While it doesn’t (yet) come close in terms of yearly revenue - $266bn for Apple against an expected $100bn or so for Huawei - the firm did manage to leapfrog Apple in global smartphone sales earlier this year. Huawei is now second only to Samsung.On Tuesday, a Chinese court banned the sale of older iPhone models as part of a long-running patent infringement lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm. Most legal observers had expected China to reject Qualcomm’s request for an injunction.There is no direct link between this action and the Huawei row. But taken against the backdrop of Ms Meng’s arrest, and ongoing tariff disputes, it’s being seen as a muscle-flexing display on the part of the Chinese.But the real success story for Huawei won’t come from smartphones, but the equipment that makes them worth having. Huawei is positioning itself as the vendor of choice for rolling out 5G technology, the next generation of mobile network.Put simply, if China thinks the US is unfairly hobbling the opportunity for Huawei to be a major player in 5G, it may retaliate and Apple could feel the brunt.""The last thing tech investors wanted to see was this news about the CFO of Huawei,” Mr Ives said.""It fuels the flames of further retaliation.”Mr Ives said Apple must feel like it has a “bullseye” on its back.Wedbush estimates 350m iPhones in use around the world are approaching the point when most people would want an upgrade, with around 70m of them in China.""You’re talking about a quarter of the incremental growth over the next three to four years is going to come from China.”Even without official intervention, the publicity hit Apple could suffer might make a dent in their Chinese revenues. Outside court in Vancouver, members of the city’s Chinese community have made their feelings clear, holding “Free Meng” signs and telling reporters they feel the US is bullying Huawei and, by extension, China.And according to internal memos obtained by Yahoo News, a number of Chinese companies have taken steps to promote their employees use Huawei products instead of Apple.“The news of Huawei CFO Ms Meng Wanzhou’s arrest by Canadian authorities has shocked the Chinese people,” a memo to staff at Jiangxi Ruike Refrigeration Technology is reported to have said, encouraging employees to trade in their iPhones for a Huawei device (in return for a healthy subsidy).But there is one aspect of Apple’s success in China that could mean it's spared Beijing’s wrath - even if Ms Meng finds herself extradited and even jailed.Apple of course doesn’t just sell products to China, it makes them there. In 2017, Apple estimated that between manufacture, retail, distribution - not to mention those developing for its software - it was responsible for 4.8m jobs in China.Further, the company has opened research centres that are providing a home in China for the country’s brightest graduates.""They have relationships with the Chinese government because they’ve been a massive employer,” Mr Ives said, suggesting Beijing might be limited in what action it could take as result.""By hurting Apple, it would to some extent be almost like burning down your own house.""Apple did not respond to requests for comment.________Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Mother and son 'tried to warn Apple of bug'	'Bug bounty'	"A mother and son from Arizona tried to warn Apple about the eavesdropping FaceTime bug over a week ago.The flaw, which gained attention on Monday, relates to the company’s FaceTime chat function.Michele Thompson and her 14-year-old son made several attempts to warn the firm, but say they were mostly ignored.“Short of smoke signals, I was trying every method that someone could use to get a hold of someone at Apple,” Ms Thompson told the Wall Street Journal.Apple has not yet commented, other than to say it will push a fix out to users in the coming days. In the meantime, the company has disabled the group calling function of FaceTime.According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Thompson, a lawyer, started contacting Apple on 20 January. On the 25, she posted a video on YouTube showing her and her son Grant demonstrating the flaw.On Monday, as news of the bug finally gained widespread attention, Ms Thompson wrote: ""I have letters, emails, tweets and msgs. sent to Apple for 10+ days reporting the Group FaceTime bug that lets someone listen in. My teenager discovered it! Never heard back from them.”Her efforts also included using Apple’s support system to file a bug report.""After several emails w/ Apple, they told me I could register as a developer to submit the bug report which I did (even though I’m the farthest thing from a developer),” she wrote.""Also emailed it directly to product-security@apple with full details.""Apple, like many technology companies, has a “bug bounty” programme that pays people for finding new bugs in its products. Ms Thompson said she hoped her son would benefit.""I would love for my 14-year-old to be rewarded for reporting this. Even a thanks would be amazing!”The flaw, first revealed by the 9to5Mac blog, appears to occur when both users are running version 12.1 of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, or newer. It also affects Mac users when they are called from an iPhone.The technique involves using the software's group chat function, apparently confusing the software into activating the target's microphone, even if the call has not been accepted.The eavesdropping ends when the call is cut after too many rings.Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher, told the BBC that Apple is likely to deal with a large number of bug reports, which can take time to sort through and prioritise.""Many companies typically aim for 90 days to resolve reported security issues, and much of that time can be spent reaching the right people and setting the right priorities.""It appears the mother and son attempting to report this issue were passed around departments by Apple. That isn't ideal, and something Apple needs to work on."""
technology	Apple denies iPhone sales ban in China		"US chip-maker Qualcomm claims it has won an injunction against Apple that effectively bans the import and sale of a number of iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone X.The preliminary order, issued by a Chinese court, is the latest step in a continuing feud between the two tech giants over intellectual property.However, Apple says all of its iPhone models remain on sale in the country.The disputed patents relate to software rather than hardware.The injunction affects devices running older versions of Apple's iOS operating system and not those running the latest version, iOS 12.The court found Apple had violated two of Qualcomm's patents - one regarding photograph resizing and the other related to how apps are managed on a touch screen.""Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us,"" said Don Rosenberg, general counsel of Qualcomm.However, Apple responded that the attempted ban was ""another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world"".The company added it would ""pursue all our legal options through the courts"".In January 2017, Apple filed two lawsuits against Qualcomm, claiming it had abused its dominant market position as a chip-maker.In July the same year, Qualcomm claimed that iPhones using chips by rivals, such as Intel, infringed six of its patents."
technology	Samsung Nigeria tweets update using Apple iPhone		"Samsung Mobile's promotional Twitter account in Nigeria has been caught sending updates about the Korean firm's phones via an Apple iPhone.YouTuber Marques Brownlee spotted the mistake and shared an image of a tweet sent out using the iPhone Twitter app.A separate analysis suggested that more than 300 of its tweets had been sent via the same mobile app.The @SamsungMobileNG account was shut down and deleted soon after news of the mistake started to spread.The offending tweet was being used to promote the organic LED display of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9.The gaffe was revealed by the tweet bearing the words ""via Twitter for iPhone"" in its bottom right-hand corner.Twitter analyst Luca Hammer trawled through 3,200 tweets sent by the Nigeria account and found that more than 10% (331) bore the same revealing message.The Samsung Nigeria account has now been reinstated, but the offending tweets have been removed from its historical feed.This is not the first time Mr Brownlee has noticed one firm's products being promoted via those of its rivals.In September, Mr Brownlee noticed that Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, who was paid by Google to promote its Pixel 2 phone, sent the tweets via an iPhone app.Other celebrities using iPhones to promote Samsung's gadgets include actress Gal Gadot and Indian tennis star Sania Mirza.The most infamous example of this practice took place in Russia when Samsung brand ambassador Ksenia Sobchak was photographed in public and on TV using an Apple iPhone X. Samsung sued her for $1.6m (£1.26m) claiming breach of contract."
technology	Disney+ hit by technical glitches on launch day		"Disney's new online streaming service, Disney+, has been hit by technical issues on its first day.There have been many reports on social media about problems accessing the service and some users have shared screenshots of error messages.Disney+ offers a catalogue of Disney films along with exclusive content such as the new Star Wars series The Mandalorian.Via Twitter, Disney said demand had ""exceeded our highest expectations"".Glitch-tracker Down Detector recorded nearly 8,300 complaints about Disney+ over a 15-minute period starting at 14:00 GMT (09:00 EST).Disney+ is not yet offered worldwide, but is being rolled out to the US, Canada and the Netherlands first.Disney said it was ""working quickly"" to resolve issues with the service.The platform will compete with other major film and TV streaming services - including Netflix and Amazon Prime.Disney has estimated it will need to attract at least 60 million subscribers, putting it on a par with Netflix, in order for Disney+ to break even."
technology	Disney+ fans without answers after thousands hacked	Dark web	"Thousands of Disney customers say they have been hacked after signing up to its online streaming service.Since Disney+ went live, attackers have stolen thousands of customers' accounts and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to a report.People waited on telephone and online chat lines for hours, and many still say that Disney has yet to sort their problems.But the firm says it does not believe its systems have been compromised.""Disney takes the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+,"" a spokesman said.The statement indicates that members' details have been stolen by other means.That could involve spyware on users' devices or the re-use of login details stolen from elsewhere.Disney's answer to Netflix, Disney+ is an online platform where fans can view its movies, short films and TV shows, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises.Ten million people signed up in its first week.Disney+ has not yet launched in the UK, but is available in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.On 12 November, its first day live, people had technical problems and many complained on social media.Others said they were locked out of their accounts, and since they contacted Disney they have not heard back.According to an investigation by Zdnet, thousands of user accounts went on sale on the dark web.Only hours after the service launched, hackers were selling Disney+ accounts for as little as $3 (£2.30).A subscription to the service costs $7 (£5.40) a month.With the help of a cyber-security researcher, the BBC also found several hacked customer accounts for sale on the dark web.Thousands of these stolen accounts show what kind of subscription the person signed up with and when it expires.Customers say they saw their emails and passwords changed.Many say they used unique userIDs and passwords to access the streaming platform.But Jason Hill, a lead researcher with CyberInt, says it looks like many were stolen because people use the same passwords for different sites.Mr Hill said that hackers can lift someone's password from a different site which has previously been hacked and then try it on a new site, like Disney+. If it works, they steal the account.""Whilst many may consider having a unique password for each online service to be difficult to manage, password managers simplify this process and allow you to generate and securely store unique difficult-to-guess passwords,"" he said.The streaming service does not have two-factor authentication.This is when a separate password is sent upon login, to verify an account identity.Others are concerned because they can use their Disney+ login to access other products the company provides, like the Disney store and its recreation parks.The online streaming service was hit by technical issues on its first day. People took to social media to complain that their pre-ordered streaming service did not work and that they faced long waits for customer service.The company said in a tweet that it had an ""overwhelming response"" and apologised."

Often it can take time for things to stabilise after such a massive outage, which can lead to intermittent service for a period of time after the original problems."""
technology	Sex workers' clients exposed by Dutch hack attack	Potential blackmail	"Account details of more than 250,000 people who used a site for sex workers in the Netherlands have been stolen in a hack attack.Email addresses, user names and encrypted passwords were stolen from a site called Hookers.nl.The attacker is believed to have exploited a bug in its chat room software found last month.Reports suggest the malicious hacker who took the data has offered it for sale on a dark web marketplace.Hookers.nl was ""not happy"" about the attack, its media spokesman Tom Lobermann told Dutch broadcaster NOS.Mr Lobermann said sex workers who used the site and the clients who visited them could be put at risk if their data were to be stolen and sold. He said the site had informed everyone who had an account about the breach.The message sent by the site's administrators also advised people to change their passwords.NOS technology editor Joost Schellevis, who had seen a selection of data from the files being offered for sale, said identifying site users via their email addresses would not be difficult.Mr Schellevis contacted the suspected thief who said he felt no guilt over the attack.The accused told NOS: ""I am not the devil. It is not a question of whether your website is hacked, but when.""The hacker added that several people were interested in buying the data.Hookers.nl used a popular program for hosting online forums and discussions called vBulletin. In late September, security researchers identified a vulnerability in the program that could be exploited to steal data.VBulletin quickly produced a patch for the bug but several sites were breached before they could deploy and install the protection.Prash Somaiya, technical program manager at HackerOne, said attacking a site like Hookers.nl was a ""double win"" for cyber-criminals because they could sell the data and potentially blackmail users.He added: ""Other opportunist criminals seeing the news may also use it to attempt to phish any possible users by posing as the original attacker to blackmail anyone who falls for their scam."""
technology	Blizzard gamers complain they cannot boycott firm over China		"Gamers are complaining they are unable to delete their Activision Blizzard accounts, as they attempt to show solidarity with an e-sports competitor.The US publisher caused controversy by placing a 12-month ban on a player who had voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong on Sunday.Users say they get error messages when they try to erase their accounts. Some suggest it could be deliberate.But the firm has indicated a technical problem is to blame.""There's an issue affecting the site which our engineers are currently addressing... it's a priority for us to have this resolved,"" one of its North America accounts tweeted.The BBC's request for a comment has not yet been answered.Some players in Europe have said they are able to cancel their profiles but have raised concerns that they are being asked to first upload government-issued IDs.The firm has defended this on the grounds that it needs to be sure of their identity as the process cannot be reversed.Activision Blizzard is behind some of the most popular console, PC and mobile video games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.Now some players, who have been unable to wipe their accounts, are threatening to tell their banks to block the company from deducting payments.Protests began after the firm banned professional video game player, Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung.After playing its Hearthstone online card game at a tournament, Blitzchung had called out in Mandarin, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" during a live-streamed interview.The organisers wrote in a statement that the 21-year-old had broken competition rules and would not receive any prize money.On 8 October, he was told he would not be allowed to compete professionally at Hearthstone for one year.The hashtag #Blizzardboycott subsequently trended on Twitter.And since then, the firm has faced a growing backlash from both customers and some employees.The Daily Beast news site reported that a small group of workers at the company's Los Angeles office staged a walkout in protest.The matter has also drawn the attention of US politicians.The row threatens to overshadow one of the firm's biggest releases of the year - its latest Call of Duty console title - which is due to go on sale on 25 October."

We are aware of the issue and are working towards a resolution.""The issue began shortly after 0800 GMT, according to Down Detector.For some, the site continued to be intermittently accessible for several hours while the issue persisted.""I've had to talk to real people and that's a little bit frightening,"" joked social media consultant David Schneider.""Genuinely, I didn't know where to get my news from, I usually put a tweet out in the morning.""Mr Schneider, who runs consultancy That Lot told the BBC that he did feel there was a genuine sense of community on Twitter which he missed.""I just hope we'll get through the trauma,"" he joked.The fault would probably seem like an ""unwelcome headache"" for Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, according to consultants Frost & Sullivan.There were also issues with Twitter's application program interface (API), which allows websites and apps to connect to Twitter, principal analyst Sheridan Nye told the BBC.""The loss of the micro-blogging site's APIs multiplied the issue for all manner of developers, companies and organisations,"" she said.Ms Nye added that there could be serious consequences for some businesses if downtime went on for long periods.""Any company that was in the process of launching a new digital product would have lost valuable marketing insight,"" she said.Recently launched apps might not have been able to take advantage of live feedback on the site, Ms Nye said - something which Barclays took advantage of following the launch of the bank's PingIt payments app last year.""Barclays found out that under-18s were annoyed that they couldn't use the service - so Barclays quickly modified the service to allow them access,"" Ms Nye said."
technology	Google and Mozilla move to stop Kazakhstan 'snooping'		"Google and Mozilla have moved to block the Kazakhstan government from intercepting internet traffic.It comes after reports internet services providers in the country have required people to install a government-issued certificate on all devices and in every browser.The government said the software was a security measure.But Google and Mozilla said it would allow the government to decrypt and read anything a user types or posts.The country has a poor human rights record by international standards.The Ministry of Digital Development in the former Soviet republic said telecoms operators in the capital, Nur-Sultan, were carrying out technical work to ""enhance protection"" from hackers, online fraud and other cyber-attacks.But Google and Mozilla are not convinced by the explanation and said they would deploy ""a technical solution"" to their browsers to block the certificates.""We will never tolerate any attempt, by any organisation - government or otherwise - to compromise Chrome users' data,"" said Chrome senior engineering director Parisa Tabriz.""We have implemented protections from this specific issue, and will always take action to secure our users around the world.""Mozilla senior director of trust and security Marshall Erwin said: ""People around the world trust Firefox to protect them as they navigate the internet, especially when it comes to keeping them safe from attacks like this that undermine their security.""We don't take actions like this lightly but protecting our users and the integrity of the web is the reason Firefox exists.""Technology website The Hacker News said Apple had also blocked Kazakhstan government certificates from its Safari browser.In 2015, the Kazakhstan government attempted to have similar software installed on Mozilla's browser.The request was denied and attempts to require citizens to install it manually failed following legal action.According to researchers at Censored Planet, who have been tracking the interception system in Kazakhstan, only a handful of sites were being monitored, including Facebook, Twitter and Google."
technology	'I was a victim of the WhatsApp hack'		"In April, Faustin Rukundo received a mysterious call over WhatsApp from a number he did not recognise.He answered, but the line was silent and then it went dead. He tried calling back but nobody answered.He didn't know it but his phone had been compromised.As a Rwandan exile living in Leeds, Mr Rukundo was already privacy conscious. He searched for the number online and found the dialling code was from Sweden.Strange, he thought. But he soon forgot about it.Then the number called once more. Again nobody picked up.There were also missed calls from other numbers he did not recognise and he began to get worried about his family's safety, so he bought a new phone.Within a day, the unknown number called again.""I tried to answer and they hung up before I heard any voice,"" Mr Rukundo told the BBC.""Whenever I called back, no-one answered. I realised something was wrong when I started seeing files missing from the phone.""I spoke to my colleagues at the Rwanda National Congress and they too had similar experiences. They were getting missed calls from the same numbers as me.""The Rwanda National Congress is a group that opposes the Rwandan regime.It was not until May, when Mr Rukundo read reports that WhatsApp had been hacked, that he realised what had happened.""I first read the story about the WhatsApp hack on the BBC and thought, 'Wow, this could explain what's happened to me,'"" he said.""I changed my phone and realised my mistake. They were following my number around and putting the spy software on each new device by calling the same number.""For months, Mr Rukundo was convinced that he and his colleagues were some of the estimated 1,400 people targeted by attackers exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp.But it was only confirmed to him this week following a call from Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.For six months, the organisation has been working with Facebook to investigate the hack and find out who was affected.Researchers there say: ""As part of our investigation into the incident, Citizen Lab has identified over 100 cases of abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe.""Mr Rukundo's profile as an outspoken critic of the Rwandan regime is consistent with the sort of people who were targets for this spyware.It was allegedly built and sold by the Israel-based NSO Group and sold to governments around the world.Hackers used the software to spy on journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and diplomats.Mr Rukundo says he has not had any calls since the original hack, but the experience has made him and his family feel paranoid and scared.""Honestly, even before they confirmed this, we were gutted and terrified. It looks like they only bugged my phone for around two weeks but they had access to everything,"" he told the BBC.""Not only my activity during that time but my whole email history and all my contacts and connections. Everything is watched, the computers, our phones, nothing is safe. Even when we talk, they could be listening. I still don't feel safe.""Mr Rukundo fled Rwanda in 2005 when critics of the government were being arrested and jailed. He says he fought to have his wife released after she was kidnapped and detained for two months on a family visit in 2007.Facebook, the owner of WhatsApp, is attempting to sue the NSO Group.The NSO Group denies any wrongdoing.In court documents, Facebook accuses the company of exploiting a then-unknown vulnerability in WhatsApp.The app is used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries.The service is popular for its end-to-end encryption, which means messages are scrambled as they travel across the internet, making them unreadable if intercepted.The filing at the US District Court of Northern California describes how the spyware was allegedly installed.The powerful software known as Pegasus is an NSO Group product that can remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from mobile devices, by sharing all phone activity including communications and location data with the attacker.In previous spyware attacks, victims have been tricked into downloading the software by clicking on booby-trapped web links.But with the WhatsApp hack, Facebook alleges that it was installed on victims' phones without them taking any action at all.The company says that between January 2018 and May 2019, NSO Group created WhatsApp accounts using telephone numbers registered in different counties, including Cyprus, Israel, Brazil, Indonesia, Sweden and the Netherlands.Then in April and May, the victims were attacked with a phone call over WhatsApp, it is claimed.The filing says: ""To avoid the technical restrictions built into WhatsApp Signaling Servers, defendants formatted call initiation messages containing malicious code to appear like a legitimate call and concealed the code within call settings.""Disguising the malicious code as call settings enabled defendants to deliver it to the target device and made the malicious code appear as if it originated from WhatsApp Signaling Servers.""The victims would be completely unaware that they had been bugged.

""Our teams continue to investigate the problem to ensure this doesn't happen again.""He added: ""We will be publishing more details about the problem in due course on the BBC's internet blog.""The duration of the outage led reporters to question BBC boss Tony Hall about the problems on a day when the corporation unveiled its annual report.Mr Hall said that he would look into the cause of the problems and added: ""99.9% of the time the iPlayer works very well"".While the iPlayer was not working the corporation put out statements via Twitter apologising several times for the inconvenience.The apology did not mollify many people who strongly criticised the BBC about the length of the disruption.The problems for the iPlayer and many other sites started on the morning of 19 July when engineers noticed that there was a ""severe load"" on the servers underlying the video-on-demand system.In addition, reports reached the BBC that viewers were getting slow response times for some services or were seeing errors saying a programme or clip was not available.Soon after the BBC noticed, messages were also received from network engineers at internet service providers (ISPs) including Virgin Media, which were also logging problems with the iPlayer and other BBC video traffic.Later in the day, the service became unavailable via the web and through smartphone apps.Internal logs of the incident and how it was handled showed that database administrators, network engineers and system analysts were all called on to see if they could diagnose the problem and fix it.Work continued throughout the weekend to try to stabilise the servers and database supporting the iPlayer and many other BBC services.The final fixes for the problems were expected to be applied on 21 July when the vast majority of people should be able reach the web-based video services as normal.The BBC said it would issue a statement when it knew more about the cause of the glitches."
technology	Musk promises '10km Hyperloop tunnel' in 2020		Elon Musk says he wants a new 10km (six-mile) vacuum tunnel for his futuristic Hyperloop - ready for next year's speed-record competition.Hyperloop aims to transport people in high-speed pods in underground tubes.Mr Musk tweeted his plan after the Technical University of Munich set a new record for the fourth year running.Its pod reached 463km/h (288mph) on the current test tube in the US, which runs for 1.6km straight. Mr Musk said the new vacuum tube would be curved.Ultimately, Hyperloop trains will aim for a top speed of 1,220km/h (700mph).The idea received investment from Richard Branson's Virgin group, which is developing a passenger system called Hyperloop One that it says will have a top speed of 1,080km/h (670mph).
technology	Minecraft ditches Super Duper graphics plan	'Disappointing'	"Minecraft will be keeping its block-based look for the foreseeable future as plans to update its graphics are cancelled.In a statement Minecraft developer Mojang said it had ended development on what was known as the Super Duper graphics pack for the game.The pack would have given the game realistic textures, lighting effects and all-round better graphics.The pack has proved ""too technically demanding"" so has been ditched.The plan to make Minecraft look more realistic was unveiled in 2017 at the E3 games show. The ambitious plan was to make a downloadable add-on that all but did away with the basic, blocky look of the massively popular game.In 2017, Mojang said its work also would produce an add-on for the Xbox version of Minecraft that let the game run at a resolution of 4K on the console.Originally the Super Duper add-on was due to appear in autumn 2017 but the release date was pushed back to 2018 before being cancelled altogether in 2019.The technical demands of the update have proved too much, it said in a short apology.It added: ""We realise this is disappointing to some of you - there was a lot of enthusiasm for Super Duper from inside and outside the studio - but unfortunately, we aren't happy with how the pack performed across devices.""Mojang added that it was not entirely finished with improving the look of Minecraft on different game-playing gadgets and said it would share more information about this work soon."
technology	Iran social media block removed by technical hitch	Trade blockAnalysis	"Direct access to Facebook and Twitter was briefly restored in Iran on Monday evening.The social media sites have been blocked since 2009 after they were used to organise protests.On Monday the block was briefly lifted for some Iranians - but the authorities blamed ""technical problems"", stressing the official policy had not changed.The hitch comes as US trade sanctions force the closure of an Iranian opposition leader's website.Late on Monday, Western journalists working in Iran reported that they had suddenly gained direct access to Twitter and Facebook.Thomas Erdbrink, Tehran bureau chief for the New York Times, sent several tweets via his mobile phone without the need to go via a proxy that circumvents official blocks.By Siavash ArdalanBBC PersianThe jubilation of Iran's social media users was tempered by speculation that the temporary Facebook and Twitter comeback was a ploy to identify users or just test the waters.Many Iranians have learned not to be over-optimistic about overnight reforms, be it political freedoms, human rights, foreign policy or internet access.Iran's new government is promoting internet freedom. They have a tough job as those in charge of the country's widespread filtering mechanism do not take orders from President Hassan Rouhani.Hardliners have good reason to be wary of allowing full internet access to information and entertainment to a young, freedom-craving population. The security implications of doing so can become an unmanageable challenge - and an unnecessary one as far as the real decision-makers are concerned.Most Iranians who want to use social media have typically used proxies or other special software to get around the government imposed firewall.Iranians reacted with cautious optimism when they realised Facebook and Twitter were freely accessible.""If it is true, I think they have to register today in calendar as a day of Free Filtering,"" user Abbas Farokhi told BBC Persian.Another, Benyamin HM, said: ""Do not get over excited, it has happened because of some technical problems. It will be filtered again and we have to use proxy.""Initially it was thought the block was being lifted for everyone in Iran, signalling the start of a more tolerant attitude towards social media by the government.In recent weeks some Iranian government officials and ministers have signed up for accounts on Facebook and Twitter.This led to confusion earlier this month over whether President Hassan Rouhani had tweeted ""Happy Rosh Hashana"" to Iran's Jewish community. A message came from a Twitter account thought to belong to Mr Rouhani, but officials later said he did not have any such account.Early on Tuesday Reuters reported that official policy had not changed and ""technical faults"" had mistakenly led to the restrictions being lifted.It quoted Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, who heads the committee that oversees Iran's net filters, as saying it was looking into the hitch.""We are investigating to see which of these companies has done this,"" he said.At the same time, the website of Iranian opposition politician Mehdi Karoubi has been shut down by the Just Host service at the request of the US Treasury Department.Sanctions restrict what services US companies can supply to Iranians and this extends to hosting websites that use the country's .ir domain suffix.An aide for Mr Karoubi said the action by the US was ""frustrating""."
technology	Blocking research with China would 'hurt', Microsoft boss says	Technology as weapon'Leaves me wondering...'	"Microsoft does more research and development in China than it does anywhere else outside the United States. But, as US-China relations continue to sour on issues of trade and cyber-security, the decades-long ties Microsoft has in China are coming under close scrutiny.In an interview with BBC News, Microsoft's chief executive Satya Nadella has said that despite national security concerns, backing out of China would “hurt more” than it solved.“A lot of AI research happens in the open, and the world benefits from knowledge being open,” he said.""That to me is been what's been true since the Renaissance and the scientific revolution. Therefore, I think, for us to say that we will put barriers on it may in fact hurt more than improve the situation everywhere.”Microsoft’s first office in China was opened by founder and then-chief executive Bill Gates in 1992. Its main location in Beijing now employs more than 200 scientists and involves over 300 visiting scholars and students. It is currently recruiting for, among other roles, researchers in machine learning.In April, it was reported by the Financial Times that Microsoft researchers were collaborating with teams at China’s National University of Defence Technology, working on artificial intelligence projects that some outside observers warned could be used for oppressive means.Speaking to the newspaper, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said: “American companies need to understand that doing business in China carries significant and deepening risk.”He added: ""In addition to being targeted by the Chinese Communist party for espionage, American companies are increasingly at risk of boosting the Chinese Communist party’s human rights atrocities.""Mr Nadella acknowledged that risk.“We know any technology can be a tool or a weapon,” he told the BBC.“The question is, how do you ensure that these weapons don't get created? I think there are multiple mechanisms. The first thing is we, as creators, should start with having a set of ethical design principles to ensure that we're creating AI that's fair, that's secure, that's private, that's not biased.”He said he felt his company had sufficient control over how the controversial emerging technologies are used, and said the firm had turned down requests in China - and elsewhere - to engage in projects it felt were inappropriate, due to either technical infeasibility or ethical concerns.“We do have control on who gets to use our technology. And we do have principles. Beyond how we build it, how people use it is something that we control through Terms of Use. And we are constantly evolving the terms of use.""We also recognise whether it's in the United States, whether it's in China, whether it's in the United Kingdom, they will all have their own legislative processes on what they accept or don't accept, and we will abide by them.”Matt Sheehan, from the Paulson Institute, studies the relationship between California's technology scene and the Chinese economy. He said Microsoft's efforts, particularly its Beijing office, have had tremendous impact.""It dramatically advanced the field, advances that have helped the best American and European AI research labs push further,"" he said.""But those same advances feed into the field of computer vision, a key enabler of China's surveillance apparatus.""He cites one particular paper as highlighting the complexity of working with, and within, China. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, published in 2016, was a research paper produced by four Chinese researchers working at Microsoft.According to Google Scholar, which indexes research papers, their paper was cited more than 25,256 times between 2014-2018 - more than any other paper in any other field of research.""The lead author now works for a US tech company in California,"" said Mr Sheehan, referring to Facebook.""Two other authors work for a company involved in Chinese surveillance. And the last author is trying to build autonomous vehicles in China.""What do we make of all that? Honestly, it leaves me - and I think it should leave others - scratching their heads and wondering.""_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Three to launch 5G service in August	Is 5G safe?	"Three will launch its first 5G network this August in London, before extending it to 25 other UK towns and cities before the end of the year.The telecoms company will kick off with a home broadband service in the capital but is also launching mobile services.It follows BT's EE and Vodafone in launching next generation 5G services in 2019.Three, which is owned by Hutchison, said it would not share details about the cost of its services until July.Chief executive Dave Dyson said: ""It's clear that consumers and businesses want more and more data.""We have worked hard over a long period of time to be able to offer the best end-to-end 5G experience.EE launched 5G services in six cities in May, while Vodafone will launch one on 3 July.According to some, 5G will offer download speeds as much as 100 times faster than existing 4G networks.However, there have been concerns about the pricing and connectivity of such services.Both have also pulled smartphones made by the Chinese company Huawei from their 5G launches, because of uncertainty about support by Google's Android.The race for 5G is hotting up - even if Three is arriving with what feels like rather a lukewarm offering.While EE and Vodafone will both have 5G mobile phones in the hands of customers in a number of cities next month, Three is still only saying that its mobile offering will be rolled out ""by the end of 2019"".Its home broadband service is launching in London in August but we still don't know how it will be priced. 5G as a substitute for fixed broadband is an attractive idea - though possibly more useful in remote areas where firms are reluctant to lay fibre connections.But Three is confident that it has acquired more useful spectrum than its rivals, and when consumers really start to take an interest in 5G next year it will be well-placed to race ahead.The US has restricted Google and others from using Huawei technology amid concerns it could be used by Beijing for spying - claims which the Chinese firm has denied.Three said it would announce details of which handsets will be part of its mobile launch in July.It has suggested its own 5G network will be the fastest in the UK, claiming peak speeds could be more than twice as fast as its rivals.After London it plans to launch in: Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Sunderland before the end of the year.Analysis by BBC Reality CheckSome people have questioned whether there are health risks from 5G, but experts and regulators say there is no evidence of danger.Similar fears were expressed around earlier mobile internet and wi-fi.More than 200 scientists appealed to the EU to halt the rollout of 5G, saying that electromagnetic fields may be harmful to humans and the environment, and could increase cancer risks.But the EU says exposure from 5G will be far below limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).""There has been no evidence to suggest that electromagnetic waves from mobile phones and networks are bad for your health,"" says Prof Malcolm Sperrin, Director of the Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.He says a causal link between mobile phone use and cancer in humans is unproven.5G technology is new but experts believe it poses no greater risk than earlier mobile systems."
technology	Fortnite pro Jarvis banned for using cheat software	'Huge mistake'	"More than four million people have watched a video in which a pro Fortnite player makes an emotional appeal to have a permanent ban lifted.Jarvis Khattri was banned for using cheating software while playing the popular game.Fortnite creator Epic imposed the ban even though Mr Khattri used the software on a game account separate to the one he uses to compete and stream.Fans of Mr Khattri lobbied Epic via social media to get the ban lifted.Fortnite is a ""battle-royale"" type game which allows up to 100 players to fight individually or as part of a team to be the last standing on a virtual battlefield. Players gather materials to build structures which can prove crucial in the game's close-quarters firefights.The type of ban imposed on Mr Khattri is believed to include key identifying details about the hardware he uses to play, and the net account through which he connects. This means it will be difficult for him to set up a new account and start playing again.In a statement, Epic said it had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" for anyone using cheat software.The software Mr Khattri used is known as an aimbot, which helps players land shots on opposing characters.""When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly,"" Epic said.In a tweet, Mr Khattri said he took ""accountability"" for his actions.He added: ""I just wish I had known how severe the consequences were at the time and I would have never thought about doing it.""The UK-based player expressed similar remorse in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel on which he currently has about two million subscribers.He said: ""Obviously this is a huge mistake and it's completely wrong on my end.""Some of Mr Khattri's followers started using the #FreeJarvis hashtag to gain support for their call to have the ban lifted. Some pointed out that Epic had only imposed bans of two weeks on other pro players who were caught colluding during a recent tournament.The ban prompted a spat between popular gaming streamers Ninja and DrLupo during an online chat.Ninja, aka Tyler Blevins, who rose to fame through Fortnite, said Epic should be more lenient towards content creators who help the game thrive. DrLupo, aka Benjamin Lupo, had less sympathy, and said the ban was justified."
technology	Biostar security software 'leaked a million fingerprints'	Suprema 'hung up'Police checking	"More than a million fingerprints and other sensitive data have been exposed online by a biometric security firm, researchers say.Researchers working with cyber-security firm VPNMentor say they accessed data from a security tool called Biostar 2.It is used by thousands of companies worldwide, including the UK's Metropolitan Police, to control access to specific parts of secure facilities.Suprema, the firm that offers Biostar 2, said it was addressing the issue.""If there has been any definite threat on our products and/or services, we will take immediate actions and make appropriate announcements to protect our customers' valuable businesses and assets,"" a company spokesman told the Guardian.According to VPNMentor, the exposed data, discovered on 5 August, was made private on 13 August.It is not clear how long it was accessible.As well as fingerprint records, the researchers say they found photographs of people, facial recognition data, names, addresses, passwords, employment history and records of when they had accessed secure areas.Since news of the data exposure broke, some have questioned the extent to which real fingerprint data was made available.However, the cyber-security researchers say they stand by their research.Suprema said in a statement to the BBC it was aware of reports of the breach and was taking them ""very seriously"".""[Suprema] is investigating the allegations in the press reports and will liaise with any appropriate third parties and/or individuals as necessary.""At this stage, it cannot make any further comment but will, if appropriate, issue a further press statement in due course, including corrections of any erroneous assertions in the reports to date.""Among the UK organisations directly affected by the breach was Tile Mountain, a homeware retailer.Biostar 2 was only used at the company's head office in Stoke on Trent, IT director Colin Hampson said.He said that since 26 February 2018 Tile Mountain had not been an ""active client"" of Suprema's and had instead stored biometric data on its own secure internal servers.""Despite Tile Mountain not being an active client of Suprema it is concerning that no contact was made to inform us that data may have been compromised - this could potentially have prevented Tile Mountain from carrying out its obligations under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation],"" he added.""It's crazy, just crazy,"" Noam Rotem, one of the researchers who found the data, told the BBC.He pointed out that biometric information such as fingerprints could never be made private again once lost.He said he and his colleagues had had difficulty when trying to report the exposed data to Suprema.""We started calling all of the offices one by one and had to deal with people just hanging up the phone,"" he said.In total, 23 gigabytes of data containing nearly 30 million records were found exposed online.""This could be used in a wide range of criminal activities that would be disastrous for both the businesses and organisations affected, as well as their employees or clients,"" said VPNMentor in a blog about the discovery.The data leak was ""horrendous"", according to Simon Birchall, managing director for Timeware, a British firm that installs Suprema fingerprint readers.Mr Birchall said Timeware had developed its own software for the devices and did not provide Biostar 2 to clients.""It looks like someone has taken the standard Biostar 2 product and installed it on an open network,"" he told the BBC. ""It's just silly what they've done.""Mr Rotem told the BBC that a number of British companies had been affected.However, he was not able to confirm their names because he and his team did not download all the data they found in order to limit the privacy implications of the breach.A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told the BBC that the force was now checking whether it was one of the affected organisations.Among other firms whose data was discovered were:The UK Information Commissioner's Office said it was aware of reports about Biostar 2 and would be making enquiries."
technology	Crime prediction software 'adopted by 14 UK police forces'	Predictive softwareRisk scores	"At least 14 UK police forces have made use of crime-prediction software or plan to do so, according to Liberty.The human rights group said it had sent a total of 90 Freedom of Information requests out last year to discover which forces used the technology.It believes the programs involved can lead to biased policing strategies that unfairly focus on ethnic minorities and lower-income communities.And it said there had been a ""severe lack of transparency"" about the matter.Defenders of the technology say it can provide new insights into gun and knife crime, sex trafficking and other potentially life-threatening offences at a time when police budgets are under pressure.One of the named forces - Avon and Somerset Police - said it had invited members of the press in to see the Qlik system it used in action, to raise public awareness.""We make every effort to prevent bias in data models,"" said a spokeswoman.""For this reason the data... does not include ethnicity, gender, address location or demographics.""But Liberty said the technologies lacked proper oversight, and moreover there was no clear evidence that they had led to safer communities.""These opaque computer programs use algorithms to analyse hordes of biased police data, identifying patterns and embedding an approach to policing which relies on discriminatory profiling,"" its report said.""[They] entrench pre-existing inequalities while being disguised as cost-effective innovations.""Liberty's report focuses on two types of software, which are sometimes used side-by-side.The first is ""predictive mapping"", in which crime ""hotspots"" are mapped out, leading to more patrols in the area.The second is called ""individual risk assessment"", which attempts to predict how likely an individual is to commit an offence or be a victim of a crime.The report says the following forces had already used one or both types or were planning to do so:Companies that develop such applications include IBM, Microsoft, Predpol and Palantir and there are efforts to create bespoke solutions.The BBC contacted each of the named forces and two responded that they had already stopped using the technology.Cheshire Police said it had trialled a mapping program between January and November 2015 but had since stopped using the system.And Kent Police confirmed it had introduced a predictive policing mapping tool in 2013 but had subsequently decided not to renew its contract, as reported last year.""The launch of a new policing model that places victims and witnesses at its centre has led Kent Police to evaluate alternative options which will support a focus on both traditional and emerging crime types,"" a spokeswoman said.Several forces, however, are involved in a £4.5m ""proof-of-concept project"", called the National Data Analytics Solution (NDAS), which is funded by the Home Office.It draws on information already held by the police about roughly five million people, including incident logs, custody records and conviction histories.Using machine-learning techniques, the aim is to calculate a risk score for individuals as to their likelihood of committing crimes in the future.In addition, the police hope to use the system to identify which members of their own workforce need support to help reduce illness.West Midlands Police leads the effort. The others involved include Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, Merseyside Police, West Yorkshire Police, Warwickshire and West Mercia Police.""We want to see analytics being used to justify investment in social mobility in this time of harmful austerity, addressing deep-rooted inequalities and helping to prevent crime,"" said Tom McNeil, strategic adviser to the effort.""To support this we have appointed a diverse ethics panel placing human rights at the centre.""However, a report by the Alan Turing Institute - which was commissioned by the police - raised concerns that those involved had been too vague about how they planned to address the risks involved."
technology	BBC News disrupted by software glitch		"The BBC had to replace live broadcasts with recorded material on its TV news channels for about an hour on Wednesday following a technical glitch.The News at Six and News at Ten were also presented from the BBC's Millbank studio instead of the usual facilities at New Broadcasting House.The issue affected OpenMedia, a new computer system rolled out across BBC News outlets over the past six months.OpenMedia supplier Annova has been helping to investigate the fault.Engineers believe they have now addressed the problem.BBC News Home Editor Mark Easton shared on social media that he was rushing across London to the Millbank studio.The location, which has a large angular desk rather than the usual round one, is used for the daily Politics Live programme.The BBC website has been unaffected by the issue.From about 15:00 BST, the BBC News Channel and BBC World News were unable to broadcast live, relying instead on recorded material.OpenMedia was designed to make it easier for reporters and other staff to share scripts, running orders and contacts.One of its promised benefits is to provide ""stability and reliability"".BBC News has faced problems with the introduction of new technology in the past, including robot-operated cameras that failed to stay centred on presenters."
technology	Cookie monster eats data from Sesame Street store		"The official Sesame Street online store, along with thousands of other retailers, has been targeted by a credit card-stealing hack.Card details were collected by a piece of malicious software, dubbed JavaScript Cookie.The code was found in shopping cart software built by Volusion, which has 20,000 small business customers.The issue was spotted by a security researcher while shopping for toys on the Sesame Street store.Volusion said that it had resolved the issue ""within a few hours of notification"" although its statement came a day after the revelations.""We are coordinating with authorities on this matter, and continue to enhance our systems that detect and prevent unauthorised access to user accounts,"" it told the BBC.It confirmed that credit card information had been stolen but ""not other associated personally identifying details"", adding that it was not aware ""of any fraudulent activity"" connected to it.Marcel Afrahim, a researcher at security firm Check Point, noticed the malicious code when he was browsing on the Sesame Street Live store.In a blog, he wrote: ""The compromise is not only unique to Sesame Street Store, and most likely any e-commerce website hosted on Volusion is probably running malicious code and posting the credit card info of the consumers to the outsider domain.""He added that he had contacted Volusion but ""it had not been responsive to take down down the malicious code.""The Sesame Street site is currently not active. Instead visitors see a message that reads: ""We are currently performing scheduled maintenance and updates on the website.""Volusion provides shopping cart software to thousands of merchants, and according to Mr Afrahim has had 185 million orders placed via its software, amounting to $28bn in transactions.Two other security researchers, from Trend Micro and RiskIQ, also confirmed the issue to ZDNet, which was first to report the incident."
technology	Microsoft's GitHub blocks Catalan protest app	From hosting to protests'Sabotage'	"Microsoft-owned GitHub has blocked Spanish users from accessing an app designed to help Catalan independence protesters.It follows a takedown request by the Spanish military police.Authorities described the Tsunami Democràtic group, which is behind the app, as a ""criminal organisation"" which incites riots.GitHub said it always complied with lawful requests.A spokesman said: ""Although we may not always agree with those laws, we may need to block content if we receive a valid request from a government official so that our users in that jurisdiction may continue to have access to GitHub to collaborate and build software.""GitHub has received takedown requests from China and Russia, related to different posts.San Francisco-based GitHub provides hosting for software developers and allows coders to collaborate with each other.It was bought by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5bn (£5.8bn).Tsunami Democràtic used GitHub to develop tools to co-ordinate protest action, including an encrypted communication app.The group helped to organise pro-independence rallies at Barcelona airport, which saw dozens of flights cancelled.Protestors demonstrating against the imprisonment of nine Catalan separatist leaders have copied tactics devised by demonstrators in Hong Kong, including blocking airports and using encrypted messaging.This is not the first time a company has removed an app linked to protests.Earlier this month, Apple removed an app which protesters in Hong Kong used to track police movements, claiming it violated the company's rules.Tsunami Democràtic told TechCrunch that users of Apple's iPhone can't yet download the app because the ""politics of the App Store is very restrictive"".The app is currently only available as a raw Android file, and users cannot download it via the Google Play store either.The Spanish military police, or Guardia Civil, said protestors had engaged in ""sabotage"" of Spain's main infrastructure.GitHub's website says it follows a four-step process each time it receives a takedown request.This includes notifying affected users and giving them the chance to dispute any request.It also says it tries to ""limit the geographic scope of the takedown when possible"".Joe Brew, an independent data scientist, said the ban was likely to be ineffective.""Trying to ban these types of things is like a game of cat-and-mouse. The moment you succeed with a ban in one place, it pops up in ten other places."""

technology	US military draws up 'do not buy' list for software	Concealed code	"The US military is being warned off installing software believed to have been compromised by Russian or Chinese state-backed hackers.The Pentagon has drawn up a ""do not buy"" list of suppliers, reports the Defense One news site.Legitimate-looking software developers could be fronts for enemy hacker groups, it was told.The news follows official warnings about software supply-chain attacks that target widely used programs.The Pentagon started to draw up the list in early 2018 and it is regularly circulated to procurement chiefs and other teams who source software for the armed forces. No details of which software packages or developers are on the list have been released.In addition, contractors who work with the US military to provide technology-related services are being ""educated"" about companies that look suspicious.Speaking to Defense One, Ellen Lord, US defence undersecretary for acquisition, would not be drawn on whether any weapons or projects run by the US military had been infiltrated by compromised software.Rather than concentrating on individual programs or weapon systems, she said, the Pentagon was concerned with the broader issue of finding and using trustworthy code.Attempts to subvert code could take several different forms, suggested a report by the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center. It could involve:Russia had consistently denied any involvement in cyber-espionage, said Vitaliy Shevchenko, from BBC Monitoring. Russia has said sanctions visited on companies such as its homegrown cyber-security company Kaspersky Lab were simply examples of American unfair competitive practices.Mr Shevchenko said Russia's information strategy regarded imported software as a threat in the same way the Pentagon did. However, he added, it was not clear how much success it had in swapping suspect code for native alternatives.The ""do not buy"" list comes after several warnings over software and equipment already widely used in the US and UK.Telecoms hardware and code from Huawei and ZTE have been subjected to intense scrutiny in recent months. Earlier this month, a UK government report said it had ""only limited assurance"" that Huawei's kit posed no threat to national security."
technology	Microsoft issues emergency patch for Explorer browser		Microsoft has released an emergency update for its Internet Explorer browser to fix a bug that cyber-thieves are known to be exploiting.The bug could let attackers hijack a web browser and use their access to install malware, it warned.Attackers are believed to have built booby-trapped webpages harbouring malicious code that infects visitors.In a description of the problem, Microsoft said versions nine to 11 were vulnerable.Anyone regularly using Internet Explorer is being urged to download and apply the patch.Typically, Microsoft releases patches for software bugs in its monthly update.However, the severity of the problem and the fact that it was being abused led it to issue a rare emergency patch.Statistics suggest just over 8% of people are still using Internet Explorer.Use of the browser has declined as Microsoft has sought to push people to use its Edge net software.The software problem was discovered by Google engineer Clement Lecigne who works on its threat analysis team.

You're not giving them a chance to consent, you are forcing the image on them, and that is never OK.""To test and train the artificial intelligence system, Ms Bressler and her team set up a Twitter inbox where men were invited to ""send nudes for science"".So many volunteered their nude photos that the team has had to close the inbox.Initial tests showed the system was ""tricked"" by a man wearing a cage over his genitals.A photo of a penis covered in glitter was also missed by the software.However, Ms Bressler said the software was a ""huge success"" when it came to detecting ""vanilla"" penis photos and nudes.""I see the issue come up in my news feed almost daily, but Twitter has not yet shown they care enough to find a solution,"" Ms Bressler told the BBC.""If this tech could be created in a couple of days, I'm not sure why tech companies have not led similar initiatives.""People say the easy solution is to close your messages - but we should not have to shut ourselves off to the world because some people do not know how to behave.""Ms Bressler said the team was open to sharing its research with Twitter when the project was finished."
technology	Google finds 'indiscriminate iPhone attack lasting years'	'Sustained effort'Are you protected?Apple's fix	"Security researchers at Google have found evidence of a “sustained effort” to hack iPhones over a period of at least two years.The attack was said to be carried out using websites which would discreetly implant malicious software to gather contacts, images and other data.Google’s analysis suggested the booby-trapped websites were said to have been visited thousands of times per week.Apple told the BBC it did not wish to comment.The attack was shared in great detail in a series of technical posts written by British cybersecurity expert Ian Beer, a member of Project Zero, Google’s taskforce for finding new security vulnerabilities, known as zero days.""There was no target discrimination,” Mr Beer wrote.“Simply visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant.""Mr Beer and his team said they discovered attackers were using 12 separate security flaws in order to compromise devices. Most were bugs within Safari, the default web browser on Apple products.Once on a person’s iPhone, the implant could access an enormous amount of data, including (though not limited to) contacts, images and GPS location data. It would relay this information back to an external server every 60 seconds, Mr Beer noted.The implant also was able to scoop up data from apps a person was using, such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram. Mr Beer’s list of examples also included Google products such as Gmail and Hangouts, the firm's group video chat app.The attackers were able to exploit ""almost every version from iOS 10 through to the latest version of iOS 12”, Mr Beer added.""This indicated a group making a sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years.”Apple issued a software fix to address the flaw back in February.If you are an iPhone user, you should make sure your device is running the latest version of iOS, to make sure you are protected.To do this, go to Settings and tap General. Under 'Software Update' you should be running iOS 12.4.1.If you are not running iOS 12.4.1 you will be given the opportunity to update your device.Google’s team notified Apple of the vulnerabilities on 1 February this year. A patch was subsequently released six days later to close the vulnerability. Apple’s patch notes refer to fixing an issue whereby “an application may be able to gain elevated privileges” and “an application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges”.iPhone users should update their device to the latest software to make sure they are adequately protected.Unlike some security disclosures, which offer merely theoretical uses of vulnerabilities, Google discovered this attack “in the wild"" - in other words, it was in use by cybercriminals.Mr Beer’s analysis did not speculate on who may be behind the attack, nor how lucrative the tool may have been on the black market. Some “zero day” attacks can be sold for several millions dollars - until they’re discovered and fixed._____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

technology	Alert over booby-trapped security software	Cleaning up	"A security company has issued a warning after its software was compromised by malicious hackers.Piriform told users a booby-trapped version of its CCleaner software had been made available in August and September.Millions of people use the CCleaner program to remove unwanted junk from Android phones and Windows PCs.Piriform's owner, Avast, said it had managed to remove the compromised version before any harm had been done.It appears that it was only the Windows version of CCleaner that was compromised.If the malicious hackers who had managed to subvert the software had not been spotted, they could have remotely taken over the devices of the 2.27 million people who had downloaded version 5.33 of the program, said Paul Yung, from Piriform.Mr Yung said the company had spotted some ""suspicious activity"" on 12 September that led it to discover version 5.33 had been ""illegally modified"" before it had been made available to the public.The modified version was available for about a month.The modifications made infected machines contact some recently registered web domains - a tactic often used by cyber-thieves who then use this route to install more damaging software on compromised devices.The impact of the infection had been limited, said Mr Yung, because relatively few people automatically updated the CCleaner software.Anyone who had downloaded the compromised version of CCleaner was now being moved to the latest uninfected version, he said.""To the best of our knowledge, we were able to disarm the threat before it was able to do any harm,"" said Mr Yung.He apologised for any inconvenience that had been caused and said the company's investigation into the attack was ""ongoing"".Separate analysis by Cisco's Talos security group suggests whoever was behind the attack on CCleaner had managed to get access to the server Piriform used to host new versions of the software.Talos researcher Craig Williams told the Reuters news agency the attack had been ""sophisticated"" because it had targeted a trusted server and sought to make the booby-trapped version look legitimate.""There is nothing a user could have noticed,"" he said."
technology	Hijacked software used to target tech giants	Cleaning up	"Hackers who booby-trapped widely used security software also used their malware to infiltrate machines at tech firms, suggests analysis.Evidence that other companies had been compromised came to light as Cisco researchers probed how attackers got at the popular CCleaner programme.Millions of people downloaded a Windows version that hackers had laced with malicious code.Cisco said the attackers were seeking valuable intellectual property.Last week CCleaner creator Piriform revealed that attackers had managed to place a hijacked copy of version 5.33 that works on Windows on some download servers. The booby-trapped code was available for about a month between August and September,Millions of people downloaded the compromised version of CCleaner but damage was limited because whoever created it had not updated it to include elements that could scan machines and steal data.However, Cisco said its analysis suggested that attackers had taken that extra step on machines at tech firms they had managed to infiltrate.Hi-tech giants including Cisco, Intel, Google, Samsung and Microsoft were among the 20 or so companies believed to have been hit in this way.""These new findings raise our level of concern about these events, as elements of our research point towards a possible unknown, sophisticated actor,"" wrote the Cisco researchers.Cisco said it was likely that a lot of other firms had been hit by whoever was behind the sophisticated and wide-ranging attack.It recommended that anyone cleaning up after finding they had been compromised restore machines from backup as it was not clear what other code the attackers had installed on those computers. It said it was still analysing the code to find out exactly what it did.Cisco said it was not yet clear who carried out the sophisticated attack on CCleaner and the other technology firms."
technology	Uber's paradox: Gig work app traps and frees its drivers	Minimum wageData v anecdotes'Prison and liberator'	"On 24 November, after a nervous wait, Uber will learn whether its licence to operate in London is to be renewed.The impending decision has revived debate over whether the data-driven basis for its business model and the ""gig economy"" jobs it creates are fair.A wave of platforms has followed, offering new ways to buy and sell, to rent from and temporarily hire others.Rather than salaried employees, independent contractors are paid by consumers for a specific job - a ""gig"".The platforms in the middle argue they do not employ staff but simply connect customers with people seeking to make money.Research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) estimates that one in 10 workers in the UK now regularly does ""platform work"".No company is more symbolic of this shift than Uber itself.As a consequence, it has become a lightning rod for arguments about what gig work really represents.Does it usher in new, flexible, liberating ways to work, or is it the means for a kind of arms-length control that undermines basic rights?Abdura Hadi, an Uber driver who has worked on the streets of London for five years, has noticed a change.""On average, I used to work six-to-eight hours, six days a week to provide for my family"" he told me. Now, he adds: ""It's 10-to-12 hours.""He's noticed that over the period, the number of Uber drivers has rapidly increased, while the number of pick-up jobs has not kept up.Increased competition has made a particular part of Uber's platform critical to Mr Hadi and his fellow drivers' earning power - the software that determines who gets each ride.However, none of them knows how it works.""My family depends on the algorithm,"" he explains.""Sometimes it's scary, but if it was fair, it would be OK.""At the heart of the controversy around Uber is that the disruption it has brought isn't just economic, but also legal.Definitions that were once reasonably clear in the workplace have become muddied.The question of whether Uber drivers are actually employees is currently making its way through the British courts.Even one of the most basic facts of any job has become disputed: how much Uber drivers actually earn.""It's a fact that drivers are working on less than minimum wage,"" claims Mr Hadi.Yet a recent study co-authored by researchers at Oxford University and Uber, based on administrative data from the company, reported that the median London driver earns about £11 per hour spent logged into the app.That is just above the London Living Wage.The study included vehicle operation costs and time spent waiting between rides while logged in.Ken Jacobs, an academic at University of California, Berkeley, who has studied hidden costs that Uber drivers and other gig workers face, refers to them as the five ""major loopholes"".They include:""They tend to way underestimate the actual expenses a driver incurs,"" he said.Meera Joshi, the former head of the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission, the regulator responsible for services like Uber across the city, says data is key.""Without data you only have anecdotes,"" she told me.""You have stories from drivers about low wages, but you have no way to really quantify that.""In perhaps the first move of its kind, Ms Joshi's commission forced Uber to hand over data about its drivers operating in New York.""What we found out was that conditions were worse than what was described to us by drivers,"" she said.""Ninety-six per cent of drivers were making less than the city's minimum wage. Most of the drivers were providing the main source of income for their families.""After the watchdog implemented minimum-wage protections to cover the 80,000 New York drivers involved, an additional $225m (£172m) per month went ""back into the pockets of drivers"", said Ms Joshi.As a result, the cash flowed into local neighbourhoods rather than back to San Francisco-based Uber.The Oxford paper also claimed that Uber drivers had higher levels of life satisfaction than other workers, but also higher anxiety levels.""That's the paradox of Uber,"" commented Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation.""It is both a prison and a liberator. You can just switch on the app and start working, but if you have a family to support, it's obviously less flexible. You need to match peaks of demand: rush hours and weekends.""And Uber is just the ""tip of the iceberg"", he added.""The majority of gig-economy workers are women, doing care, cleaning.""Under the water level, you have platforms openly advertising rates beneath minimum wage.""Uber has taken steps to benefit the drivers ahead of the licensing deadline. For example, last week it added a button to their app to let them report racism or other discriminatory behaviour from passengers, who it promises to kick off its platform if the complaint is upheld.""Drivers are at the heart of our service - we can't succeed without them - and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road,"" it said in a statement.""Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.""But in many ways, the gig economy simply reintroduces very old issues of conditions and rights in the workplace in new ways.Previous decades saw the struggles of employees to have their rights recognised; now the struggle is one of workers to be recognised as employees at all.Once the focus was on the power of the owners of the means of production; now it is on the owners of the means to find work via the net.The new battleground is not over who controls the shop floor, but who controls the data involved. Who has it, and what it reveals.Whatever happens on 24 November, the wider debate will continue for a long time yet."
technology	Israeli spies 'watched Russian agents breach Kaspersky software'	Integrity 'fundamental'	"Israeli spies looked on as Russian hackers breached Kaspersky cyber-security software two years ago, US media report.The Russians were allegedly attempting to gather data on US intelligence programs, according to the New York Times and Washington Post.Israeli agents made the discovery after breaching the software themselves.Kaspersky has said it was neither involved in nor aware of the situation and denies collusion with authorities.Last month, the US government decided to stop using the Russian firm's software on its computers.The Israelis are said to have notified the US, which led to the ban on Kaspersky programs.The New York Times said that the situation had been described by ""multiple people who have been briefed on the matter"".Classified documents are reported to have been stolen from the home computer of a US National Security Agency (NSA) employee who installed Kaspersky's antivirus software.The NSA, the White House and the Israeli embassy in Washington have not commented on the matter.The New York Times said that the Russian embassy had not responded to a request for comment.Kaspersky has published a statement saying that it was not involved in and does not have knowledge of the situation.""As the integrity of our products is fundamental to our business, Kaspersky Lab patches any vulnerabilities it identifies or that are reported to the company,"" the statement said.""Kaspersky Lab reiterates its willingness to work alongside US authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems, and respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.""The firm added that it has never helped, nor would help, governments in matters of cyber-espionage."
technology	Emojis help software spot emotion and sarcasm		"Emoji icons have helped scientists train computers to understand sarcasm.Researchers used 1.2 billion tweets containing at least one of the most popular 64 emojis to develop DeepMoji.The algorithm learned first to predict which emoji was likely to be used and then to recognise sarcasm, allowing it to spot hate speech faster than humans.It could also be used to assess how people really feel about different brands or to improve human interaction with smart programs such as chatbots.""Because we can't use intonation in our voice or body language to contextualise what we are saying, emojis are the way we do it online,"" Prof Iyad Rahwan told MIT's Technology Review magazine.Prof Iyad Rahwan and graduate student Bjarke Felbo have created a website inviting people to refine DeepMoji's education by submitting and annotating their own messages.The pair also plan to release the algorithm's code so it can be used by other researchers.""Using emojis as labels for training neural networks is a great idea,"" said Prof Kerstin Dautenhahn who studies human-machine interaction at the University of Hertfordshire.""Applying it to tweets seems also a smart choice, since communication via tweets is much more impoverished than actual face-to-face conversation,"" she said, ""so chances are better for the algorithms to work.""Prof Dautenhahn raised doubts about the wide range of human activity that was now being monitored and analysed to try to guess what people think and feel.""Are we happy with more and more detailed profiles of us being created?"" she asked."
technology	Tax software blamed for cyber-attack spread	Automatic updatesPossible channelNightmare scenarioHow does the new ransomware spread?	"A global cyber-attack that affected companies around the world may have started via corrupted updates on a piece of accountancy software.Fingers are increasingly pointing to a piece of Ukrainian tax-filing software, MEDoc, as the source of the infection, although the company denies it.Malware generally infiltrates networks via email attachments that users click on in error.Microsoft described the method as ""a recent dangerous trend"".The cyber-attack has caused disruption around the world and infected companies in 64 countries, including banks in Ukraine, Russian oil giant Rosneft, British advertising company WPP and US law firm DLA Piper.Shipping giant Maersk said it was unable to process new orders and was expecting delays to consignments, while one of Europe's largest port operators in Rotterdam said that it had to use manual processes, and Dutch global parcel service TNT said it was operating with restrictions.A Cadbury's factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt when computer systems went down, according to Australian Manufacturing and Workers Union state secretary John Short.Ukraine was hit hardest, suggesting the attack might be politically motivated.According to anti-virus vendor ESET, 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany second hardest hit with about 9%.A growing number of security experts, including the British malware expert Marcus Hutchins - credited with ending the WannaCry ransomware outbreak - claim to have logs that reveal MEDoc as the source.In email correspondence with the BBC, Mr Hutchins said: ""It looks like the software's automatic update system was compromised and used to download and run malware rather than updates for the software.""It was not yet clear how it had been compromised, he added.MEDoc has denied the claims, in a Facebook post - but in a blog post analysing how the infection had taken hold on Windows machines, Microsoft also points the finger at the accounting software.""Active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc update process,"" it writes.Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey, said: The ironic thing about this situation (if it proves to be the case) is that we always advise users to keep their software up to date, ideally using automated updates.""However, it assumes hackers can't take over the update process and misuse it.""This process is normally a very tightly controlled process, so this is unusual.""I can imagine many vendors are now triple-checking to make sure they don't end up being an attack vector.""He said that it showed ""hackers will probe every possible channel"" to find a route into systems.""As users there isn't a lot we can do as we are in the hands of the software vendors.""As to how the infection spread beyond Ukraine, he added: ""I wouldn't mind betting that a lot of these multinationals such as Maersk and Merck had this software installed.""Mikko Hypponen, a security expert at F-Secure, has studied the recruitment pages of many of the companies affected and found that some did indeed use the MeDoc software.""If you do business in Ukraine, the software appears to be de facto,"" he said.There were other anomalies in the attack that pointed to it having been targeted, said Prof Woodward.""The software was sophisticated, but the attackers only provided one single email address and that was closed down very quickly so it is difficult not to conclude that this wasn't about money but targeted at Ukraine or those doing business with it,"" he said.A Kremlin spokesman said that the malware attack had caused no serious damage in Russia.""Protection systems have been quite effective both at state and corporate levels,"" said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.He added that the origin of the attack remained unclear.Most security experts agree that the virus, thought to be a new variant of the Petya ransomware, was spread using a Windows vulnerability known as Eternal Blue, discovered by the National Security Agency and leaked online.Mr Hypponen told the BBC that it was ""completely clear"" that hackers in both WannaCry and Petya outbreaks had used the NSA exploit.The fact that it had now been leaked and was being used by criminal or political hackers was ""a nightmare scenario"" for the intelligence agency, he said.""It chose to use the exploit, not tell Microsoft about it and weaponise it, and now it has been leaked, made public and used in an attack,"" he said.The NSA has not publicly acknowledged that its tools have been used in any hacking attacks, but it has not denied it either.Typically ransomware spreads via email, with the aim of fooling recipients into clicking on malware-laden files that cause a PC's data to become scrambled before making a blackmail demand.But other ransomware, including Wannacry, has also spread via ""worms"" - self-replicating programs that spread from computer to computer hunting for vulnerabilities they can exploit.The current attack is thought to have worm-like properties.Several experts believe that one way it breaches companies' cyber-defences is by hijacking an automatic software updating tool used to upgrade an tax accountancy program.Once it has breached an organisation, it uses a variety of means to spread internally to other computers on the same network.One of these is via the so-called EternalBlue hack - an exploit thought to have been developed by US cyberspies, which takes advantage of a weakness in a protocol used to let computers and other equipment talk to each other, known as the Server Message Block (SMB).Another is to steal IT staffs' credentials and then make use of two administrative tools: PsExec, a program that allows software installations and other tasks to be carried out remotely; and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) a program that allows PCs to be controlled by typing in commands rather than via a graphical-interface.Once a PC is infected, the malware targets a part of its operating system called the Master File Table (MFT).It is essential for the system to know where to find files on the computer.The advantage of doing this rather than trying to encrypt everything on the PC is the task can be achieved much more quickly.Then between 10 to 60 minutes later, the malware forces a reboot of the computer, which then informs the user it is locked and requires a payment for them to get a decryption key."
technology	Ubuntu ends Unity software unification project	Market reality	"Open source software platform Ubuntu has ended an ambitious six-year project called Unity that aimed to unify the way that people used its products.Work has also ended on versions of its software that was designed to run on smartphones and laptops.Ubuntu said it took the decision because the project had failed to win over users and industry partners.Instead, it said, it would concentrate on code for cloud services and internet-of-things devices.The Linux open source operating system exists in lots of different versions or ""distributions"" that share the same source code but often have a different interface laid on top. Unity aimed to be a graphical front-end suitable for lots of different devices.Canonical, which makes the popular Ubuntu distribution of the Linux open source software, started the Unity project in 2011. The ultimate idea was to produce software that ran on large and small devices and could be used the same way on all of them.The Unity project also aimed to let smartphones act as a desktop machine when combined with other devices such as docking stations.However, said Canonical boss Mark Shuttleworth in a blog, although Unity tried to end some of the fragmentation in the open source world it actually ended up contributing to it.In addition, he said, few people had bought phones or laptops that ran the Ubuntu/Unity combination and few laptop makers were offering the software as an option.Mr Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu would switch back to the default user interface for Linux - known as Gnome - in April 2018.He said the decision to end Unity had been ""very difficult"" because he believed strongly in ways to make it easier to use Linux anywhere and everywhere and because of the time he had spent with the developers working on it.""We feel like a family, but this choice is shaped by commercial constraints and those two are hard to reconcile,"" he said."
technology	Ukraine cyber-attack: Software firm MeDoc's servers seized		"Police in Ukraine have seized the servers of an accountancy software firm, which is believed to have unwittingly helped spread malware that attacked many global firms last month.Intellect Service has denied that its software helped spread the malware.But security experts have said that some of the initial infections were indeed spread via a malicious update to MeDoc.It is Ukraine's most popular accounting software.The cyber-attack - a variant of an earlier virus called Petya - hit businesses around the world including the shipping firm Maersk and the marketing giant WPP.It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack designed to make money for the hackers behind it.But some security firms now think that it was deliberately designed to destroy data and targeted Ukraine.The head of the country's national Cyberpolice unit had previously alleged that Intellect Service had ignored repeated warnings that it needed to improve its security in advance of the attack.""They were told many times by various anti-virus firms,"" Col Serhiy Demydiuk told the Associated Press news agency.""For this neglect, the people in this case will face criminal responsibility.""In a separate interview with Reuters, the father and daughter team who run Intellect Service said they were not responsible.""What has been established in these days, when no one slept and only worked? We studied and analysed our product for signs of hacking - it is not infected with a virus and everything is fine, it is safe,"" said Olesya Linnik, managing partner at Intellect Service.""The update package, which was sent out long before the virus was spread, we checked it 100 times and everything is fine.""Security experts, including Microsoft, Cisco and Symantec, said that they all have evidence that the malware was spread via an update to the tax software program MeDoc.It is believed that around 80% of companies in Ukraine use the software, which allows clients to send and discuss financial documents internally as well as file them with the government's tax department.Ukraine police said that the family could face criminal charges if it is confirmed that they knew about the infection but took no action."
technology	Google sign language AI turns hand gestures into speech	Hidden fingers	"Google has developed software that could pave the way for smartphones to interpret sign language.The tech firm has not made a product of its own but has published algorithms which it hopes developers will use to make their own apps.Until now, this type of software has only worked on PCs.But campaigners from the hearing-impaired community have welcomed the move, but say the tech might struggle to fully grasp some conversations.In an AI blog, Google research engineers Valentin Bazarevsky and Fan Zhang said the intention of the freely published hand-tracking technology - which can perceive the shape and motion of hands - was to serve as ""the basis for sign language understanding"".""We're excited to see what people come up with. For our part, we will continue our research to make the technology more robust and to stabilise tracking, increasing the number of gestures we can reliably detect,"" a spokeswoman for Google told the BBC.Google acknowledges this is a first step. Campaigners say an app that produced audio from hand signals alone would miss any facial expressions or speed of signing and these can change the meaning of what is being discussed.Also, any regionalisms which exist in a local area would not be included.Jesal Vishnuram, Action on Hearing Loss's technology manager, says the initiative is a good first step for hearing people, but that it needs to be paired with other capabilities.""From a deaf person's perspective, it'd be more beneficial for software to be developed which could provide automated translations of text or audio into British Sign Language (BSL) to help everyday conversations and reduce isolation in the hearing world,"" he said.Until now, when trying to track hands on video, finger-bending and flicks of the wrist have hidden other parts of the hand. This confused earlier versions of this kind of software.Google imposes a graph on 21 points across the fingers, palm and back of the hand, making it easier to understand a hand signal if the hand and arm twist or two fingers touch.Other large US software providers have developed technologies that have attempted to read aloud sign language on PCs.Last year, Microsoft teamed up with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf to use desktop computers in classrooms that helped students with hearing disabilities via a presentation translator.In a blog, students described having previously missed some of what their professors had said because they had to keep switching attention from human sign language interpreters to what was being written on the board.But by having all the viewing information presented via a desktop, the problem was solved.Elsewhere in the world, innovators have created their own home-grown tech.One 25-year-old developer in Kenya has built a pair of haptic gloves that translate sign language to an Android application which reads the text aloud.Roy Allela made the gloves for his hearing-impaired niece, and his innovation recently won an award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers."

However, reports have suggested some screen protectors are incompatible with the reader because they leave a small air gap that interferes with the scanning.Samsung has said it is ""aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch"".Banks understand a fix will be rolled out this week, but on Thursday the South Korean firm was unable to confirm when that might happen."

In one example, Rey Mysterio's mask dissolved into his face.Another mistake shared on social media showed WWE Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch with disembodied facial features.Another visual error, which might be more at home in a horror film, shows a wrestler suffering from an extremely lazy eye.Fans have also directed criticism at gameplay bugs, which they say are so severe that they leave players with no choice but to quit the game.Videos of the problems show characters being crushed and sinking inside the wrestling ring.One video of Charlotte Flair being flung in circles around Sasha Banks has been viewed more than 700,000 times on Twitter.Another post shows wrestlers Alexa Bliss, Carmella and Kairi Sane bouncing violently against the ropes and canvas, as the referee is literally absorbed into the ring.2K Sports, which makes the game, has not yet replied to a BBC request for comment.Meanwhile, some fans who purchased a special edition of the game have voiced their frustration at it not including a promised autograph from a WWE legend.The WWE 2K20 Collector's Edition is priced at £139.99 and according to retailer Game ""includes a collectible acrylic piece containing one of three possible WWE SmackDown Legend Autographs"".But some fans said their ""collectible acrylic piece"" was missing a signature.2K Games has advised fans to get in touch to resolve the problem. But WWE legend Edge has taken things further.The former wrestler tweeted a guarantee that he will send a private message on Twitter to anyone missing his autograph, and arrange to send them a replacement."
technology	Microsoft briefly disables anti-virus software for Windows 10	Detection ratesTemporarily disabled	"Microsoft has admitted that it does temporarily disable anti-virus software on Windows PCs, following a competition complaint to the European Commission by a security company.In early June, Kaspersky Lab filed the complaint against Microsoft.The security company claims the software giant is abusing its market dominance by steering users to its own anti-virus software.Microsoft says it implemented defences to keep Windows 10 users secure.In an extensive blog post that does not directly address Kaspersky or its claims, Microsoft says it bundles the Windows Defender Antivirus with Windows 10 to ensure that every single device is protected from viruses and malware.""We built Windows Defender Antivirus to make a promise to our customers that every Windows 10 device always has protection from viruses and malware... our test results are among the top of security industry leaders, including recent real-world testing where Windows Defender Antivirus scored over 99% detection rates,"" writes Rob Lefferts, a partner director of the Windows and Devices group in enterprise and security at Microsoft.""We also know that Window customers value choice, and that is why we actively engage with and support a community of over 80 independent software vendors through the Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) program.""This engineering programme enables us to share key technical details of Microsoft technologies with our AV [anti-virus] partners to collaborate on future directions and problem solve on existing security challenges to protect our shared customers from malicious software.""To combat the 300,000 new malware samples being created and spread every day, Microsoft says that it works together with external anti-virus partners.The technology giant estimates that about 95% of Windows 10 PCs were using anti-virus software that was already compatible with the latest Windows 10 Creators Update.For the applications that were not compatible, Microsoft built a feature that lets users update their PCs and then reinstall a new version of the anti-virus software.""To do this, we first temporarily disabled some parts of the AV software when the update began. We did this work in partnership with the AV partner to specify which versions of their software are compatible and where to direct customers after updating,"" Mr Lefferts writes."
technology	Police officers raise concerns about 'biased' AI data	'Self-fulfilling prophecy''Patchwork quilt'	"Police officers have raised concerns about using ""biased"" artificial-intelligence tools, a report commissioned by one of the UK government's advisory bodies reveals.The study warns such software may ""amplify"" prejudices, meaning some groups could become more likely to be stopped in the street and searched.It says officers also worry they could become over-reliant on automation.And it says clearer guidelines are needed for facial recognition's use.""The police are concerned that the lack of clear guidance could lead to uncertainty over acceptable uses of this technology,"" the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi)'s Alexander Babuta told BBC News.""And given the lack of any government policy for police use of data analytics, it means that police forces are going to be reluctant to innovate.""That means any potential benefits of these technologies may be lost because police forces' risk aversion may lead them not to try to develop or implement these tools for fear of legal repercussions.""Rusi interviewed about 50 experts for its study, including senior police officers in England and Wales - who were not named - as well as legal experts, academics and government officials.The work was commissioned by the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, which plans to draw up a code of practice covering the police's use of data analytics next year.One of the key concerns expressed was about using existing police records to train machine-learning tools, since these might be skewed by the arresting officers' own prejudices.""Young black men are more likely to be stopped and searched than young white men, and that's purely down to human bias,"" said one officer.""That human bias is then introduced into the datasets and bias is then generated in the outcomes of the application of those datasets.""An added factor, the report said, was people from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to use public services frequently. And this would generate more data about them, which in turn could make them more likely to be flagged as a risk.Matters could worsen over time, another officer said, when software was used to predict future crime hotspots.""We pile loads of resources into a certain area and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, purely because there's more policing going into that area, not necessarily because of discrimination on the part of officers,"" the interviewee said.There was disagreement, however, on how much scope should be given to officers wanting to ignore predictive software's recommendations.""Officers often disagree with the algorithm,"" said one.""I'd expect and welcome that challenge. The point where you don't get that challenge, that's when people are putting that professional judgement aside.""But another officer worried about others being too willing to ignore an app's recommendations, adding: ""Professional judgement might just be another word for bias.""Mr Babuta said this problem could be addressed.""There are ways that you can scan and analyse the data for bias and then eliminate it,"" he told BBC News.""[And] there are police forces that are exploring the opportunities of these new types of data analytics for actually eliminating bias in their own data sets.""But he added that ""we need clearer processes to ensure that those safeguards are applied consistently"".In the meantime, one officer described the current landscape as being like ""a patchwork quilt - uncoordinated and delivered to different settings and for different outcomes"".The National Police Chiefs' Council has responded saying UK police always seek to strike a balance between keeping people safe and protecting their rights.""For many years police forces have looked to be innovative in their use of technology to protect the public and prevent harm and we continue to explore new approaches to achieve these aims,"" Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Drake said.""But our values mean we police by consent, so anytime we use new technology we consult with interested parties to ensure any new tactics are fair, ethical and producing the best results for the public."""
technology	Ransomware 'stopped' by new software		"Scientists at the University of Florida (UF) say they have developed software that can stop the growing problem of ransomware in its tracks.Ransomware encrypts computer files and is used by hackers who then demand money in exchange for freeing the content.It is becoming a huge problem globally.The solution - dubbed CryptoDrop - detected the malware and stopped it after it had encrypted just a handful of files, said its developers.Patrick Traynor, an associate professor in UF's department of computer and information science, worked with PhD student Nolen Scaife and Henry Carter, from Villanova University, on the software.""Our system is more of an early-warning system,"" Mr Scaife said.""It doesn't prevent the ransomware from starting... it prevents the ransomware from completing its task… so you lose only a couple of pictures or a couple of documents rather than everything that's on your hard drive, and it relieves you of the burden of having to pay the ransom.""In tests, CryptoDrop had spotted 100% of malware samples and stopped it after an average of 10 files had been encrypted, researchers said.In May, the FBI issued a warning saying that the number of ransomware attacks had doubled in the past year and was expected to grow even more rapidly this year.It said that it had received more than 2,400 complaints last year and estimated losses from such attacks at $24m (£18m) for individuals and businesses.Governments, large companies, banks, hospitals and educational institutions are all among the victims of such attacks.Richard Cassidy, an expert at security firm Alert Logic said of CryptoDrop: ""Whilst the step taken by researchers at the University of Florida are indeed a novel way in which to detect and contain ransomware, it doesn't serve as the 'silver bullet' for ransomware as a whole.""""There are new variants being written all the time and ransomware writers will indeed take the time to dissect and understand how this new technology operates, creating versions that will attempt to either bypass detection, or at the very least search more effectively for likely sensitive files, before encrypting them, with the hope of having the biggest impact of securing a ransom payment.""The team at UF currently has a prototype that works with Windows-based systems.It is seeking a commercial partner for the software, having recently presented its paper on the technology at a conference in Japan."

Feeling naggedRunning concerns	"Microsoft has been criticised over its Windows 10 software by consumer rights group Which?.The body said it had received hundreds of complaints about the upgrade, including lost files, emails no longer syncing and broken wi-fi and printing.In some cases, it said, users had had to pay for their computer to be repaired.Microsoft defended its software and highlighted that it provided help online and by phone.""The Windows 10 upgrade is a choice designed to help people take advantage of the most secure and most productive Windows,"" said a spokesman.""Customers have distinct options. Should a customer need help with the upgrade experience, we have numerous options including free customer support.""Which? surveyed more than 5,500 of its members in June, and said that 12% of the 2,500 who had upgraded to Windows 10 had later reverted to an earlier version.The charity said users had complained of feeling ""nagged"" by regular alerts prompting them to upgrade their system, and, despite declining the notifications, had said Windows 10 had installed itself regardless.""Once installed, people reported various problems, including printers, wi-fi cards and speakers no longer working with their PC; instances of lost files and email accounts no longer syncing; and, most significantly, their computer encountering such problems that they had to pay someone to repair it,"" Which? said.""There have also been complaints about poor customer service from Microsoft when users contacted the company about the problems they are having.""Alex Neill, Which? director of campaigns and policy, added: ""We rely heavily on our computers to carry out daily activities, so, when they stop working, it is frustrating and stressful.""Many people are having issues with Windows 10, and we believe Microsoft should be doing more to fix the problem.""Windows 10 was released in July 2015 as a free upgrade for one year, and was designed to run across laptops, desktop computers, smartphones and Microsoft's augmented reality headset HoloLens.Last month, millions of webcams were rendered useless after an update to Windows 10.A Microsoft camera engineer who responded to complaints on the support thread at the time acknowledged the company had done ""a poor job"" of letting people know about the change.In July, the French data authority said Windows 10 gathered an ""excessive"" amount of personal data about users.By default, the software collects information on how it is used - including installed apps and how much time is spent using them.""[Microsoft] is collecting excessive data, as these data are not necessary for the operation of the service,"" said the National Data Protection Commission.Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: ""With a rollout of this size, it is always likely there will be issues and problems experienced by some users.""On the whole, Windows 10 has been received well, and was a notable step up from the previous Windows 8, which did not go down well with many users."""
technology	Tesla updates software after car hack	Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco	Tesla has updated its software after researchers from China hacked into the operating system of its electric cars.The team from Keen Security Lab remotely manipulated the brake system on a Tesla while it was on the move, from a distance of 12 miles (19km).Using a laptop, the hackers also managed to open a car door without using a key.Tesla has updated its software to prevent anyone else from manipulating its cars.The hack took place after months of research and the team from Keen Security Lab posted a video of their efforts earlier this week on YouTube.During the experiment a hacker took control of a vehicle from the passenger seat, while someone else was behind the wheel.Using a laptop, he was able to adjust the rear-view mirror while the driver was changing lanes. The hacker also managed to open the trunk remotely, while the car was on the move.This hack is notable for two reasons.One, it was conducted far away - as far as 12 miles, researchers said. And two, the sheer amount of control it can wrest from the driver is remarkable - brakes, windscreen wipers, all sorts.The good news is the security community is so far rising to the challenge of protecting cars from hackers. This hack was discovered by researchers who, as they should, went straight to Tesla before going public.Tesla's cars are able to get over-the-air updates, meaning Tesla's engineers can automatically rectify the vulnerability in its cars without drivers needing to visit a dealership.And that's precisely what the company has done.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook
technology	'Fatal' flaws found in medical implant software	'Malicious messages'	"Security flaws found in 10 different types of medical implants could have ""fatal"" consequences, warn researchers.The flaws were found in the radio-based communications used to update implants, including pacemakers, and read data from them.By exploiting the flaws, the researchers were able to adjust settings and even switch off gadgets.The attacks were also able to steal confidential data about patients and their health history.A software patch has been created to help thwart any real-world attacks.The flaws were found by an international team of security researchers based at the University of Leuven in Belgium and the University of Birmingham.While most implants work autonomously, many now use short-range wireless communications systems to make it easy for medical staff to retrieve data about the person the gadget is helping.Commands to change the way the devices function can also be sent wirelessly to ensure they are tuned to match an individual's physiology and condition.The team reverse-engineered the proprietary wireless signalling systems used by the implants which revealed flaws in the way data was broadcast. The attacks only worked when the researchers' eavesdropping equipment was within five metres of the devices.By eavesdropping on the data traffic, the researchers were able to pick out and replay commands that controlled the devices.Via this technique, attackers could find out ""sensitive information"" or send ""malicious messages"", said the team in a paper detailing its work.""The consequences of these attacks can be fatal for patients as these messages can contain commands to deliver a shock or to disable a therapy,"" it warned.All the implants were made by one company and all are currently being used widely, it said.The name of the implant maker was not disclosed but the security experts said they had told it about their findings. This had prompted it to update device software to help limit the potential danger to patients.""This shows that security must urgently improve,"" cardiologist Rik Willems, from the University of Leuven, who helped with the study told the Belgian newspaper Dr Tijd."

To remain compliant with this order, Adobe is deactivating all accounts in Venezuela.""It said it had no idea how long the sanctions would be in effect but added: ""We will continue to monitor developments closely and will make every effort to restore services to Venezuela as soon as it is legally permissible to do so.""It said it ""was unable to issue refunds"" because the sanctions included ""sales, service, support, refunds, credits, etc"".Adobe has moved to a subscription-only model for the latest versions of its products meaning users will not be able to buy standalone versions.One human rights advocate in the region, Geoff Ramsey, tweeted: ""Incredibly counterproductive. Any civil society NGO [non-governmental organisation] or independent media outlet that relies on registered copies of Photoshop, InDesign or Acrobat will be impacted.""The sanctions announced by President Trump freeze all Venezuelan government assets in the US and bar transactions with it. They are similar to sanctions imposed on North Korea, Iran and Cuba.The US is one of more than 50 nations that do not recognise Mr Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president.But there has been criticism of the US sanctions.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, said the sanctions were extremely broad and would hit the most vulnerable sections of society."

technology	Amazon Fire TVs to be sold by Currys PC World in UK		"Fire TV-branded 4K TV sets will be sold on the UK high street by Currys PC World, it has been revealed.The sets, made by manufacturer JVC, will be powered by Amazon's smart TV software.They will start at £349 and will also be available to buy online, on Amazon's own website.One industry commentator said it was a ""significant"" move, because video-streaming was increasingly being associated with hardware products.News of the partnership between the retailers was first published on a now-deleted page at tech site TechCrunch. However, the news has since appeared online elsewhere.Amazon's Fire TV software includes digital channels, video-streaming services, apps and skills for the Alexa smart speaker.""It is significant,"" said Andy Clough at What Hi-Fi. ""Obviously Amazon has made big inroads into the TV and video market with Amazon Prime, its streaming service.""Having hardware associated with that is a logical step,"" he told the BBC. ""I think it's very much a sign of the times.""The BBC has asked Amazon and Currys PC World for comment.The move could help Amazon's Prime Video service compete against Apple's iTunes Store and forthcoming TV subscription service. Both are made available via an app recently introduced to recent Samsung televisions.It also acts as an alternative to Google's Android TV service on Sony TVs, and LG's WebOS - both of which have media stores of their own.Amazon had previously announced Fire TV Edition televisions made by Toshiba for the US market.It is also expected to reveal further models made by Germany's Grundig at a press event this evening, ahead of the start of Berlin's Ifa tech expo.Dixons Carphone - the owner of the UK retail chain - already stocks other Amazon products including its Echo smart home speakers and Kindle ebook readers, as well as products from rival tech manufacturers."
technology	Microsoft releases Linux database software	'Significant threat'	"Microsoft has produced a version of its database software that runs on the rival Linux operating system.The version of SQL Server software it has made for Linux will be released in mid-2017, it said in a blogpost.The creation of the software is a significant step for Microsoft which has traditionally focused on its core Windows operating system.It is one of several steps it has taken to open up its software to rivals under boss Satya Nadella.Microsoft's SQL Server is one of the company's core products and the Windows version is used by many customers to run and manage databases.Scott Guthrie, head of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, said the Linux version was currently being previewed and tested by customers but would be fully available by the middle of next year. He said Renault's Formula 1 racing team was one of the first test customers for the code.Microsoft has about a 21% share of the database software market, suggest figures from analyst firm Gartner.Oracle is the market leader and the release of SQL Server for Linux will help Microsoft compete with that company, it said.Gartner analyst Merv Adrian told Reuters that the move made sense because although business spending on technology had been ""lacklustre"" the amount of cash firms spent to maintain and update database software had kept rising.Mr Adrian said Oracle would undoubtedly notice Microsoft's step into the Linux market.""It's a significant competitive threat they didn't have before,"" he said.The move also puts Microsoft into more direct competition with IBM and SAP. There are also a lot of free Linux-based database programs available.The release of SQL Server is one among several steps Microsoft has taken to work more closely with Linux and its advocates.The data centre management software Microsoft uses for its Azure service is based on Linux; it has also produced software that helps people manage Linux servers and has released an analytics package called R Server that works with several different versions of Linux.The greater willingness to work with former rivals has been one of the hallmarks of boss Satya Nadella's reign at Microsoft. Mr Nadella took over as chief executive in February 2014."
technology	Bangladesh hack 'targeted bank system software'	Transfer tool	"British defence contractor BAE Systems has claimed bank hackers in Bangladesh targeted software from Swift, a key part of the global financial system.According to a report from the Reuters news agency, BAE made the discovery after investigating the theft of $81 million (£56m) from the Bangladesh central bank in February.Swift has released a software update to assist customers with security.The group said its network and core messaging services were not affected.BAE has published a blog on its findings.The hackers were discovered - thanks to a spelling mistake in one transfer order - before they could transfer $1bn (£690m) as they had planned.A cheap internet router with no firewall has been blamed for the thieves being able to gain access to the Bangladesh bank's computers.Using this access, the thieves allegedly transferred funds from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into other bank accounts.Now, BAE says it believes part of the hack involved gaining access to the Bangladesh central bank's Swift payment system.Swift, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is used by 11,000 banks and other institutions.In its blog, BAE described some of the features of tools that it believes were used during the attack on the Bangladesh central bank.The blog adds: ""This malware appears to be just part of a wider attack toolkit and would have been used to cover the attackers' tracks as they sent forged payment instructions to make the transfers.""Such an approach would target Swift's Alliance Access software specifically.In a statement, Swift said: ""This malware has no impact on Swift's network or core messaging services.""We understand that the malware is designed to hide the traces of fraudulent payments from customers' local database applications and can only be installed on users' local systems by attackers that have successfully identified and exploited weaknesses in their local security.""Natasha Deteran, a spokeswoman for Swift, told Reuters the software update was intended ""to assist customers in enhancing their security and to spot inconsistencies in their local database records""."

If the problem persists, please restart your Kindle from the Menu in Settings and try again.""The only way the solve the problem, however, will be to plug the device into a computer and download the relevant update from the Amazon website.Amazon said that to install the update before 22 March, users should go to the Kindle home screen, choose Menu and select ""Sync and Check for Items"".The device will then update when asleep.The Kindles affected include:According to the Kindleworld blog, the update will not affect a user's reading experience.However, it said, a second update has been released which modifies the interface of more recent Kindles.""Some [users] are not enthralled with the new interface because it includes recommended books,"" iKindleworld said.""Some of us have always turned off the option to see Amazon recommendations, as we just want to see the books we bought and prefer to go to the Amazon pages if we want recommendations.""But users who do not want book recommendations can turn them off in their device settings by following instructions set out in an Amazon forum."
technology	US prisoners released early by software bug		"More than 3,200 US prisoners have been released early because of a software glitch.The bug miscalculated the sentence reductions prisoners in Washington state had received for good behaviour.It was introduced in 2002 as part of an update that followed a court ruling about applying good behaviour credits.State officials said that many early-release prisoners would have to return to jail to finish their sentences.""That this problem was allowed to continue for 13 years is deeply disappointing to me, totally unacceptable and, frankly, maddening,"" said Washington's governor Jay Inslee at a press conference.The Washington Department of Corrections (DoC) added that it was made aware of the problem in 2012 when the family of one victim found out that the offender was getting out too early.Despite this, the faulty software was not corrected until a new IT boss for the DoC was appointed, who realised how serious the problem had become.The manager then informed senior staff at the DoC and the governor's office.Analysis of the errors showed that, on average, prisoners whose sentences were wrongly calculated got out 49 days early. One prisoner had his sentence cut by 600 days. It is not known if any offender committed further crimes after being released prematurely.Local police are now helping to round up those who still need to spend time in jail. Five people have already been returned to cells.Mr Inslee said he had ordered the DoC to fix the software as quickly as possible.An update that applies the correct formula for calculating sentence cuts is due to be in place by 7 January. Until then the DoC has been ordered not to release any prisoner without checking manually that they should be released.An independent investigation has also been started to find out how the mistake was left uncorrected for so long."

But some have said it also covers tools that can improve cybersecurity.The move was praised by online freedom campaigners.The proposal to amend the deal ""represents a major victory for cybersecurity here and around the world,"" said US congressman Jim Langevin in a statement announcing the news.""While well-intentioned, the Wassenaar Arrangement's 'intrusion software' control was imprecisely drafted, and it has become evident that there is simply no way to interpret the plain language of the text in a way that does not sweep up a multitude of important security products.""The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which has also campaigned on the issue, agreed the deal had been reached with the best of intentions but its wording was too vague.While the EFF was happy changes were to be considered, it remained concerned the amended arrangement would continue to have ""serious chilling effects on security research"".Last year, the US authorities faced calls from Google to step back from restricting the flow of software as part of the 41-nation arms-control deal.At the time, Google said the definition of ""intrusion software"" was ""dangerously broad and vague"" and included information about bugs and vulnerabilities that could be vital to protect systems.Google's lawyer Neil Martin said the Wassenaar Arrangement would ""hamper our ability to defend ourselves, our users, and make the web safer"".But the US authorities insisted it balanced computer security with foreign policy concerns.Now, though, the US administration has said it supports making cyber-intrusion tools available overseas for legitimate cybersecurity activities.The EFF said: ""Human rights advocates have recognised that surveillance software designed and sold by companies in Western countries has been responsible for serious abuses around the world.""We at EFF have long fought such abuses in court.""We believe strongly that this is a fight worth having, but export controls are simply the wrong tool for the job.""Efforts to come up with a workable US rule have highlighted the difficulty of applying the export controls restricting physical items to a virtual world that relies on the free flow of information for network security.Many companies operate in multiple countries and routinely employ foreign nationals who test their own corporate networks across borders.In May, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security proposed denying the transfer of offensive tools, defined as software that uses ""zero-day"" exploits, or unpatched new vulnerabilities, and ""rootkit"" abilities that allow a person administrator-level access to a system.But in the cyber-world, testing a network often requires determining first how to exploit it and then attempting to do so.US government departments did not respond to requests for comment."
technology	Smart car software tinkering legal - US ruling	'Protection'Serious reservations	"Security researchers have been given the green light to hunt for flaws in car software by US authorities.A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright.Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues.The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal.The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported.Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation.""Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,"" the statement said.Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright.Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are ""pervasive"" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices.""We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,"" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes.In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny.""When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,"" Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said.Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them.""EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,"" the Library of Congress said in its final rule.However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare."
technology	Software bug prompts Range Rover recall	Blank keys	"Land Rover is recalling more than 65,000 cars to fix a software bug that can ""unlatch"" the vehicles' doors.Drivers would get no dashboard warning that the doors of their car had been unlocked, the firm said.The glitch affects Range Rover and Range Rover Sport vehicles sold between 2013 and now.In a statement, Land Rover said no accidents or injuries were reported to have occurred as a result of the bug.Range Rover owners would not have to pay for the modifications to be made, it added.Adverts have been placed in newspapers informing owners about the recall and the ""unlatching"" issue.Land Rover said the recall was not related to widely-reported problems with keyless ignition and locking systems on some luxury cars that had made them favourites with car thieves.Last year car thieves were found to be targeting some models of Range Rovers and BMW X5s because they found it easy to unlock the vehicles.It is believed that a handheld ""black box"" was being used by some gangs to unlock and start cars that had keyless ignition systems.Some newspapers reported that insurers were unwilling to extend cover to Range Rover owners unless they could park in secure, off-street car parks. Other insurance firms insisted on the use of tracking systems that could help find a car if it was stolen.""It's been known for over a year that keyless entry and ignition systems possess certain vulnerabilities,"" said a spokesman for Thatcham Research which gathers data on car crime.""There were a number of vehicles suggested as being vulnerable in this way, Range Rovers being one of them,"" he said.Other cars targeted include Ford Focus and Fiestas, Audis and some light commercial vehicles.""That was all to do with keyless entry systems and vulnerabilities through the onboard diagnostic port,"" he said.A thief who got access to a car could plug a device into that port that helped to re-program a blank key so it could be used to start the car, he said. Cars were being stolen to order or were being broken up for cheap spares.""All the manufacturers have been working hard to find a solution to this and are well on the way to introducing preventative measures,"" he said."
technology	Deepfake videos could 'spark' violent social unrest	Call to action	"Deepfake technology could spark ""violent outbreaks"", an expert warns.The warning came during a hearing in the US House of Representatives on deepfake technology that can create convincing videos of public figures.Public safety could be put at risk if it was adopted by those pushing ""false conspiracies"", said Clint Watts, from the Foreign Policy Research Institute,Its threat could be countered by making social media services liable for fake videos users share, one witness said.The US House Intelligence Committee called witnesses to testify about the peril and promise of deepfake technology.The hearing came a day after Facebook was criticised for not removing a manipulated video that appeared to show Mark Zuckerberg credit a secretive organisation for its success.The video was created with deepfake software that makes it easy to generate fake videos using still images of a person.During his testimony, Mr Watts said AI-based deepfake software could become key tools for propagandists.""Those countries with the most advanced AI capabilities and unlimited access to large data troves will gain enormous advantages in information warfare,"" he said.""The circulation of deepfakes may incite physical mobilisations under false pretences, initiating public safety crises and sparking the outbreak of violence,"" Mr Watts said.He pointed to the spate of false conspiracies proliferating via WhatsApp in India as an example of how bogus messages and media were already fuelling violence.""The spread of deepfake capabilities will only increase the frequency and intensity of these violent outbreaks,"" he said.Further warnings about the potential harm of deepfakes came from legal expert Prof Danielle Citron, from the University of Maryland.Prof Citron said deepfakes were already being used as a political tool and cited the case of investigative journalist Rana Ayyub, who in April 2018 was subjected to prolonged harassment after opponents created deepfake sex videos of her.Deepfakes were ""particularly troubling when they were provocative and destructive"", said Prof Citron, adding this was the type of content people were most likely to share as they were often crafted to play on biases and prejudices.Countering the spread of the fake videos was hard, she said, but it was perhaps time to revisit US legislation that gave immunity from prosecution to social media platforms no matter what users posted.""We should condition the legal immunity to be based on reasonable content practices,"" said Prof Citron. ""It should not be a free pass."""
technology	Facebook offers free education software in US	Project time	"Facebook has taken its first steps into the education market with software that it claims allows children to learn at their own pace.It is working with non-profit Summit Public Schools which has pioneered a teaching method that allows students to learn online and be mentored in class.Facebook said that the project was completely separate from its social network.There has been some scepticism about the technology firm's move.In a blog post, Facebook's chief product officer Chris Cox said that the firm wanted to create a classroom ""centred around students' ambitions"".The system allows content and tests to be delivered online and classroom time is reserved for ""teacher-led real-world projects and collaborations"", it said.""The technology itself has the power to bring to life the daily work by putting it in context,"" said Mr Cox.""It frees up classroom time for teachers to do what they do best - mentor students directly - and for students to spend time collaborating with, and in some cases, teaching each other.""But not everyone was convinced of the move.""We are very concerned about the privacy implications of this deal. Facebook is known for violating privacy and seems to be getting worse in this regard,"" Leonie Haimson from US non-profit Class Size Matters told the BBC.""Who will control access to the personal student data and who will protect it? Who will decide? Parents or Facebook or the schools or districts? This is a critical question which must be answered - especially given its reputation.""The small team of engineers working on the project were subject to ""strict privacy controls to help protect student data"", Facebook said.The Personalised Learning Plan it has developed has so far been used by 2,000 students and 100 teachers in schools in California.Summit Public Schools, Facebook's partner in the project, is a non-profit organisation that runs schools in the states of California and Washington.There are several elements to Summit's curriculum - students spend some time working on projects and other time on the personalised learning of traditional subjects like maths and English - mostly via online content.Ms Haimson is not convinced it is the best method to teach children.""There is a growing body of research showing that online or 'blended' learning actually widens the achievement gap,"" she said.""The educational tech boosters call it personalised learning, but its really depersonalised learning. Most parents don't want their kids spending any more time in front of computer screens than they do already - but want more human interaction with their teachers and their classmates.""Facebook and Summit plan to offer the software to any school in the US that wants it.The social network is not the only technology giant involved in education. Google offers a range of educational products and Chromebooks are commonplace in classrooms."
technology	Macs vulnerable to 'bananas' Zoom video flaw	Bug handling	"Hackers could access cameras on millions of Apple Macs thanks to a vulnerability in Zoom's video-conferencing software, a security researcher has found.Jonathan Leitschuh uncovered a way to force almost any Mac that has Zoom's app installed to join a video call.One tech veteran who found he was at risk called the flaw ""bananas"".Zoom disagreed about the severity of the issue but has updated its software so it is harder to abuse.Mr Leitschuh said the problem arose because of the way Zoom sets up meetings and video-conferences.Generally, he said, this involves an organiser sending a web link to other people that they simply click on to join the meeting.To make joining meetings easier, the Zoom Mac software puts a web server on every machine it is installed on. This handles the tricky job of interpreting the clicked link and connecting all the different machines together.Not all Macs were vulnerable, said the researcher. Only those users who did not change a setting that turned off video when they joined a meeting were at risk, he said.Hackers could exploit the flaw by putting booby-trapped code on websites that connected to the hidden web server when victims click on them.""This Zoom vulnerability is bananas,"" wrote blogging pioneer Matt Haughey on Twitter. He said he clicked one of the proof-of-concept links Mr Leitschuh supplied and connected to three other people ""freaking out about it in real time"".Mr Leitschuh discovered that the web server is standalone software that persists on Macs even if the main Zoom software is removed. In his blog, he provided instructions on how to manually uninstall the server.The problem does not occur on Windows machines because they handle Zoom meeting links in a different way.In his blog, the security researcher said he first contacted Zoom about the problem in late March warning it that he planned to go public with the information in 90 days.A series of discussions with Zoom's security team followed, he added, which led the company to propose what Mr Leitschuh described as a ""quick fix"".Zoom disputed this version of events and said it had engaged with Mr Leitschuh within ""minutes"" of being told about the flaw.It said it would be ""readily apparent"" that anyone had fallen victim because the Zoom video application is programmed to be the foremost window on a user's screen.It added that it had ""no indication"" that any of its millions of users had fallen victim in this way and said it disagreed with Mr Leitschuh about the ""severity"" of the issue.An update to Zoom has been rolled out that changes the way links for meetings are set up and that ensures video is turned off as a default, it said.Zoom also planned to set up a public bug bounty programme that will pay researchers for finding flaws. Currently, Zoom runs an invitation-only bug hunting scheme."
technology	Samsung faces legal action over phone software	App removal	"Samsung is being taken to court in China over the software it loads on to its handsets.A Chinese consumer protection group launched the legal action over the default apps or ""bloatware"" found on Samsung phones.It said many people did not want the software and added that the firm made it hard to remove the applications.The Shanghai Consumer Council also filed a similar case against Chinese phone-maker Oppo.The council said it was motivated to start the legal action following a growing number of complaints about pre-installed apps. It said people had complained because of the space the apps took up and because they ate into data allowances when they were updated.Results from a study carried out by the council said a standard Galaxy Note 3 could contain 44 pre-installed programs that could not be removed or were hard to disable. One Oppo phone tested by the council was found to have 47 apps that could not be uninstalled.""The litigation is our latest attempt to safeguard consumers' rights after other methods failed,"" Tao Ailian, secretary general of the council, told the Shanghai Daily.The legal action aims to make the two phone-makers put in place systems that let people remove the apps easily and warn them about what they get when they buy a new phone.In a statement, Samsung said: ""We have not yet received the formal complaint filed by the Shanghai Consumer Council.""We will thoroughly review the court document and determine an appropriate response,"" it added."
technology	Cybercriminals exploit bug in Adobe Flash software	Criminal toolboxes	"An exploit that takes advantage of a flaw in Adobe's Flash Player is being used by cybercriminals.The problem was only patched by an update from Adobe last week, meaning many users are still believed to be at risk.Two exploit kits, which allow criminals to compromise computers in a variety of ways, can now target the bug.This was spotted by a French security researcher known as Kafeine.Kafeine said that more people are likely to be vulnerable to the exploit since it targets a relatively recent version of the browser-based Flash Player software, 18.0.0.160. The latest version is 18.0.0.194.Before being flagged by Adobe, the vulnerability was considered a zero-day - meaning it had not previously been disclosed and there was no known fix. Kafeine added that a handful of similar bugs have been discovered in Flash Player since January.The two kits in question, Angler and Magnitude are relatively popular, according to security analyst Rik Ferguson at Trend Micro.Many are worried that in this case the exploit could be used to deploy ransomware, which restricts access to a victim's computer until a ransom fee is paid.""Angler is a very... widespread toolkit,"" said Mr Ferguson. ""It's really just a framework that is being used to deliver whatever the exploiter wants to deliver... Besides ransomware, it could just as easily be used to deliver banking malware, DDoS bots, spam bots, whatever.""Mr Ferguson added that according to their records, a large proportion of Trend Micro customers still appeared to be using versions of Flash Player vulnerable to the attack.David Emm, a security expert at Kaspersky, commented that certain security programmes would be able to protect users against exploits like these, but that updating vulnerable software was recommended.""As always, the best policy here is to make sure your application and the operating system you use have all the updates installed,"" he said.Adobe has urged users to download the latest Flash Player update."
technology	Hackers get chance to target US satellite	Live challenge	"Ethical hackers are getting the chance to see if they can crack the security on an orbiting US Defense Department satellite, reports Wired.Vetted experts will tackle the satellite and its control systems at the 2020 Def Con hacker conference.The demonstration follows a session at Def Con 2019 that let researchers tackle an F-15 fighter jet computer.The Air Force said Def Con demos were part of efforts to expose military systems to better security checks.""We have to get over our fear of embracing external experts to help us be secure,"" Will Roper, assistant secretary of the US Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics, told the tech news magazine.He said that before now, the US military had kept its technology to itself and assumed that this meant it was secure.In a separate interview, Mr Roper told military news site C4ISR that a closed attitude ""made sense"" during the Cold War but was now outdated.""Now technology changes so rapidly and most of it is driven by software,"" he said. ""The idea that closed can make you more secure is a hypothesis we need to question.""The satellite hacking stunt will have a testing phase that will see the USAF advertise for and then vet security researchers for the challenge.Eligible ethical hackers will try their skills on components used in military satellite systems in a series of trials. The best performers in these challenges will be invited to Def Con in Las Vegas for a ""live"" event at which they will try to compromise the working satellite.Mr Roper said hackers would be trying to take over the camera on the satellite and use it to take a photograph of the Moon. Successful hackers or teams will get paid a ""bug bounty"" for their work.The Def Con events have grown out of a separate initiative called Hack the Air Force that sees ethical hackers look for bugs in various USAF systems. The most recent Hack the Air Force event held throughout December 2018 found 120 separate vulnerabilities. The USAF paid hackers more than $130,000 (£103,000) in bounties for finding the bugs."
technology	Facebook lets deepfake Zuckerberg video stay on Instagram	Political row	"Facebook has said it will not remove a manipulated video of its chief Mark Zuckerberg from Instagram, in which he appears to credit a secretive organisation for his success.The clip is a ""deepfake"", made by AI software that uses photos of a person to create a video of them in action.Facebook had previously been criticised for not removing a doctored clip of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The latest decision coincided with the announcement of 500 new jobs in London.The social network has said many of the posts will be involved in building machine-learning based software of its own to automatically detect and remove malicious content posted to its platforms.In addition, they will build tools to help human workers review potentially harmful material.The company said it would bring its tally to more than 3,000 jobs in the capital by the end of 2019.The deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg was created for an art installation on display in Sheffield called Spectre. It is designed to draw attention to how people can be monitored and manipulated via social media in light of the Cambridge Analytica affair - among other scandals.It features a computer-generated image of the chief executive's face merged with footage of his body sourced from a video presentation given in 2017 at an office in Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters. An actor provided the audio recording it is synched to.The 16-second clip - which plays on a loop - was uploaded to Instagram on Saturday.However, it only gained prominence after Motherboard reported on its existence on Tuesday.""The result is fairly realistic - if you leave the video muted,"" commented the news site.""The voice superimposed on the video is clearly not Zuckerberg, but someone attempting an impression.""The account involved had labelled the video with a #deepfake hashtag.The Instagram post has now been viewed more than 25,000 times. Copies have also been shared via Facebook itself.""We will treat this content the same way we treat all misinformation on Instagram,"" said a spokesman for the app's parent company Facebook.""If third-party fact-checkers mark it as false, we will filter it from Instagram's recommendation surfaces like Explore and hashtag pages.""The artists involved said they ""welcomed"" Facebook's decision but still questioned the company's ethics.""We feel that by using art to engage and critically explore this kind of technology, we are attempting to interrogate the power of these new forms of computational propaganda and as a result would not like to see our artwork censored by Facebook,"" they told the BBC.""We would however welcome meaningful regulation and oversight of the digital influence industry.""Had Facebook opted to block the post, it could have faced accusations of hypocrisy after refusing to remove a manipulated clip of Ms Pelosi three weeks ago.That video was not a deepfake, but had been slowed down in parts to make the Democratic leader's speech appear garbled.The tech firm said at the time that information posted to its site did not need to be ""true"". But it said it would limit how often the video appeared in members' news feeds, and provide a link to fact-checking sites.Ms Pelosi subsequently criticised the firm saying: ""Right now they are putting up something they know is false.""""I can take it ... But [Facebook is] lying to the public.""The Washington Post has since reported that Mr Zuckerberg tried to personally contact Ms Pelosi to discuss the matter, but she had not responded.Update 13 June 2019:Facebook says it has classed the video as being ""misinformation"" and has filtered it from recommended hashtag and Explore pages on Instagram as a consequence.In response, the artists involved have told the BBC that they believe this sets a ""dangerous precedent"" since they had clearly labelled the post as being art."
technology	'Deepfake' app causes fraud and privacy fears in China	What's Zao and why is it so controversial?Could Zao be used to defraud banks?What's the reaction been?	"An artificial-intelligence app that allows users to insert their faces in place of film and TV characters has caused controversy in China.Zao has sparked privacy fears and suggestions it could be used to defeat systems using facial recognition.It appeared in China on 29 August and has proven wildly popular.But it has led to developers Momo apologising for its end-user agreement, which stripped users of the rights to their images.And as the app went viral, Zao's owners aired fears users were devouring its expensively purchased server capacity.Its popularity has also lead to assurances from Alipay, part of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, saying that it's impossible for so-called deepfake videos created by the app to be used to cheat its Smile to Pay facial-recognition system.Zao is a face-swapping app that uses clips from films and TV shows, convincingly changing a character's face by using selfies from the user's phone.But some users had noted the app's terms and conditions ""gave the developers the global right to permanently use any image created on the app for free"", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported.""Moreover, the developers had the right to transfer this authorisation to any third party without further permission from the user,"" the paper said, adding experts believed this broke Chinese law.Momo had subsequently deleted the controversial clause and issued an apology, saying its app would not store users' biometric information nor ""excessively collect user information"", Shanghai-based The Paper said.But popular social media platform WeChat quickly banned users from uploading Zao videos via its platform, citing ""security risks"".The app may also be a victim of its own success, with Zao saying, on its Sina Weibo social media account, it had used up a third of its monthly server capacity, budgeted at 7m yuan (£805,000), on its first night.And the following day, as users complained of a slow service, it said, ""with a heavy heart"", servers were at fully capacity.Alipay, the world's largest mobile payment platform, with over 870 million users, has assured its users videos created in Zao cannot be used to defraud its systems.Many Alipay users take advantage of its Smile to Pay system, which allows payment verification by the user looking into a camera at a shop or restaurant's point-of-sale.Alibaba, which owns Alipay, says it uses sophisticated anti-spoofing algorithms to make sure it isn't fooled by still photographs or deepfake videos.""There is a lot of online face-changing software - but no matter how realistic, it is impossible to break through the facial payment system"", the company said on its Weibo account.Even before the system attempts to match the face, it detects whether the presented image is a still, video or software simulation.""This avoids fraud caused by face-changing technology,"" Alibaba said.Momo also moved to calm fears Zao could be used for fraud, clarifying Alipay's point it only used and adapted still photographs for its deepfake videos.""The facial payment security threshold is extremely high, and 'face-changing' technology realised by only one photo can't break through the security system,"" the developers said.It was ""completely impossible"" for deepfakes of this kind to threaten payment security, Momo told The Paper.And last year, academic Pan Helin told China Daily Alipay's facial recognition was ""theoretically a more secure and convenient method than the conventional use of passwords"".Concerns over the app reached state-run Chinese press.Global Times said it was another example of ""concerning"" AI-powered apps ""which could be used maliciously"".China was already considering tightening regulations governing AI face-stitching technology, the paper said.And lawyer Zhang Xinnian told it the laws governing phone apps' terms and conditions needed to be tightened.Zao's initial terms ""violated user privacy and once personal information is leaked and abused it could lead to criminal incidents"", he added.Meanwhile, law professor Zhu Wei told state news agency Xinhua: ""People are using a mobile client that involves information about personal identity, property, scan codes and mobile payments and they can't see exactly what information is obtained by the app, so it is very dangerous.""A commentary in the Beijing News even asked whether the app could become ""a threat to national security"".With genuine concerns about national and personal security from Zao and future deepfake services, ""it is necessary to regulate them as soon as possible with clear legal provisions"", it added.A Guangzhou Daily editorial said: ""Changing-face videos is fun but the potential security risks cannot be ignored.""And The Paper said while Zao's popularity would be short-lived, its arrival had made it easier for dark actors to take advantage of face-changing technology.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

technology	Huawei chief offers to share 5G know-how for a fee	Seeking 'balance'Intelligence law	"Huawei's chief executive has proposed selling its current 5G know-how to a Western firm as a way to address security concerns voiced by the US and others about its business.Ren Zhengfei said the buyer would be free to ""change the software code"".That would allow any flaws or supposed backdoors to be addressed without Huawei's involvement.The US and Australia have banned their networks from using Huawei's equipment. The UK is still weighing a decision.Huawei has repeatedly denied claims that it would help the Chinese government spy on or disrupt other countries' telecoms systems, and says it is a private enterprise owned by its workers.One expert, who had previously cast doubts on Huawei's claims to independence, said the idea of it helping another country's business to compete represented an ""extraordinary offer"".""Perhaps the explanation is that Huawei recognises that it is unlikely to be able to bypass the efforts the Trump administration is putting into minimising its scope to operate in North America, Western Europe and Australasia,"" said Prof Steve Tsang from Soas University of London.""But it's difficult to see Nokia or Ericsson being interested in buying it. And it's also difficult to see how an American company would be able to reassure the Trump administration that it's absolutely top notch American technology.""And if they can't do that, why would they want to spend tens of billions of US dollars on something that will quickly become out-of-date.""Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei made the proposal in interviews with the Economist and the New York Times.It would include ongoing access to the firm's existing 5G patents, licences, code, technical blueprints and production engineering knowledge.""[Huawei is] open to sharing our 5G technologies and techniques with US companies, so that they can build up their own 5G industry,"" the NYT quoted Ren as saying.""This would create a balanced situation between China, the US and Europe.""Speaking to the Economist he added: ""A balanced distribution of interests is conducive to Huawei's survival.""A spokesman for Huawei has confirmed the quotes are accurate and the idea represents a ""genuine proposal"".At present, Europe's Nokia and Ericsson are the main alternatives to Huawei when it comes to networks selecting what 5G cell tower base stations and other equipment to install.South Korea's Samsung and China's ZTE are other alternatives.But while American firms including Cisco, Dell EMC and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have developed 5G-related technologies, the US lacks an infrastructure-equipment specialist of its own.Beyond the licensing fee, Huawei could benefit because it might convince Washington to drop restrictions that currently prevent it buying US-linked technologies for its own use.One consequence of this is that Huawei faces having to launch an Android smartphone later this month that will not offer Google apps such as YouTube or the Play Store.A deal would also help ensure Huawei gets its 5G technologies widely adopted.For instance, 5G supports two different coding techniques for data transmission to help tackle interference.Huawei has developed a technique called ""polar codes"", which it says will give 5G devices longer battery life than an alternative favoured by many Western firms called ""low density parity check"".If polar codes are widely adopted, Huawei will earn more patent fees from device-makers that support them.One company-watcher, however, suggested Ren's proposal was doomed to fail.""Huawei misunderstands the underlying problem,"" Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told the BBC.""The issue is not the trustworthiness of Huawei as a vendor but the legal obligations that the Chinese government imposes on it.""China's National Intelligence Law requires Chinese businesses and citizens to surrender any data or 'communication tools' they may have access to, under strict punitive sanctions.""Any equipment or software that Huawei licenses to an US entity would still fall under this obligation, and there is no way that the licensing entity or the intelligence agencies could scrutinise millions of lines of code for potential backdoors.""But Prof Tsang said the proposal was still a ""smart move"".Even if Huawei's offer is ultimately rejected, he explained, it demonstrates that the company is willing to go to remarkable lengths to try and win the West's trust."
technology	OU students' progress to be monitored by software	'Great idea'	"Students at the Open University are going to have their progress monitored by software to spot if they need any extra support.The scheme, developed by the OU, has been designed to observe students' paths through courses and engagement with online learning modules.The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: ""This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students.""We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16.""The program, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year.It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms.The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening.Prof Domingue added: ""We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable.""Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling.""The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.""The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one.""It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,"" she told the BBC.""I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage.""That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.""Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: ""I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities. It has happened in the USA and I'm surprised they're not using it here."""
technology	Google criticises US rules on finding software bugs		"A US plan to require a licence to export ""intrusion software"" would make the web more dangerous, Google says.The 41 nations in the Wassenaar arms-control arrangement want it updated to stop oppressive regimes acquiring net-based surveillance systems.But Google says their definition of ""intrusion software"" is ""dangerously broad and vague"" including information about bugs and vulnerabilities.The US says the plan balances computer security and foreign policy goals.Google, like many other companies, uncovers thousands of vulnerabilities, such as Heartbleed and Poodle, every year, and seeking a licence to publish information about each one would slow the process.Google lawyer Neil Martin said the change would ""hamper our ability to defend ourselves, our users, and make the web safer"".""It would be a disastrous outcome if an export regulation intended to make people more secure resulted in billions of users across the globe becoming persistently less secure.""Google said it would ask the US Department of Commerce to put in place exemptions for vulnerability research and to allow companies that operated internationally to easily share information internally."
technology	Google Gmail users hit by software glitch		"Gmail users around the world saw errors and safety warnings over the weekend after Google forgot to update a key part of the messaging software.Google said a ""majority"" of users were affected by the short-term software problem.While people could still access and use Gmail many people saw ""unexpected behaviour"" because of the problem.Many reported the errors via Twitter seeking clarification from Google about what had gone wrong.The error messages started appearing early on 4 April and hit people trying to send email messages from Gmail and some of the firm's messaging apps.The problems arose because Google had neglected to renew a security certificate for Gmail and its app services. The certificate helps the software establish a secure connection to a destination, so messages can be sent with little fear they will be spied upon.Google's own in-house security service, called Authority G2, administers the security certificates and other secure software systems for the search giant.Information about the problem was posted to status pages Google maintains for its apps and email services.In the status message, Google said the problem was ""affecting a majority of users"" who were seeing error messages. It added that the glitch could cause programs to act in ""unexpected"" ways.The problem was resolved about two hours after it was first noticed.The glitch comes soon after Google started refusing security certificates issued by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). Google said a security lapse by the CNNIC meant the certificates could no longer be trusted. CNNIC called the decision ""unacceptable and unintelligible""."
technology	Panda antivirus software labels itself as malware	Corrupted files	"An antivirus program labelled itself as malware, causing some computers it was running on to stop working.After an update, essential components in two Panda Security antivirus programs became corrupted, leading them to be mistakenly identified as malign and quarantined.Panda said a fix had been released and warned that rebooting affected systems could exacerbate the issue.It asked those affected to get in touch so it could help fix their machines.One security expert noted the irony. ""People's first response is to turn [their computer] off and back on again, but in this case it seems like the wrong thing to do,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.The ""last thing"" people would expect to cause their computers to break down was its security software, he said.Panda Security said that the signature file in both its PCOP and its Retail 2015 packages became corrupted.""The signature file was repaired immediately. Additionally, a solution for all affected products has been automatically deployed. However, in certain environments it is possible for the incident to persist.""It added a list of steps that affected users could take to ensure that their system was clear of the issue.Prof Woodward said the episode was ""not a great advert for Panda"". He said he had heard of some companies losing the use of multiple computers to the issue. He added that data loss was a risk if machines were rebooted.But Panda Security said it was helping people whose machines had stopped working to restore them and that it had no evidence anyone had experienced permanent data loss as a result of the issue.A Panda Security spokeswoman said: ""We have solved 90% of the incidents, and support is being given in real time to the ones that still have some issues.""The company said that only 8% of the ""millions"" of PCOP and Retail 2015 customers were affected by the issue.

There will be an update tomorrow, which will automatically update all 57,568 users of these specific PrivDog versions.""PrivDog - a tool designed to block ads and replace them with ones from ""trusted sources"" - joins a growing list of software affected by related security flaws.Experts say they have uncovered a further dozen examples since Superfish was brought to the public's attention last week.Superfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones.But it compromises security by intercepting connections and issuing fake certificates - the ID's used to identify websites - to trick sites into handing over data. This a practice commonly known as a man-in-the-middle attack.Lenovo has since issued a tool to allow users to remove the hidden software. It now faces legal action from a group of users who say that it acted unlawfully in pre-loading it.PrivDog, has been described by several experts as being ""worse than Superfish"".A particular concern is its links to the security firm Comodo, which issues a third of the secure certificates used on the web.PrivDog was developed by the founder of Comodo, Melih Abdulhayogulu, and some versions of it are packaged with Comodo's own software.But Comodo told the BBC that the affected versions ""had never been distributed"" by it.A discussion begun on the Hacker News forum first uncovered that in the process of swapping adverts, PrivDog also appeared to leave machines vulnerable to attack.In a blogpost freelance technology journalist Hanno Boeck explained: ""A quick analysis shows that it doesn't have the same flaw as Superfish, but it has another one which arguably is even bigger.""""PrivDog is in every sense as malicious as Superfish,"" added Simon Crosby, co-founder of security firm Bromium.""It intercepts and decrypts supposedly secure communication between the browser and a remote site - such as the user's bank - ostensibly to insert its own advertising into pages in the browser.""It is substantially more scary, though, because PrivDog effectively turns your browser into one that just accepts every https certificate out there without checking its validity, increasing vulnerability to phishing attacks, for example.""Last week Comodo announced that it had become the number one digital certificate authority in the world, with its products used by nearly 35% of all websites ending in .com.""They are one of the leading certificate authorities, and the fact that PrivDog is issuing fake certificates is shocking,"" said Marc Rogers, principal researcher at security firm CloudFlare.In a blogpost written at the beginning of 2014, Mr Abdulhayogulu said that he had developed PrivDog ""with the privacy of the user in mind"".""Isn't it great that the company whose DNA is about your security makes more money so that they can continue to innovate and invest in products that make you safer,"" he wrote at the time.Security experts have identified a growing list of software that appears to interfere with SSL.Most of the products were developed by security firms, said Mr Rogers.They include anti-malware software and tools designed to offer parents more control over their children's web browsing.All can be traced back to Komodia - technology developed by an Israeli firm, which describes itself as a ""SSL hijacker"".At the time of writing, Komodia's website was offline. It blamed this on a denial-of-service attack prompted by ""recent media attention""."
technology	King's Cross facial-recognition plans revealed by letter	'Blurred out'	"King's Cross Central's developers said they wanted facial-recognition software to spot people on the site who had previously committed an offence there.The detail has emerged in a letter one of its managers sent to the London mayor, on 14 August. Sadiq Khan had sought reassurance using facial recognition on the site was legal.Two days before, Argent indicated it was using it to ""ensure public safety"".On Monday, it said it had now scrapped work on new uses of the technology.But its earlier, ""limited"" facial-recognition system had been in use until March 2018.In the August letter, Argent partner Robert Evans wrote: ""We introduced a limited facial-recognition capability alongside our CCTV system in 2015, limited to two cameras along King's Boulevard, to help deploy and direct our estate teams.""However, ongoing construction work in the areas means that this system has not been operational continually since that date.""The facial-recognition system is not currently operational and has not been so for over 12 months.""The Home Office's Surveillance Camera Code of Practice says ""there must be as much transparency in the use of a surveillance camera system as possible"" and ""any use of facial recognition or other biometric characteristic recognition systems needs to be clearly justified"".The code was drawn up to address prior concerns about private-sector organisations sharing access to surveillance technology with the police.Argent has said it used the system to ""help the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police prevent and detect crime"".However, a British Transport Police spokesman told BBC News it had never ""contributed, nor has benefited, from any trial of facial recognition technology in the Kings Cross estate"".The letter goes on to reference plans for a new ""upgraded system"".""[It] is designed to run in the background, effectively dormant unless it matches against a small number of 'flagged' individuals (for example, individuals who have committed an offence on the estate or high risk-missing persons).""At this point, all other faces are automatically blurred out when the footage is played back or captured.""The system does not does not store the facial images of others.""The letter makes clear Argent was already ""in the process of installing"" the upgraded system at the time of writing.Monday's statement, however, had referred only to ""work on the potential introduction of new FRT [facial recognition technology]"".The letter goes on to say Argent had been audited by an independent company to ensure it was compliant with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the privacy law that came into effect last year.And it said it intended to work with the Information Commissioner's Office before turning on its upgraded system to ensure it was fully compliant with the law.The ICO has made it clear any software that recognises a face in a crowd and then matches it against a database of people counts as the processing of personal data, whether or not the faces are subsequently blurred out.It launched an investigation into the use of live facial-recognition technology at King's Cross on 15 August and has yet to report its findings.Argent has said it has ""no plans to reintroduce any form"" of facial-recognition technology at the site at this time.""It is an absolute scandal that this has been going on, apparently in secret, in the centre of London for years,"" commented Silkie Carlo from the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch.""We hope the ICO takes the most robust available action."""
technology	Airbus A400M plane crash linked to software fault	Grounded flights	"Investigators have found evidence a military plane crash in Spain may have been caused by software problems.The Airbus A400M crashed near Seville, on 9 May, after a failed emergency landing during its first flight.The four crew members on board were killed in the accident.A spokesman for the European planemaker told the BBC that its engineers had since discovered anomalies in the aircraft's data logs that could be relevant to the accident.It has sent out an alert to other air forces that have taken deliveries of the propeller aircraft, saying that they should carry out checks of the Electronic Control Units (ECU) on board.""For practical purposes, these are computers, and there is one on each engine,"" the spokesman said.""What the ECU does is take the pilot's inputs on the controls and then makes the engines perform in the optimum way to achieve what the pilot is asking it to do, taking a whole number of things into account.""You can conclude that as we've asked for checks to be made on the ECU, that that is the area of interest.""He added that problems had only been found after the company's investigators had checked both the maintenance data gathered by Airbus's flight-operations team and the logs that had been generated during ground tests of flight MSN23.""The maintenance data is vast streams of data showing everything going on all over the aeroplane, and one of the things we saw seems as if it could be pertinent to the accident,"" he said.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the problem might have been caused by the way the software had been installed rather than an issue with its design.The A400M was created to give Europe's Nato partners independent access to heavy aircraft to transport troops and large weaponry.It was originally budgeted to cost €20bn ($22.3bn; £14.5bn) under a fixed-price contract in 2003.But European defence ministers subsequently had to provide extra funds to Airbus after cost overruns and delays.The first plane was eventually delivered to France in August 2013.But last month's accident means that the countries that have bought the aeroplane - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain and Turkey - face the prospect of further delays.""Until more detail about the cause of the recent A400M crash in Seville is known, the RAF has paused flying of its A400M Atlas aircraft,"" said a spokeswoman for the UK's Ministry of Defence.""As an A400M operator, the UK MoD has received an Alert Operator Transmission (AOT) from Airbus Defence and Space, informing us of checks that should be made relating to aircraft engine software, and we can confirm that we will carry these out.""While Airbus is carrying out its own investigations, the official inquiry into the crash is being led by Spanish defence officials, who were unable to provide more detail.""The competent court has ruled secrecy of judicial inquiries. Therefore [Spain's] MoD won´t comment on any details affecting the course of investigation,"" said Capt Miguel Gonzalez Molina."
technology	Global virus fear prompts update for old Windows	Risky connection	"Fears of a massive global computer virus outbreak have prompted Microsoft to issue security updates for very old versions of its Windows software.One patch is for Windows XP, which debuted in 2001 and Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.Microsoft said the patch closed a hole that could be used to spread a virus.Malicious hackers exploiting it could kick off a worldwide outbreak like the 2017 Wannacry worm, which hit thousands of machines.It was ""highly likely"" the vulnerability would be exploited if it went unpatched, wrote Simon Pope, Microsoft's director of incident response, in a blog about the bug.He said the bug could be exploited simply by connecting to a vulnerable machine over the internet.""Any future malware that exploits this vulnerability could propagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a similar way as the WannaCry malware spread across the globe in 2017,"" he said.This danger prompted the release of a patch that closes the loophole in:Market industry data suggests about 3.75% of desktop machines currently use XP or its variants.Technology news site Wired said the wide range of vulnerable versions of Windows meant ""millions"" of machines were at risk.Although Microsoft ended support for Windows XP more than five years ago, the last software patch it issued for the operating system was released just prior to the Wannacry outbreak.""We strongly advise that all affected systems... should be updated as soon as possible,"" said Mr Pope.Microsoft said there was no evidence that cyber-criminals were currently exploiting the loophole.People and organisations using Windows 8 or 10 were not at risk, Microsoft said.Independent security expert Graham Cluley said the creation of the patch for XP showed the threat of a virulent worm was ""serious"".Many old and vulnerable systems were still ""riskily"" connected to the internet, he said, urging people to update swiftly."
technology	Disney video-dubbing software makes people speak gibberish	Viral videos	"Disney has developed software that automatically redubs video clips with new words that fit the speaker's lip movements.The program works by tracking variations in the shape of a subject's mouth and jaw, and then searching a pronunciation dictionary to find alternative words that match the moves.The firm says it can ""literally put plausible words"" into a person's mouth.But for now, the examples it has produced are of limited use.A video posted to YouTube shows an actor saying the short phrase ""salary and tenure"".The software identifies thousands of alternative phrases that could replace the utterance based on factors such as when the lips open to enunciate a vowel or close to express certain types of consonants.The program then ranks the strings of words according to the likelihood they would appear in that order in normal speech. This prevents it using ungrammatical phrases.A voice synthesiser subsequently creates some of the highly ranked phrases, ensuring each bit of sound - known as a phoneme - is timed to coincide with the appropriate lip movements. This is then used to replace the original sound.Examples of the replacement expressions created include:The system appears to have limitations.The actor involved had to be asked to keep the position of his head as still as possible and speak in a neutral tone to get the best results.And even with the ranking mechanism, many of the generated phrases appear to be gibberish.Disney's researchers acknowledge that the primary application of speech redubbing is to translate films and television programmes from one language to another.And it seems unlikely that the system could be used to find enough suitable matching phrases to re-voice a complete film or programme imperceptibly.However, it could potentially be used for more gimmicky applications.One YouTube video maker, for example, already specialises in making clips that replace the voices of well-known personalities with deliberately ridiculous lip-synched utterances for comedic effect.His creations include Beyonce singing nonsensically at US President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony and a version of Game Of Thrones where the characters appear to believe they are working in a theme park, both of which have been watched millions of times.Patrick Walker, chief executive of the viral video distribution network Rightster, noted that an existing app called Dubsmash had become popular by letting users replace their own voices in self-made videos with well-known quotes and sounds from films and songs.""Putting these kinds of tools in the hand of creators is the most important thing,"" he told the BBC.""If there was some way in which friends could get together and create their own versions of licensed clips from the Disney archive that would be interesting.""The other alternative would be a kind of 'lip synch roulette', in which you would say a phrase and then the app would fit it to a video clip from a database that it thought best matched. That would be cool and those clips could go viral.""For its part, Disney's research team says the most interesting insight from its work is the ""extreme level of ambiguity"" involved in trying to carry out speech recognition based on visual information alone."

technology	VW: Calls to let car software be examined by experts	Emission worriesCracking the codeSafety concerns	"Car-makers' should not be protected from independent scrutiny of their software by copyright laws, say campaigners.The call follows the discovery that Volkswagen coded some of its diesel cars to cut nitrous oxide emissions when tested in lab conditions.The Electronic Frontier Foundation suggests the deceit could have been uncovered earlier had researchers been able to look at the source code.But one expert said the idea was risky.VW's chief executive Martin Winterkorn has resigned after admitting his company had fitted computer-controlled ""defeat devices"" to more than 11 million vehicles.In the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibits people from circumventing ""technological protection measures"" that restrict access to copyrighted works.This includes reverse-engineering many products' machine code to turn it into a higher-level computer language that can be understood by humans.The EFF has long campaigned for automobile security researchers to be granted an exemption to the rule.But the lobby group notes that the US's Environment Protection Agency - the watchdog that is holding Volkswagen to account - had opposed the proposal in a letter earlier this year.""[We have previously] taken enforcement action against third-party vendors who sell or install equipment that can 'bypass, defeat or render inoperative' software designed to enable vehicles to comply with Clean Air Act regulations,"" the EPA's lawyer wrote to the US Copyright Office on 17 July.""Any benefit in exempting motor vehicle technological protection measures... is exceeded by the risk that lawful owners could, intentionally or not, modify that software in a way that would increase emissions.""The EFF suggested that VW's case demonstrated the approach had undermined the regulator's own goals.""When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,"" blogged Kit Walsh, the foundation's staff attorney.In the UK, security researchers face similar restrictions.""You're certainly not allowed to go digging into source code without permission,"" Jeremy Harris, from the law firm Kemp Little, told the BBC.""Copyright law does allow legal users to decompile machine code if it's to get two programs to work together, but you are not allowed to do it to go searching for flaws or other issues in someone else's product.""He noted, however, that car manufacturers and others could waive their rights in the wake of VW's scandal, to restore confidence.The Open Rights Group said it too had concerns about the status quo.""There is a need for car manufacturers to be more open about the technology they use,"" said spokeswoman Pam Cowburn.""We need to make sure that laws are not being used by corporations to prevent research that could make our society safer.""The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders declined to comment.But one industry analyst said there were good reasons for the industry to resist pressure to share its code.""Modern cars are heavily computer-controlled,"" said Chris Green, a tech consultant at Davies Murphy Group.""The computer code may well be controlling emissions, but it's also controlling safety features like when your air bags fire and anti-lock braking systems.""There is an argument for stopping people fiddling with those systems, because if you don't know what you are doing - or even worse do know and have malicious intent - you could create genuine safety issues.""One security researcher added that manufacturers might be worried about losing a competitive advantage.""Speaking personally, I don't think it should be illegal to reverse-engineer the code,"" said Ken Munro, from Pen Test Partners.""That said, I understand why manufacturers are reluctant to allow it.""There's a lot of effort, time and money put into creating the code, so they have a huge vested interest in keeping their proprietary tech locked down."""
technology	China and US clash over software backdoor proposals	'Paranoid espionage'Insecure systems	"Beijing has rejected President Obama's criticism of its plan to make tech companies put backdoors in their software and share their encryption keys if they want to operate in China.On Monday, Mr Obama told the Reuters news agency he had ""made it very clear"" China had to change its policy if it wanted to do business with the US.But Beijing said it needed the powers to combat terrorism and tackle leaks.It also suggested the West was guilty of having double standards.""The legislation is China's domestic affair, and we hope the US side can take a right, sober and objective view towards it,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.""On the information-security issue, there was a [recent] media revelation that a certain country embedded spying software in the computer system of another country's Sim card maker, for surveillance activities. This is only one out of the recently disclosed cases.""All countries are paying close attention to this and taking measures to safeguard their own information security, an act that is beyond any reproach.""The case she was referring to involved allegations that US cyber-spies had hacked a Dutch Sim card manufacturer in order to help decrypt their targets' communications.At another press conference, parliamentary spokeswoman Fu Ying drew attention to the fact that the US government had imposed restrictions on Chinese companies including Huawei and ZTE.And she suggested that Beijing's proposals were in line with the same kind of access to internet correspondence sought by the US and British governments.""We will definitely continue to listen to extensive concerns and all the parties' views, so we can make the law's formulation more rigorous,"" she added.The rules are part of a proposed counter-terrorism law set to be discussed by China's annual parliament session, the National People's Congress (NPC), which opens on Thursday.President Obama's comments had followed the publication of a fresh draft of the proposed law, which was made public last week.It ""would essentially force all foreign companies, including US companies, to turn over to the Chinese government mechanisms where they can snoop and keep track of all the users of those services"", the US leader said.""As you might imagine tech companies are not going to be willing to do that,"" he added.Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and IBM are among firms that would potentially be affected.While the comments by Chinese officials were measured, the government's press service, Xinhua, was more critical.It accused the US leader of arrogance and hypocrisy, noting that the FBI had criticised Apple and Google last year for building encryption into their smartphone operating systems, and again drew attention to allegations about the US National Security Agency's activities made public by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.""With transparent procedures, China's anti-terrorism campaign will be different from what the United States has done: letting the surveillance authorities run amok and turn counter-terrorism into paranoid espionage and peeping on its civilians and allies,"" Xinhua wrote.""Contrary to the accusations of the United States, China's anti-terror law will put no unfair regulatory pressures on foreign companies, because the provisions will apply to both domestic and foreign firms.""The Conservative party has indicated it wants to expand the UK's cyber-spies' surveillance powers it if wins the May election.""Our manifesto will make clear that we will... use all the legal powers available to us to make sure that, where appropriate, the intelligence and security agencies have the maximum capability to intercept the communications of suspects while making sure that such intrusive techniques are properly overseen,"" Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament in January.One expert said it should be no surprise that the West was finding it difficult to prevent China seeking greater cyber-surveillance powers of its own, but added there were good reasons to fear its proposals.""Either behind the scenes or increasingly openly, the US and UK are justifying similar behaviour for their own purposes, but are extremely concerned when China asks for its own capabilities,"" said Dr Joss Wright, from the Oxford Internet Institute.""But what we don't want to see is a world in which internet-based products and services are riddled with backdoors by every state that says it needs to act against terrorism.""Backdoors are always a concern because they result in a system that is insecure by default, and which can be exploited.

technology	London police trial gang violence 'predicting' software	Flagging threatsData-driven policing	"Police in London have tested software designed to identify which gang members are most likely to commit violent crimes.The 20-week pilot study is thought to have been the first of its kind in the UK, although similar experiments have been carried out elsewhere.It used five years worth of historic data, but the idea would be to analyse up-to-date details if it is deployed.Civil liberty campaigners have voiced concerns.But Accenture - the firm that developed the software - highlighted the potential benefit it offered.""You've got limited police resources and you need to target them efficiently,"" said Muz Janoowalla, head of public safety analytics at the company.""What this does is tell you who are the highest risk individuals that you should target your limited resources against.""The software works by merging together data from existing systems already used by the Metropolitan Police and carrying out predictive calculations.Types of information ranged from previous crimes to social media activity.""It's previous offending and various different sources that are used for intelligence, in terms of who they are involved with and who they associate with,"" explained Sarah Samee, a spokeswoman for the Met's Trident Gang Crime Command.Mr Janoowalla added: ""For example if an individual had posted inflammatory material on the internet and it was known about to the Met - one gang might say something [negative] about another gang member's partner or something like that - it would be recorded in the Met's intelligence system.""What we were able to do was mine both the intelligence and the known criminal history of individuals to come up with a risk assessment model.""The study used data gathered about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period to forecast their likelihood of committing further violent acts.This was then compared to known acts of aggression that took place in the fifth year to give an indication as to whether the software was accurate.Mr Janoowalla said the intention was to identify groups of gang members that were at the highest risk of reoffending rather than singling out specific individuals.He said that he was confident the experiment had been a success, but added that he was not allowed to disclose the exact criteria on which the software was being scored.Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch has asked for more information to be made public.""The police need to be very careful about how they use this kind of technology,"" said research director Daniel Nesbitt.""Big data solutions such as this can run the risk of unfairly targeting certain groups of people and potentially making them feel stigmatised as a result.""The Metropolitan Police must ensure that they are fully transparent about how they intend implement this technology and what type of information will be used in the process.""In response Mr Janoowalla noted that the Ministry of Justice already operated the Offender Assessment System and Offender Group Reconviction Scale (Oasys) - a computer-based system used to predict the likelihood of different types of released criminals reoffending.He said the key difference with Accenture's software was that it was specifically tailored to tackle gang violence.While Accenture and the Met believe this is the first test of its kind in the UK, the company has carried out other crime-prevention analysis elsewhere.In Spain it has tried to identify locations where crimes are most likely to happen, and in Singapore it has tested software that monitors video feeds of crowds, traffic and other events to alert the authorities to potential risks.Other companies are pitching rival tools. IBM has explored how factors including weather patterns, past crimes, and surveillance efforts can be combined to predict threats.And police in Kent, Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Yorkshire have all trialled software from PredPol, a US start-up, to help tackle street crime.However, campaign groups have warned against the danger of police gathering too much personal data.""It is clear that harnessing and analysing vast data sets may simplify the work of the police,"" said European human rights group Statewatch earlier this year""However, this in itself is not a justification for their use. There are all sorts of powers that could be given to law enforcement agencies, but which are not, due to the need to protect individual rights and the rule of law - effectiveness should never be the only yardstick by which law enforcement powers are assessed.""The ends of crime detection, prevention and reduction cannot in themselves justify the means of indiscriminate data-gathering and processing."""

That's a disgrace.""Sir Mark said: ""These algorithms are designed to push us towards contentious material because that feeds their bottom line of advertising revenues, by pushing readers to extremist material.""This is something Google denies, pointing out that it actually wants to get people off the platform and on to a third-party site as quickly as possible.Neither does it generally show adverts next to news-related enquiries, the BBC was told.Sir Mark said the scale and pace of all social-media firms' attempts to deal with the problem were ""completely insufficient"".The Home Affairs Select Committee grilled executives from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook this week over the amount of hate speech on their platforms.Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, was particularly angry at the amount of far-right content recommended to her on YouTube, questioning why the algorithms did that and whether they could be changed.YouTube executive Marco Pancini said it was working to make controversial content ""less visible"".But it is not just with regard to Islam that Google's algorithms produce contentious results.The first result in a search for ""UK Christian spokesman"" is Christian Voice - an organisation which has called for British law to be based on the Bible, and which opposes abortion, homosexuality and compulsory sex education.MPs asked the three social-media firms, Twitter, Facebook and Google, how they responded when they found users who were sharing propaganda.All three said they would give information on users to police only if there was ""an imminent threat of risk to life"".Sir Mark told the Today programme that the firms needed to do more to pass on any information they had about terrorist material being shared on their platforms."
technology	Biostar 2: Suprema plays down fingerprint leak reports	'In-depth investigation'Fingerprint samples 'checked'	"A biometric-security company has played down reports its software exposed ""a million"" fingerprints, making them vulnerable to hackers on the web.Suprema's Biostar 2 program was accessed online by cyber-security researchers earlier this month.The researchers say they found data from companies that use the system.Suprema said the access point had now been closed and an investigation had found the scope of the leak to be ""significantly less"" than reported.The cyber-security researchers involved, however, are standing by their research.One of them, Noam Rotem, told BBC News the evidence he had obtained did in fact indicate large amounts of biometric data had been made available online.He and his colleague Ran Locar had worked with cyber-security company VPNMentor to disclose the breach.South Korea-headquartered Suprema makes a range of products, including fingerprint readers that allow companies to control access to specific areas of sites or buildings.""Last week, we were made aware that some BioStar 2 customer user data was accessed by third-party security researchers without authorisation for a limited period of time,"" the company said in a statement.""There are no indications that the data was downloaded during the incident based on the investigation to date.""We have also engaged a leading global forensics firm to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident.""Based on their investigation to date, they have confirmed that no further access has occurred and that the scope of potentially affected users is significantly less than recent public speculation.""Suprema added it was in the process of identifying affected parties and engaging with relevant regulators and authorities.There had been concerns that one of the affected clients was the Metropolitan Police, which was reported to have used Suprema technology.However, a spokeswoman told BBC News: ""No Met biometrics systems have been exposed as part of this breach based on our assessment.""The dispute over how big the leak was can be explained by the fact the researchers say they did not, for ethical reasons, attempt to download all the fingerprint files.Rather, they had taken ""hundreds"" of samples of data, said Mr Rotem. And these appeared to encode fingerprint patterns from a random selection of accounts in the Biostar 2 dataset.They then used Suprema's software to convert about half a dozen examples into visible fingerprint patterns.From this, they estimated the dataset contained ""at least over a million"" fingerprint patterns in total.""We have evidence that biometric data was leaked,"" Mr Rotem told BBC News.""We did not download everything, because it would be unethical.""Following the publication of VPNMentor's report on the data exposure, some had questioned the extent to which real fingerprint data had been accessible.However, a security researcher at University College London who was not involved in the work done by Mr Rotem and his team said he understood why the researchers did not download the full dataset, given there may be ethical and legal implications in doing so.""If they see a million files and they download 100 at random, there's a good reason to believe the rest have that data as well,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch.""They're limiting the privacy invasion for legal and ethical reasons.""They've identified a problem - the scale is actually something for the regulator to sort out."""

To date, no-one has been charged.Kate Isaacs, from the #NotYourPorn campaign, said revenge porn was often labelled on Pornhub as ""amateur"" or ""home-made"" content - two popular search terms for videos that were making the site more valuable for advertisers.She now wants the site to do more to delete such content as soon as they are made aware of it, and to prevent it from being reuploaded once taken down.By the time Sophie discovered the videos of her online, she was in a new relationship - and it placed a strain on the couple.Her partner's friends made fun of him over her videos on Pornhub, she said.Sophie also has a teenage daughter, who she said ""hasn't been the same since"".Pornhub dispute one of the videos is Sophie and say it was filmed by a verified model.Pornhub vice-president Corey Price said: ""Content that is uploaded to Pornhub that directly violates our terms of service is removed as soon as we are made aware of it and this includes non-consensual content.""In 2015, to further ensure the safety of all our fans, we officially took a hard stance against revenge porn, which we believe is a form of sexual assault, and introduced a submission form for the easy removal of non-consensual content.""We also use a state-of-the-art third-party digital fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform.""MindGeek told the BBC it was ""not looking to profit off of illegal content or content that violates our terms of service.""It's not in our best interest to host and gain revenue from this type of illegal content. We seek to provide users with a safe space to share and consume content,"" it added.""The last thing we want is to undermine this by allowing revenge porn on our sites.""Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
technology	Minecraft players to be helped by AI assistant	Hand holding	"Tired of digging all those blocks in Minecraft? Help could be at hand from an artificial intelligence assistant that can dig and build on command.Facebook researchers are developing the assistant that players control by typing commands in ordinary language.The team chose Minecraft because the physics of the game are simple and there are limits on the number of ways its blocks can be manipulated.An early version of the assistant has already been made available.The software behind the assistant controls an avatar in the Minecraft game world with which players can communicate.Video demonstrations show the AI assistant being told to build a circle out of wooden blocks and answering questions about what it is doing, asked by the controlling player.In a research paper laying out their aims, the team said they did not want to create yet another AI program that demonstrated ""superhuman"" performance in one sphere such as chess, Go or video games such as Starcraft.""Instead of superhuman performance on a single difficult task, we are interested in competency across a large number of simpler tasks, specified (perhaps poorly) by humans,"" they wrote.The challenge for the research was ensuring the AI can understand typed commands that use ambiguous language, and can then complete a task it has been given, said a blog about the project on the MIT Technology Review site.The relatively small number of blocks and objects making up the Minecraft world, as well as a limit on how they can be combined, provides ""hand holds"" for developing the smart assistant, said the research team.The AI has been programmed to learn from the mistakes it makes interpreting commands, so it can quickly get better at those tasks. This feedback loop will also help it grasp the meaning behind the imprecise language players are likely to use when issuing commands, said the team.The work could also help future AI programs designed to interact with humans and which are controlled by being spoken to."
technology	Virginia bans 'deepfakes' and 'deepnudes' pornography	Deepfakes and DeepnudesDead celebrities	"Virginia has become one of the first places to outlaw the sharing of computer-generated pornography known as deepfakes.The US state has done so by amending an existing law which criminalised so-called revenge porn - the malicious sharing of explicit photos or videos without the victim's consent.It now makes clear that the category includes ""falsely-created"" material.The move coincides with a report critical of the UK's own laws.The study, published by Durham University and Kent University, highlighted that artificial intelligence software had made it much easier to create deepfakes and at the same time the imagery was becoming more difficult to identity as having been manipulated.""We must overhaul our out-of-date and piecemeal laws, including criminalising the paralysing and life-threatening impact of threats, and recognising the significant harms of fake porn,"" said one of the authors, Prof Clare McGlynn.The report said the lack of specific laws covering the issue in England, Wales and Northern Ireland meant the police were often only able to give an informal warning. However, it noted that the law in Scotland was better at covering cases involving altered imagery.Last month, the Ministry of Justice asked the Law Commission to review the issue in England and Wales. However, the independent body is not due to report back until the summer of 2021.""While I welcome the Government's recognition of the need for a comprehensive review of the law, we know that deepfake pornography is harming people right now and any delay means justice delayed,"" commented Prof McGlynn.Fake pornography had initially been dominated by ""photoshopped"" stills which had been created by hand.But last year, some developers applied machine learning techniques to the task, to make it relatively easy to create videos.To make a deepfake, the software involved needs to be fed photos of the subject taken from different angles. An algorithm then uses this information to replace the face of another person in a video with a computer-generated version of the target's, mimicking the original's expressions.After the phenomenon came to light, social media sites including Twitter and Reddit banned instances that featured pornography. However, some other less mainstream platforms still allow the material.Initial uses appeared to have been limited to creating deepfakes of movie stars and other celebrities, but it was not long before perpetrators began discussing using photos scraped from social media of other people.More recently another technique, dubbed DeepNudes emerged.This uses an algorithm which had been trained to take photos of clothed women, and output versions that picture them naked.The app involved was pulled from sale last week, but cracked versions of the software are still circulating via online forums.Virginia's General Assembly passed a bill in March to update its earlier 2014 law to cover such technology, but it only came into effect this week.Those found guilty of the misdemeanour face up to a year in jail and a $2,500 (£1,980) fine.New York State Assembly has also filed a more far-reaching bill that would ban the creation of deepfaked pornography without the consent of the subject, even if they were dead.But that bill is being opposed by the Motion Picture Association of America, which is concerned that the wording is too vague and might prevent the making of biopics featuring digital replicas of dead celebrities."
technology	Spider invasion prompts Mazda software fix	'Terrified'	"Petrol-sniffing spiders have forced Mazda to issue a voluntary recall notice so it can apply a software fix to its cars.The yellow sac spider is attracted to the smell of petrol, and will weave its web in engines, causing a blockage and build-up of pressure.The problem increased the risk of fire, Mazda said.A software update will be applied to recalled cars to monitor the pressure level and warn drivers of any danger.Mazda said it was unaware of any fires being started due to the vulnerability, but it has been a problem that has plagued the company since at least 2009.Specifically, it is Mazda 6s from the 2010-12 range that are covered by this latest recall.It involves around 42,000 vehicles, according to filings made to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.In the documents, Mazda explained: ""A certain type of spider may weave a web in the evaporative canister vent line, potentially causing a restriction in the line.""If this occurs, the fuel tank pressure may become excessively negative when the emission control system works to purge the vapours from the canister.""As the canister is purged repeatedly during normal operation, the stress on the fuel tank may eventually result in a crack, potentially leading to fuel leakage and an increased risk of fire.""Owners of cars affected would have the fault fixed free of charge, the company added.In 2011, Mazda attempted to address the the problem by fitting covers over engine vents to prevent the spiders crawling in - but this was only partially effective, with particularly determined yellow sacs still setting up their homes in the vehicles.When asked by the New York Times why the spiders were causing so much trouble, a Mazda spokesman said: ""Don't ask me, I'm terrified of the damn things."""
technology	Huawei announces its new Harmony operating system		"Huawei has announced it is developing a new operating system called HarmonyOS.There had been speculation that Huawei was planning to replace the Android operating system which powers its smartphones and tablets.In May, Google suspended the company's Android licence after the US government put Huawei on a trade blacklist.However, Huawei said HarmonyOS would first be used in devices such as smart speakers and watches, rather than replacing Android in its phones.""HarmonyOS is completely different from Android and iOS,"" said Huawei's Richard Yu, who announced the project at the Huawei Developer Conference in Dongguan, China.He said the operating system would let developers create one version of their apps and then ""flexibly deploy them across a range of different devices"".Graphics displayed during his presentation did include depictions of smartphones as well as watches, cars and televisions.A majority of smartphones around the world run on some form of the Android operating system, so being cut off from the ecosystem could make Huawei's phones less appealing.There were rumours that the company was going to replace Android in its phones, but Huawei says HarmonyOS will be used to power smart devices such as TVs, speakers and watches - at least to begin with.If the operating system does make its way on to Huawei's phones, consumers will expect to have access to all their favourite apps.But app makers already have their hands full developing their software for Android and Apple's iOS.Huawei will have to convince them to develop yet another version for HarmonyOS, with no guarantee that people will buy the devices.This is a problem faced by anyone hoping to challenge the dominance of Android and iOS.It plagued BlackBerry 10, which never convinced some of the world's biggest apps such as Instagram to support the platform.Rival phone-maker Samsung already has its own Tizen operating system which powers many of its smart devices - but even it uses Android to power its flagship phones.Huawei said it would initially focus the development of HarmonyOS on China, with plans to expand availability globally in the future.It said HarmonyOS would be an open-source platform so that anybody could use the software to create compatible devices.The core of Google's Android OS is also open source, so companies can take the code and use it however they want. This approach is taken by Amazon in its Fire tablets.However, there are restrictions on what phone-makers can do with Android if they want access to the Google Play app store, and to Google's suite of popular apps such as Maps and YouTube.Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy said Huawei's announcement was an ""inevitable move"".But he added: ""Replacing [or] displacing Android is a virtually impossible task.""In China, the new operating system will be called HongmengOS."
technology	Huawei Mate 30 phones launch without Google apps	US blacklistCinema camera	"Huawei has launched its latest smartphones without many of the apps typically pre-installed on Android handsets.The Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro both lack YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail among other software.They also do not feature Google's Play Store, which is the normal way users outside China install third-party software on to Android 10 phones.To address this, Huawei has pre-loaded new alternative apps of its own.A spokesman for the Chinese firm told the BBC that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would all be available via Huawei's own store, called the Huawei App Gallery.He added that there would also be a way to ""side-load"" Google's apps onto the handsets and that phone store staff would advise customers how to do that, although they might not run as smoothly as normal.The issue was not addressed until about 90 minutes into the company's launch event in Munich, Germany, and then only briefly.""Today you know because of the US ban... this phone cannot pre-install the GMS [Google Mobile Services] core,"" explained the firm's consumer devices chief Richard Yu.""It forced us to use the HMS [Huawei Mobile Services] core.""He added that the firm had set aside $1bn (£801m) to encourage developers to make their apps compatible, and said more than 45,000 apps had already integrated the firm's technology. But he did not name any of them.""The hardware is very impressive and differentiating [and] caters to Huawei's strengths,"" commented Bryan Ma from the market research firm IDC.""But it's not enough to offset the lack of Google services aside from a few die-hard [customers] who have the patience to side-load and tolerate possible issues.""Maybe they're just trying to ride it out in the hope that they eventually get access to those Google services later.""One invitee to the launch has tweeted videos showing two of Google's services refusing to work on the Mate 30.Huawei was the world's second bestselling smartphone brand in the past year, behind Samsung.Mr Yu said that the company had experienced 26% growth in demand for its smartphones over the January-to-August period, compared to the same eight months in 2018. He did not specify if the figure referred to sales or shipments.However, analysts suggest sales have started to suffer in Europe after the US added Huawei to a blacklist that prevents many companies from providing the Chinese company with their latest tech.""Having spent billions of dollars over the last 10 years building its brand on a worldwide basis and in key markets like Western Europe, not being able to have Google's full support on its flagship phones is a massive blow,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.""Although there may be some ways to work around the restriction, it's going to be very, very difficult to get people to embrace the phones, because they'll be very concerned that they're missing apps they rely on every day.""The issue should not affect sales in China, where the company has a strong lead over its rivals.Customers there do not use the Play Store and many of Google's services are blocked.Huawei is hoping some of the devices' other features will encourage consumers to overlook the inconvenience they will face in working around the US trade ban.The phones are being billed as the world's first ""second generation"" 5G handsets, promising greater power efficiency and thus longer battery life than other models on the market, as well as the potential for faster internet speeds.Mr Yu claimed they can download data 50% faster than Samsung's Note 10+ 5G, and 25 times faster than the fastest 4G phones.However, this will be dependent on networks providing a strong enough signal. Although all the UK's providers will offer 5G services by the end of 2019, it will likely be years before coverage approaches that of 4G.In addition, the larger Pro model now features four cameras on its rear.These include:The smaller standard model features the same ""super-sensing"" camera, as well as a 16MP wide-angle version and an 8MP telephoto component for portraits.Huawei has long sought to market its smartphones as having superior imaging technology to its rivals.But in this case, analysts suggest it will be a difficult pitch.""No question Huawei packed a lot of features into the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro and their on-stage performance always looks impressive,"" commented Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies.""But how many buyers outside of China will overlook the lack of Google services?""The company also unveiled Huawei Vision - a smart TV with a pop-up camera that can be used to make video calls and get feedback from a fitness exercise app, as well as a new smartwatch and wireless ear buds."
technology	App that can remove women's clothes from images shut down	Revenge victims	"An app that claimed to be able to digitally remove the clothes from pictures of women to create fake nudes has been taken offline by its creators.The $50 (£40) Deepnude app won attention and criticism because of an article by tech news site Motherboard.One campaigner against so-called revenge porn called the app ""terrifying"".The developers have now removed the software from the web saying the world was not ready for it.""The probability that people will misuse it is too high,"" wrote the programmers in a message on their Twitter feed. ""We don't want to make money this way.""Anyone who bought the app would get a refund, they said, adding that there would be no other versions of it available and withdrawing the right of anyone else to use it.The developers also urged people who had a copy not to share it, although the app will still work for anyone who owns it.The team said the app was created as ""entertainment"" a few months ago.This development work led them to set up a website offering Windows and Linux versions of the app. The program was available in two versions - a free one that put large watermarks over created images and a paid version that put a small ""fake"" stamp on one corner.In their statement, the developers added: ""Honestly, the app is not that great, it only works with particular photos.""Despite this, the interest generated by the Motherboard story led the app owner's website to crash as people sought to download the software.Speaking to Motherboard, Katelyn Bowden, founder of anti-revenge porn campaign group Badass, called the app ""terrifying"".""Now anyone could find themselves a victim of revenge porn, without ever having taken a nude photo,"" she told the site. ""This tech should not be available to the public.""The program reportedly uses AI-based neural networks to remove clothing from images of women to produce realistic naked shots.The networks have been trained to work out where clothes are in an image, mask them by matching skin tone, lighting and shadows and then fill in estimated physical features.The technology is similar to that used to create so-called deepfakes, which manipulate video to produce convincingly realistic clips. Early deepfake software was used to create pornographic clips of celebrities."
technology	Shape-shifting software 'defends against botnet hacks'	Morphing code'Additional tool'	"A technology that constantly changes websites' code to defeat hackers has been unveiled by a US start-up.Shape Security says its product works with the HTML, JavaScript and CSS languages, transforming a site's code into a ""moving target"" to prevent cybercriminals from carrying out scripted attacks.The Silicon Valley firm has several high-profile backers including Google.But one expert said hackers might still be able to work round the defence.However, Ron Austin - a senior lecturer on computer security at Birmingham City University - said that it would probably take them longer than previously.Shape says the ""look and feel"" of the sites that use its tech remains unchanged to legitimate visitors.It adds that several companies have already trialled its product, including Citigroup bank and the ticket seller StubHub.Shape describes its product as a being a ""botwall"" - a reference to it being a barrier against automated software tools known as bots that recognise and exploit vulnerabilities in a site's code.These can be used for malicious purposes, such as carrying out DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks - forcing a website server to crash by flooding it with traffic - or to hijack a site, allowing the hacker to modify its contents, steal private details and spread malware.Many products try to prevent such breaches by identifying bots by their signatures - the name they use when registering themselves - and the internet and email addresses they send data to.Hackers have tried to counter detection by using a technique called ""real-time polymorphism"" - making their bots rewrite their own code every time they infect a new machine to make them harder to recognise.Shape says its product reverses this advantage.""The website looks and feels exactly the same to legitimate users, but the underlying site code is different on every page view,"" wrote the firm's founder, Sumit Agarwal, on its blog.""Ultimately, the ShapeShifter aims to stop non-human visitors from executing large-scale automated attacks. This may help break the economics of breaches like the one Target experienced in late 2013, by eliminating the monetisation path.""Without automated scripts, many of today's attacks cease to be economically viable.""Shape had raised $26m (£15.7m) from investors ahead of its product's launch.Backers include:One security expert from the University of Oxford's Internet Institute said the innovation sounded promising.""It's an interesting additional tool for making it harder for attackers to break into systems, and one that can't be trivially circumvented by attackers changing their behaviour,"" Dr Ian Brown told the BBC.But Ron Austin added that given enough time, a dedicated hacker should still be able to achieve their goal.""The caveat to this approach would be looking for parts of the polymorphic code within the software that does not change,"" he explained.""This would then give the attacker a point of reference into the system and possibly allow a new attack to be created. This is difficult and would take time as the attacker would have to monitor the software."""
technology	Android CamScanner PDF app 'sent malware to phones'	I have CamScanner installed, what should I do?	"A hugely popular Android app that takes high quality photographs of documents has been found to contain malware.CamScanner has been downloaded more than 100 million times by Android users.However, cyber-security researchers at Kaspersky say they found that a recent version contained malicious code in the part of the app that delivers ads.The malware could have made it possible to show users intrusive ads or snoop on login credentials.Kaspersky's researchers noted that CamScanner was a ""legitimate"" app, but think that the snippet of malicious code found in it was third-party code used to serve ads within apps.A spokeswoman for Kaspersky told the BBC that researchers did not examine the iPhone version of CamScanner to see if it was also affected.The free version of CamScanner for Android is currently not available on Google's Play Store in the UK.CamScanner said it had released a new version of the app, with the malicious code removed.If you have automatic updates enabled for your apps, which many people do, there is a chance you have a version of CamScanner containing malware on your device.If in doubt, it is best to delete CamScanner and wait for a new version to be launched and tested by cyber-security researchers, said Matthew Hickey at security firm Hacker House.Users may also use an anti-virus app to check for any malicious software that might have been installed.""It is said the average consumer has around 40 applications on their phone they will use frequently, so ensure you regularly review any of those applications that you are not using,"" he told the BBC.Mr Hickey also advised users who have mobile banking apps to be particularly cautious and use an anti-virus app that can regularly check for malicious code.This was important because there had been a ""sharp increase"" recently in discoveries of malware infecting apps on the Google Play app store, he added."
technology	'Hard-to-fix' Cisco flaw puts work email at risk	Hacked hardware	"Security researchers have discovered serious vulnerabilities affecting dozens of Cisco devices.The flaws allow hackers to deceive the part of the product hardware that checks whether software updates come from legitimate sources.Experts believe this could put emails sent within an organisation at risk as they may use compromised routers.Messages sent externally constitute less of a risk, however, as they tend to be encrypted.The California-based firm said it is working on ""software fixes"" for all affected hardware.Red Balloon Security researchers say they have used a software vulnerability to target and make changes to a piece of hardware called the Trust Anchor on one Cisco router.""We've shown that we can quietly and persistently disable the Trust Anchor,"" Red Balloon chief executive Ang Cui, told Wired magazine. ""That means we can make arbitrary changes to a Cisco router, and the Trust Anchor will still report that the device is trustworthy. Which is scary and bad, because this is in every important Cisco product. Everything.""Security experts believe that the vulnerability could cause a major headache for Cisco, which has listed dozens of its products as vulnerable on its website.""We don't know how many devices could have been affected and it's unlikely Cisco can tell either,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert based at Surrey University.""It could cost Cisco a lot of money.""Some have questioned why such a hack was possible in the first place.Most companies use hardware where critical security functions exist in a ""read only"" configuration, meaning that the code in the chip cannot be altered once manufactured, said security expert Andrew Tierney of Pen Test partners.""It's a questionable design decision that Cisco hasn't done this.""The solutions available are limited, said Mr Tierney.""I can't see how a regular user could check whether their device has been hacked and I can't see a way users could secure a compromised device.""Cisco says that because it is repairing a piece of hardware, a fix will require ""on-premise reprogramming.""The company wrote on its website that it is ""in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms."""
technology	Apps for attacks: Software to combat anxiety disorders	Augmented-reality arachnidsCatch your breathHuman touchClose relationship	"From phobias to panic attacks, anxiety disorders can cause major disruption to sufferers' lives. Could smartphones and tablets offer a solution?Spiders used to terrify psychiatrist Russell Green.He recalls one incident, involving a colleague, which led him to flee his workplace.""Her son had tarantulas and she'd brought in the skin that one had shed,"" Dr Green explains.""I just happened to be passing through the entrance to the hospital and she had it in a sandwich box.""I immediately saw it and recognised it as a tarantula and tried to run out of the hospital.""Dr Green's arachnophobia - the exaggerated fear of spiders - is so severe that even a picture of one is enough to scare him.But he has now co-developed Phobia Free, an app designed to help others with the same problem.It uses a technique called systematic desensitisation- a method of slowly exposing sufferers to the object of their phobia.Users first play a series of games with cartoon spiders, which start out as cute and harmless-looking but gradually become more realistic.One early task involves helping a spider hide in a slipper while someone is using a vacuum cleaner.Later players have to help calm down and help an injured tarantula, before finally being presented with a graphic version of the creature superimposed over a real-life view, created using augmented reality.Dr Green's co-founder and fellow psychiatrist Andres Fonseca believes self-help can be hard as it requires willpower and motivation.""We are hoping to get that magic bit of motivation that you get from games, where people will play them for hours and hours, and use that to get people to complete their treatment,"" Dr Fonseca says.They are now working on Agoraphobia Free for people scared of situations that are hard to escape from.Other developers are trying to use games for a different type of anxiety disorder, panic attacks.Computer programmer Simon Fox didn't know what was happening when he experienced his first panic attack six years ago.He excused himself to a quiet room during a New Year's party after feeling anxious.""I felt as though I couldn't breathe,"" he says.What made the 30-minute-long attack worse, he recalls, was that he became worried he might have stopped breathing, which only increased his anxiety,""I just thought I was dying basically,"" he adds.Mr Fox experienced daily attacks over the next few months before seeing a psychiatrist, who taught him coping techniques including breathing exercises.Now he is creating Flowy, a game that aims to teach others how to avoid hyperventilation.He intends to teach users to engage in diaphragmatic deep-breathing, using the large muscle between their chest and the abdomen.To train them, the app will use puzzles involving kittens and robots, which they are instructed to play touching the screen when they inhale and releasing when they exhale. The idea is that the data can also be used to provide feedback, which can be shared with a doctor.The software is due to undergo clinical evaluation in a few weeks' time.Mr Fox suggests it could prove more effective than traditional breathing exercises during an attack.""They're effective but difficult to stick to when you're in that state,"" he says.However some experts, including analytical psychologist Elizabeth Gray, warn that even if these apps prove effective alongside more traditional forms of therapy, they should not be a viewed as a replacement for it.""Without the therapy I don't think the anxiety is cured,"" she explains.She adds that phobias should be overcome by identifying and analysing their underlying causes, adding that this requires a trained therapist.""Therapy is about human relationships,"" Mrs Gray says. ""I think in every therapist's view that's what cures.""Apps are not a substitute for human relationships.""Even so, some believe the close relationship many of us have with our mobile devices gives them anti-anxiety potential.Psychologist Phil Topham is a research fellow at the University of Western England. He led the team that developed Sam, the ""self-help for anxiety management"" app.It offers self-treatment advice, allows users to log their mental and physical states on a variety of screens, and lets them share their experiences anonymously using its ""social cloud"" feature.""People get very attached to their phones and their tablets,"" says Dr Topham, adding that this sense of familiarity can lead sufferers to trust their smart devices with conditions they might not want to share with friends or family.""There's quite a lot of shame attached to anxiety, in not being able to cope,"" he says.""A mobile device is actually a very private device. You're not exposing your anxiety.""But while Dr Topham says the software can be used without the support of a registered health practitioner, he still advises potential users to consult an expert if they have any uncertainties."
